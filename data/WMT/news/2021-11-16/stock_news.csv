This is a positive step forward in our ongoing efforts to serve and protect our communities. As a parent of two school-aged kids, with a husband who teaches, I understand the daily uncertainty parents around the country have been living with. We've dealt with remote learning, hybrid learning and concerns about classroom safety. Many schools reopened this fall but have dealt with interruptions and closings because of COVID-19 outbreaks, so for many, this authorization brings a big sigh of relief. Walmart and Sam’s Club will administer the Pfizer vaccine to eligible children ages 5 to 11 in more than 5,100 pharmacies nationwide starting later this week as supply allows. The FDA and CDC have carefully evaluated the safety and effectiveness data, and after a thorough review, based on strict safety and efficacy standards, they determined the vaccine is safe for children aged 5-11, at one-third of the dose used for adolescents and adults. I know parents have questions, so here are a few things you should know: Check availability via online scheduler: Parents and guardians can use Walmart’s digital appointment scheduler to find an available Pfizer vaccine for their kids in their communities. Simply filter by age, and our tool will show locations administering the Pfizer vaccine in your neighborhood. Initially, supply may be limited, so check availability via the scheduler before heading to the pharmacy. You can make an appointment to reserve your child’s spot in advance, or simply walk in, based on availability. To find a COVID-19 vaccine near you, visit Walmart.com/covidvaccine or samsclub.com/pharmacy/immunizations. The Pfizer vaccine requires two doses, administered three weeks apart: As with adults and adolescents who have been immunized with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, children will need to receive two doses, three weeks apart to be fully vaccinated and protected. Your child’s second appointment will be scheduled at the time of the first dose. Our digital appointment scheduler will send a reminder ahead of the appointment to ensure the second dose is administered on time. Side effects: According to the FDA and CDC, commonly reported side effects in the clinical trial are similar to what’s been seen in adults and other vaccines recommended for children. That could mean a sore arm at the vaccination site, which was the most commonly reported symptom, tiredness, fever or headaches. Side effects were generally mild to moderate in severity and occurred within two days after vaccination, and most went away within one to two days. The CDC recommends a dose of non-aspirin pain reliever or a cold compress at the site if kids are bothered by the side effects. Consent requirements for minors: Please speak with your pharmacist or visit your state department of health website to learn about immunization consent requirements for minors. We have an opportunity to support vaccination efforts with our caring pharmacy team, ready to answer any questions you may have. I like knowing I now have an opportunity to protect my children from this virus that has had such a devastating impact on so many families. Yesterday’s authorization is something to celebrate, so let’s take advantage of the gift this expanded eligibility will bring to protect our kids and communities.",businesswire.com,https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211103005924/en/The-Pfizer-COVID-19-Vaccine-Is-Now-Authorized-for-Children-5-11-and-Will-Be-Available-at-Walmart-and-Sam%E2%80%99s-Club-Pharmacies-Starting-Later-This-Week,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/the-pfizer-covid19-vaccine-is-now-authorized-for-children-20211103.png

The new Lancaster-based facilities will create approximately 1,000 full-time jobs across the region. 40 percent of the new jobs created will require STEM skills to support technical positions. The facilities will play a critical role in Walmart’s supply chain to deliver on the retailer’s promise to get customers the items they want when they want them. Through the combination of Walmart associates and automation technology, the high-tech facilities will move more than two times the volume of a traditional fulfillment and grocery distribution center all while improving the accuracy, quality and speed of the fulfillment and distribution of products. “Walmart is excited to welcome two new high-tech facilities in the Dallas-Fort Worth area to our expanding supply chain network,” said Joe Metzger executive vice president, supply chain operations at Walmart U.S. “These high-tech facilities will include game-changing innovations that are radically disrupting the supply chain, getting products onto store shelves and items shipped to our customers even faster, while saving time for our associates.” “We are making a significant investment in this region because of the inclusive, diverse and qualified pipeline of local talent that reflect Walmart’s values,” said Karissa Sprague, SVP of supply chain human resources at Walmart U.S. “Our investment in technologies and high-tech facilities today pave the way for jobs of the future that are supported by automation and will allow opportunities for an upskilled workforce.” Walmart’s high-tech facilities are part of a larger investment the retailer announced earlier this year to double down on the use of automation technology in its supply chain. It comes just months after the retailer announced its plans to add automation in more than half of its regional distribution centers and automated market fulfillment centers in select stores. The retailer has also made investments in drones and autonomous vehicles to support last mile deliveries. “I, along with my colleagues on the Lancaster City Council, are excited to be working with Walmart as they construct two facilities simultaneously within our community. We look forward to this project bringing more than 1,000 new jobs and helping boost our local economy with an increased daily population. This is a true example of my philosophy that “Positive, progressive partnerships, produce prosperity for all. ‘Working together in a collaborative atmosphere always benefits the whole,” said Clyde C. Hairston, Mayor of the City of Lancaster. “Walmart continues to bring economic viability to the fastest-growing industrial area in the country. We are glad that this new facility will anchor in the Dallas County Inland Port area. This investment is a boon for both Southern Dallas County and Northern Ellis County,” said John Wiley Price, Dallas County Commissioner. Walmart operates 19 distribution centers, 593 retail stores and employs 171,000+ associates in the state of Texas. In FYE 21, stores, clubs and the Walmart Foundation gave $129.2 million in cash and in-kind donations to local Texas organizations. In FY2021 (Feb. 1, 2020 – Jan. 31, 2021), Walmart sourced more than $13.10 billion in goods and services from 2,899 diverse suppliers. And, in March 2021, Walmart Supply Chain launched its Supplier Inclusion Advisory Council to reimagine the retailer’s supplier inclusion initiative. Find out more about Walmart’s diversity and inclusion efforts in the company’s FY2022 Culture, Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Mid-Year Report. Walmart supply chain positions qualify for benefits, a quarterly incentive program and access to a free college degree through Walmart’s Live Better U, which in October 2021, added three leading Historically Black Colleges and Universities in partnership with Guild Education.

Last week, Sam’s Club, Laugh Out Loud and Kevin Hart celebrated five organizations making a big difference in children’s lives by surprising them with $100,000 each through a series of virtual and in-person announcements across the country. In addition to the monetary contribution, select families and children benefitting from the organizations were also surprised to have a unique holiday wish – from laptops to karaoke machines to dollhouses – fulfilled by the trio. The organizations that received the donations are Special Needs Network of Los Angeles, Calif., Houston Child Advocates of Houston, Texas, Boys & Girls Club of Springfield, Mo., Positive Tomorrows of Oklahoma City, Okla., and Boys & Girls Club of Central Fla in Orlando. “One of the best things you can do for yourself is believe in other people,” said Hart. “I’ve always had people in my life that believed in me, and I believe in the power of passing that onto others. The donations we made went to organizations that believe in the future of kids and their families. I’m proud we were able to work together to make a big impact.” Known for bringing laughs on the big screen, Hart brought smiles to many from coast-to-coast in just a few short hours. In each market, families and children were gathered for what they thought was just holiday party organized by Sam’s Club, but they were surprised to dial in to a virtual call and find Hart on the other side of the line. Hart delivered news of the monetary donation and individual gifts on the calls, and Sam’s Club associates were on hand to deliver the items to recipients in person. Hart ended the day by surprising 10 families from the Special Needs Network at a Sam’s Club in Oxnard, Calif. with a holiday shopping spree at Sam’s Club. “These groups have an incredible impact on the communities and families they serve,” said Tony Rogers, senior vice president and chief member officer, Sam’s Club. ""It’s been an honor for us to work together with Kevin and Laugh Out Loud to recognize their work with gifts that allow them to further their missions.” Earlier this month, Sam’s Club, Hart and Laugh Out Loud announced plans to team up and take the holidays “to an 11” this year. The trio share a commitment to doing good in local communities, making this charity component of the holiday campaign a natural fit. About Sam’s Club Sam’s Club®, a division of Walmart Inc.

The United States has set a goal to end the AIDS pandemic by 2030. This June 5, the world marked 40 years since the first five cases of what later became known as AIDS were officially reported and at least 32 million lives were lost. Today, on World AIDS Day, Walmart is part of the solution to addressing the health inequities of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and supporting solutions to change the course of HIV in the United States. “Walmart is committed to providing affordable access to care that is human-centered and makes real progress to address inequities in health care,” said Dr. John Wigneswaran, Walmart’s chief medical officer. “For patients with HIV and populations at greatest risk, Walmart can play an important role in understanding each individual and the unique challenges they face, and our pharmacists play an important role in the treatment paradigm, especially for patients with HIV who may be on a complex medication regimen. We are dedicated to optimizing health by designing best-in-class clinical programs addressing each step of the patient’s health care journey.” As part of this renewed commitment, Walmart has launched a community centered specialty pharmacy strategy building centers of clinical excellence in specific diseases. The first three centers, referred to individually as Specialty Pharmacy of the Community, provide customers with highly specialized pharmacy teams trained in HIV/AIDS medications, clinical services to recognize potential medication-related side effects and assistance to understand the unique needs of people living with HIV/AIDS. These centers will help with all aspects of care, including industry leading clinical programs, pharmacy services provided by HIV-trained pharmacists, enhanced care coordination, healthy lifestyle recommendations and finding emotional support services from our Community Health Workers. Today, the AIDS epidemic disproportionately impacts communities of color, especially in the South, where people are more likely to be diagnosed with HIV over the course of their lifetime than Americans living in other parts of the country. The epidemic also has a significant impact on the LGBTQ+ population, with half of Black gay men and a quarter of Latino gay men projected to be diagnosed with HIV within their lifetime. There are currently 250,000 people in the U.S. southern region who are living with HIV but lack access to treatment, indicating an urgent need for HIV testing, education, prevention, and resources in the area. Walmart and the Elton John AIDS Foundation announced in June that the organizations were working together to help accelerate the end of AIDS in America. On Dec. 1, the teams will host testing events for the third time, joining forces with AIDS Healthcare Foundation and Atlanta Harm Reduction Coalition to provide free HIV testing along with education materials and resources during four parking lot testing events at Walmart locations in Atlanta. The events will focus on expanding access to testing in local communities, a vital first step at effective prevention and treatment for people living with HIV. Walmart also announced, in November, the launch of the Elton John Eyewear, a new line of stylish, accessible eyewear, at both Sam’s Club and Walmart locations. The launch of Elton John Eyewear also furthers Walmart’s support of the Elton John AIDS Foundation’s mission. Walmart Inc. will donate a minimum of $1 million annually from the Elton John Eyewear collection to support the Elton John AIDS Foundation to increase HIV education and awareness and encourage individuals to take the first steps toward a healthier future.
