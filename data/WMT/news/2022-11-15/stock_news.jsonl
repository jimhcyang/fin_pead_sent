Total revenue was $152.8 billion, up 8.7%, or 9.8% in constant currency. Walmart U.S. comp sales grew 8.2% and 17.4% on a two-year stack. eCommerce growth was 16% and 24% on a two-year stack. Continued to gain market share in grocery. Sam’s Club comp sales increased 10.0%, and 23.9% on a two-year stack. Membership income increased 8.0% with member count reaching an all-time high. Walmart International net sales were $25.3 billion, an increase of $1.7 billion, or 7.1%, negatively affected by $1.5 billion from currency fluctuations. Segment operating income led by double-digit growth for Walmex. Global advertising business grew over 30%, led by 40% at Walmart Connect in the U.S. and strength in Flipkart Ads. Consolidated gross profit rate declined 89 basis points, primarily due to markdowns and mix of sales in the U.S., an inflation-related LIFO charge at Sam’s Club, and the timing of Flipkart’s annual event, The Big Billion Days. Consolidated operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 144 basis points due to charges of $3.3 billion related to opioid legal settlements. Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 75 basis points, primarily due to strong sales growth and lower Covid-related costs. Consolidated operating income was $2.7 billion, a decrease of 53.5%, including the legal charges described above. Adjusted operating income was $6.0 billion, an increase of 3.9%. Adjusted EPS of $1.50 excludes the effects, net of tax, of $1.11 from net losses on equity and other investments and $1.05 from charges related to opioid legal settlements.

Walmart International net sales were $25.3 billion, an increase of $1.7 billion, or 7.1%, negatively affected by $1.5 billion from currency fluctuations. Segment operating income led by double-digit growth for Walmex. Global advertising business grew over 30%, led by 40% at Walmart Connect in the U.S. and strength in Flipkart Ads. Consolidated gross profit rate declined 89 basis points, primarily due to markdowns and mix of sales in the U.S., an inflation-related LIFO charge at Sam’s Club, and the timing of Flipkart’s annual event, The Big Billion Days. Consolidated operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 144 basis points due to charges of $3.3 billion related to opioid legal settlements. Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 75 basis points, primarily due to strong sales growth and lower Covid-related costs. Consolidated operating income was $2.7 billion, a decrease of 53.5%, including the legal charges described above. Adjusted operating income was $6.0 billion, an increase of 3.9%. Adjusted EPS of $1.50 excludes the effects, net of tax, of $1.11 from net losses on equity and other investments and $1.05 from charges related to opioid legal settlements. Subsequent to the third quarter the Company approved a new $20 billion share repurchase authorization replacing its existing authorization, which had approximately $1.9 billion remaining at the end of Q3.

Between Nov. 25 and Dec. 25, the retailer is giving customers the opportunity to round up purchases, then donate the change to a favorite charity while shopping on Walmart.com and the Walmart app. Walmart will match customer contributions 1:1, up to $1 million ($2 million total including customer donations), so every dollar goes further. Spark Good Round Up, which launched this fall, allows customers to choose the approved nonprofit they’d like to donate to and set up easy recurring Round Ups on the Walmart app or online. To incentivize customers and nonprofits to take part in the campaign, Walmart is awarding up to 3,000 nonprofits a $1,000 grant when they receive 20 or more Spark Good Round Up donations, for a total contribution of up to $3 million. Participating is easy. After a customer checks out while shopping online or in the app, they will be prompted to search for a favorite charity for their round up donations. Customers can also go to Walmart.com/SparkGood and search for the charity of their choice to receive their Round Up contributions. “Last year, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation gave more than $1.5 billion in cash and in-kind donations to organizations around the world,” said Erin Hogue, a senior director of associate and customer engagement at Walmart. “Giving is in our DNA and it’s clear our customers feel the same. With this $5 million campaign, we’re not only amplifying our customers’ acts of giving through matching donations and grants, we’re also allowing our customers to tell us where they’d like the dollars to go.” The Spark Good Round Up campaign has a number of nonprofits – big and small – for customers to choose. But if a customer can’t find the local cause they want to support, they can send a referral link directly to the 501(c)(3) of their choice. Spark Good, Walmart’s newest giving initiative, brings the retailer’s nonprofit tools together under one umbrella. From local grant opportunities to registries for their most-needed items, Spark Good gives nonprofits one convenient place to work with Walmart in making a difference in local communities. Together, we can Spark Good this holiday season. To learn more, visit Walmart.org/SparkGood. About Walmart Walmart Inc.
