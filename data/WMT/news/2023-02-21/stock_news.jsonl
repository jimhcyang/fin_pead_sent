The three-year deal will leverage Walmart’s position as a retailer and provider of health and wellness services, and CareSource’s role in the administration and delivery of Medicaid, Medicare and other health plan benefits and services. The two companies will aim to cultivate innovative, evidence-based solutions to improve health outcomes in under-resourced and underserved communities where racial health inequities are widespread. “Our goal is to utilize our combined assets to create healthier individuals and communities,” said Walmart Vice President of Social Determinants of Health Warren Moore. “We’re trying to close the gaps in care and promote positive health behavior change through holistic, culturally sustaining, and high-quality health and wellness solutions. CareSource is the ideal partner to help bring this vision to life,” he continued. The partnership will begin in Ohio, with a focus on cardiometabolic conditions (heart disease, stroke, diabetes, hypertension). According to the most recent data from the Centers for Disease Control, heart disease, stroke and diabetes were among the top 10 leading causes of death in the state.1 To address this, the partnership will utilize Walmart’s in-store Community Health Workers to facilitate the completion of state-approved health risk and social needs assessments, and connect select CareSource members to community resources, life skills support, and health literacy education. Eligible CareSource members will receive monthly funds to spend on food, a Walmart + membership for no cost delivery, and access to tele-nutrition services to aid in improving their health outcomes. CareSource members will also be able to take part in CareSource Life Services®, which includes including CareSource JobConnect™, to provide a path to financial empowerment and improve both economic mobility and health outcomes. The two entities will also work together on a maternal and child health program to support positive lifestyle behavior change and improve maternal and child health outcomes in Georgia, the state with the second-highest maternal mortality rate in the country. Under the agreement, expecting mothers or mothers that are 12-months post-partum and enrolled in CareSource’s Georgia Medicaid managed care plan will have access to Walmart in-store Community Health Workers, a “directed spend” program providing monthly funds to spend on food, tele-nutrition services, tele-doula services and will receive a Walmart+ membership. “This partnership will address the major needs our members face, which are difficulty with transportation, access to healthy food, access to care and assistance with care coordination,” said CareSource Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer Dr. David Williams. Dr. David further stated, “We know providing additional support, such as an in-store community health worker, will create another access point to ensure our members have the resources they need, within a location they frequent. As a result of this relationship, we expect an immediate, positive impact in the lives of our members.” About Walmart Walmart Inc.

This feature — provided in partnership with The Trade Desk and LiveRamp (RAMP) — leverages first-party member data, advertiser data and AI-powered, real-time behavioral insights from Sam’s Club to make advertising campaigns smarter, more effective and more personalized. Advertisers have long been challenged to better optimize retargeting, but often wind up bombarding consumers with repetitive or irrelevant ads due to inaccurate and incomplete data. Sam's Club MAP is uniquely positioned to solve this challenge because it uses real-time, accurate data from registered Sam's Club members, including exact data on purchase history, demographics, recent purchases of similar items and basket size — data not available on other retail media platforms. As a result, MAP campaigns can deliver personalized ads in real time to members who’ve expressed interest in a product but have not yet made a purchase. And MAP campaigns are smart enough to stop serving ads to members — even when they are not on Sam’s Club properties — once the member makes a related purchase. “We’re obsessed with helping our members. We’ve all had the experience of seeing ads for items we have already purchased. Our solution allows us to avoid that irritation, creating a better member experience and greater efficiencies for brands. Advertisers are now able to target based on what we know members are actually in market for, right now,” said Austin Leonard, Head of Sales, Sam’s Club Member Access Platform. “We can then stop serving these members ads once they complete their purchase at any Sam’s Club or on any device. This is a unique solution brand partners have been waiting for and an additive experience for our members.” Advertisers are already excited about the feature. “We’ve been waiting a long time to be able to retarget using the real-time data that Sam’s Club has. This allows us to automate targeting, personalize messaging and create sophisticated media workflows that maximize the efficiency of our campaigns,” said Mic Zavarella, Vice President of Marketing at PepsiCo. This solution uses leading technology to make it easier for brands to feel comfortable investing in the platform, including automated audience building, onboarding and targeting. It brings scale, uniqueness and safe data clean room technology for all members and brands. With this new integration, Sam’s Club MAP is able to use The Trade Desk’s award-winning KOA Optimization technology to leverage AI and machine learning to optimize results in flight. Integrating with LiveRamp’s industry-leading data permissioning and access controls ensure safe and secure collaboration with MAP's supplier brands. MAP retargeting automatically connects ads to membership data and member behavior, delivering tangible results, including incremental ROAS (return on ad spend), all 3rd party verified by IRI. Advertisers are able to track those results, including iROAS, right up to the point of sale, by using MAP’s reporting feature. Sam’s Club MAP offers advertisers real-time retargeting for a variety of scenarios, including: A member has browsed a specific item on samsclub.com, or placed an item in their cart, but did not complete the purchase. A member visited a specific landing page, brand page or shelf page on samsclub.com, but did not make a purchase. A member placed an order online to be picked up in club but still plans to shop the club while they’re there – like many members do. MAP’s real-time retargeting allows advertisers with complementary products to deliver relevant ads between order placement and club check out effectively allowing advertisers to “Win the Second Cart”. “Retargeting is a tried and true tactic in the ecommerce and digital media world for Nestle Purina. We’re excited to see the power of omnichannel data come to retargeting that can drive both performance and brand awareness at scale,” said Tony DiMattia, Director and Head of Shopper Marketing at Nestle Purina. By eliminating irrelevant retargeting, Sam’s Club MAP improves the experience of members as they browse the open web. It also allows advertisers to use their spend more efficiently by not targeting members who are no longer in the market for their products. With these campaigns, advertisers are able to leverage data from omnichannel conversions, including those in-club and online, delivering greater incremental sales and improving the member experiences.

Bridge is a digital platform that connects SMBs with a diverse group of more than 70 lenders that provide qualifying businesses with loans of up to $10 million. Through a single loan request form, Walmart suppliers can interact with a broad group of lenders located across the United States. Once a request is submitted, the platform seamlessly connects suppliers with multiple potential lenders that can evaluate their requests. This provides for a more efficient loan process for both the suppliers and lenders and empowers suppliers by offering them greater choice, convenience, and access to capital. It also provides lenders with the potential to expand their reach beyond their immediate local market and diversify their lending businesses. In preparation for this launch, the platform’s lender base has grown from 18 banks in 2021 to more than 70 lenders nationwide currently on the platform. “At Walmart, we know small- and medium-sized businesses are the engine that drives the U.S. economy and local communities. Many diverse owned businesses also fit the small- and medium-sized business profile. As such we stand to strengthen our longstanding Supplier Inclusion offering through this specific opportunity,” said Jason Fremstad, Senior Vice President of Supplier Development at Walmart. “By leveraging the platform, our suppliers can have better access to the funding they need to expand their operations to reach and surpass their goals. Greater access to capital will help our suppliers continue to provide the products that our customers are looking for.” Working capital loans, commercial mortgages and other pre-shipment financing loans are among the potential loans extended by some of the lenders on the platform. Walmart has programs that help with post-shipment financing, but Bridge built by Citi has the potential to expand options available to qualifying suppliers. Bridge was developed to provide more inclusive access to capital while supporting innovative, digital-first solutions for SMBs. “Many small and medium-sized business owners don’t have a network of existing bank relationships – especially those operating in underrepresented communities,” said Rohit Mathur, Head of the Bridge built by Citi platform. “Bridge offers a modern and efficient way for Walmart’s U.S. suppliers to navigate the lending process and cultivate relationships with multiple lenders while helping them gain access to the capital that is essential for them to grow.” In preparation for engaging Walmart’s supplier network, Citi focused on increasing the number of Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs) and Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) on the platform. Of the more than 70 lenders currently participating on the Bridge built by Citi platform, more than 20 are MDIs and four are women-owned institutions. In addition, 15 of the 20 Black-owned banks in the U.S. are lenders on the platform. Citi and Walmart are proud to help introduce suppliers to financial institutions that are committed to serving their communities and promoting racial and gender equity. M&F Bank in North Carolina has used the platform to source opportunities to lend hundreds of thousands of dollars to businesses they would not have found otherwise. “We’re proud to be part of a platform that enables us to connect with our target market in a more intentional and efficient way and are excited to now extend our reach to Walmart’s extensive supplier network,” says M&F Bank CEO James Sills. “By growing and diversifying our business mix, Bridge enables us to make even more of a positive impact on the communities we serve.” In addition to the introduction of Bridge built by Citi to Walmart suppliers, Walmart and Citi will also collaborate to provide suppliers with educational content to increase financial literacy. “At Citi, we are focused on delivering innovative solutions that create value for our clients and contribute to a more inclusive and efficient financial ecosystem. This includes our collaborations with clients and partners such as Walmart to identify optimal paths for the solutions we are creating,” says Emily Turner, Head of Business Development, Institutional Clients Group at Citi. Walmart suppliers can access the platform and review terms of use through a dedicated website: www.bridgebuiltbyciti.com/walmart. Note: Neither Walmart nor Citi have any influence in lending decisions, nor do they participate as lenders on the platform. Bridge helps to facilitate the establishment of an independent relationship between a prospective borrower and one or more lenders. About Walmart Walmart Inc.
