These offers are available through the Emergency Broadband Benefit Program (EBB),1 and customers can find eligible plans on Walmart.com and in more than 2,300 Walmart stores across the country. If signing up for an eligible plan at Walmart, customers must complete their EBB enrollment with AT&T PREPAID or Cricket. EBB is a temporary federal government program that provides eligible customers a temporary benefit of up to $50/mo. on eligible home internet or wireless service. Eligible households on qualifying Tribal lands can receive a benefit of up to $75/mo. Leaders from Walmart and AT&T reiterated their commitment to making the internet more accessible to all Americans, especially those most impacted by the pandemic. “The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the digital divide in America as many underserved households were unable to afford broadband connectivity to work from home or enable their children to participate in remote learning. Through our collaboration with AT&T, we are staying true to our mission and making this important resource available to our customers at an affordable price,” said Mehrdad Akbar, vice president of wireless and photo services, at Walmart U.S. “This isn’t a problem that was created overnight, nor will it be solved quickly, but every step in the right direction helps.” “This past year dealt a financial blow to many Americans. To help address this, Walmart and the AT&T Prepaid Portfolio are teaming up to support the communities we serve and do our part in helping to bridge the digital divide that exists across the country,” said John Dwyer, President of the AT&T Prepaid Portfolio (includes Cricket Wireless). “Offering plans eligible for the Emergency Broadband Benefit Program to eligible customers is just another way we can work together to make life easier for those who have been financially impacted over the past year.” If you’ve been financially affected by COVID-19 or currently participate in financial assistance programs such as SNAP or Medicaid, you could be eligible for temporary relief on an AT&T PREPAID or Cricket Wireless plan. Customers who qualify for the EBB program have multiple options to find the best plan for their needs. Families on the move or working at home can connect to the internet with a mobile hotspot device on a data-only plan. The mobile hotspot with a data-only plan delivers internet access to up to 15 Wi-Fi enabled devices like a computer, a tablet, and more. If what you need is voice service and wireless internet access on your phone, then a smartphone plan is a great choice.

Officially re-launching this week, Taste & Tips allows members to sample food and review products when they visit the club. Initially, Taste & Tips will take place on the weekends and in limited quantities, using new safety measures, such as sealed samples. Sam’s Club’s sampling program has been an attraction in clubs for more than 35 years, but it was paused last March out of concern for the health and safety of members and associates during COVID-19. “Over the past year, our members’ shopping behaviors have evolved,” said Megan Crozier, Chief Merchandising Officer, Sam’s Club. “Today, more than ever, members want to do more than just shop when they come to our clubs – they want to have an experience. In addition to the return of Taste & Tips, we’ve planned new, immersive sampling experiences that add even more excitement to our clubs.” One such experience is the first-ever Member’s Mark Summer Eats Food Truck. It will tour the central United States this summer, giving members a chance to experience the quality of Sam’s Club’s private brand, Member’s Mark. The event will take sampling out of the club and into the parking lot with a food truck serving up hearty helpings of popular Member’s Mark foods, like Member's Mark Angus Beef Cheeseburgers, Member’s Mark Baked Beans with Brisket and Member’s Mark Double Dipped Mini Ice Cream Bars. Additionally, Sam’s Club is testing new ways to sample items, such as roaming events that bring sampling directly to members as they checkout, visit the member services desk or use Sam’s Club Curbside Pickup. Sampling is available at all of Sam’s Club’s nearly 600 clubs in the United States. To find a location, visit www.SamsClub.com. About Sam’s Club Sam's Club®, a division of Walmart Inc.
