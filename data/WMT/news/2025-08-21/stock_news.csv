Analysts at Oppenheimer reiterated an outperform rating on Walmart, with a price target of $115 from $110. “Following a more difficult backdrop to start the year due to unexpected tariff and expense headwinds, we believe a positive guidance revision cycle could again materialize soon,” said the firm, as also quoted by CNBC. The Nasdaq is pushing even higher. Last trading at 23,995 in premarket, it could easily test 25,000 over the next few days. Helping, inflation data was tamer than expected, cooling investor fears that tariffs are not having a substantial impact on prices. With the latest data, investors are also pricing in a 90% chance of an interest rate cut at the Federal Reserve’s September meeting.

Piper Sandler just raised its price target on Nvidia ahead of earnings Piper Sandler just raised its price target on Nvidia ahead of earnings, calling for the stock to hit $225 a share. The firm also has an overweight rating on the tech giant. “We are expecting another positive quarter from NVDA and see upside to numbers for both the July and October quarters,” said the firm, as quoted by CNBC. “While we are modeling largely in-line for the July quarter and slightly below Street for October, we are calling for upside given the recent positive commentary from U.S. hyper scalers as well as the inclusion of revenues from China,” added the firm. Nvidia will release its quarterly numbers on August 27. Analysts are looking for EPS of $1 on revenue of $45.76 billion. CoreWeave dropped on better-than-expected revenue CoreWeave just posted better-than-expected revenue of $1.21 billion, which was ahead of estimates of $1.08 billion.

For the full year, the company expects for revenue to range from $ 5.15 billion to $5.35 billion, which is above expectations for $5.05 billion revenue. Stock Upgrade: Palo Alto Networks (PANW) Ahead of earnings on August 18, PANW saw two upgrades. Both Piper Sandler and Deutsche Bank upgraded their ratings for PANW to a buy rating. Piper Sandler raised its price target to $225 from $200. Deutsche Bank raised its target to $220 from $200. After tacking on $7.23 just yesterday, PANW is up another $3 in premarket. Plus, according to Wedbush analysts, PANW’s recent $25 billion acquisition of CyberArk could reshape the cybersecurity market. &#8220;We view this move as a strategic home run deal by PANW to strengthen its platformization strategy with PANW on the acquisition hunt further to build an all-in-one shop for all cyber solutions to battle the rising threats from AI while injecting this technology into its broader portfolio,&#8221; said Wedbush analysts, as quoted by Seeking Alpha. &#8220;This represents a key strategic poker move by the cyber stalwart with the expanding competitive landscape within cyber as PANW brings on the most dominant player within the Privileged Access Management space.&#8221; The post Nasdaq Composite Live: Index Heading to Higher Highs appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com,https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/08/13/nasdaq-composite-live-index-heading-to-higher-highs/,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/nasdaq-composite-live-index-heading-to-higher-highs-20250814.jpg

(NASDAQ:AMZN) gained 3.90% over the past five trading sessions, bringing the e-commerce and cloud storage solutions stock&#8217;s year-to-date gain to 4.91%. Over the past year, it is up 29.63%. AMZN&#8217;s most recent catalyst came in mid-August when the company announced it will begin offering customers same-day grocery delivery. On July 8, it was reported that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos sold nearly three million shares worth $665.8 million over two days in July as part of a plan announced earlier in 2025 that will see Bezos unload up to 25 million shares through May 2026. In its Q2 earnings call on July 31, the company reported that net sales increased 13% to $167.7 billion in the second quarter, compared with $148.0 billion in the year-prior quarter. Net income increased to $18.2 billion, or $1.68 per diluted share, compared with $13.5 billion, or $1.26 per diluted share, in Q2 2024. However, free cash flow decreased to $18.2 billion TTM, compared with $53.0 billion TTM the year prior due to Amazon&#8217;s ongoing CapEx on AI. In June and July the stock saw a series of adjusted price targets. Analysts at Stifel ($262 from $245), Barclays ($275 from $240), Bank of America ($272 from $265), Piper Sandler ($255 from $250), Capital ($270 from $233), Citi ($265 from $225), Needham ($265 from $220), Cantor Fitzgerald ($260 from $240), Truist ($250 from $226), all recently upgraded their price targets for AMZN. Amazon announced in July that it has deployed its 1 millionth robot while also deploying its new AI foundation model to power its robotic fleet. Its first twelfth generation automated fulfillment center launched in late-2024 and the robots are primarily focused on delivery station efficiencies. The robotics cycle is &#8220;early,&#8221; according to Bank of America&#8217;s analyst, who expects Amazon to leverage robots to reduce labor dependency, increase order accuracy and improve warehouse efficiency, driving material cost savings. While there can be little doubt about Amazon&#8217;s current financial health, investors and potential investors may be right to wonder whether growth can continue at Amazon&#8217;s historic pace, and whether the stock is safe as a long-term holding. Let&#8217;s take a look at where the share price could be headed. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: Amazon is facing substantial headwinds this year, but the stock remains fundamentally sound with a &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; rating. AWS, AI and ad sales continue to be major drivers for the Magnificent Seven stock. If you’re looking for a megatrend with massive potential, make sure to grab a complimentary copy of our “The Next NVIDIA” report. This report breaks down AI stocks with 10x potential and will give you a huge leg up on profiting from this massive sea change. Why Invest in Amazon? In the past 20 years, Amazon&#8217;s stock is up more than 9,491%. The company has been called one of the most influential economic and cultural forces in the world, and its brand is one of the world&#8217;s most valuable. Though the stock tumbled as the COVID-19 pandemic waned and lockdowns ended (along with the broader markets), it has more than recovered. Shares of this Magnificent Seven member hit an all-time high on Feb. 4, 2025, but with the Nasdaq briefly entering bear market territory in March, it had been downhill for Amazon in 2025. There have been signs of hope recently, with AMZN rebounding along with the broad market. It is hard to imagine that the company or its share price will collapse any time soon, but analysts and investors may see the stock as overbought. Let&#8217;s see what Wall Street expects. Amazon as a Company The company engages in the retail sale of consumer products, advertising, and subscriptions service through online and physical stores internationally. It also manufactures and sells electronic devices and develops and produces media content. Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides compute, storage, database, analytics, machine learning, and other services. And Amazon Prime is the company&#8217;s membership program. Amazon is based in Seattle. It was founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos, the former chief executive officer and now executive board chair. Amazon went public in May 1997. Its retail competitors include Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE:BABA), Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT). It also competes with the likes of Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT). The company continues its push into artificial intelligence with an update of its Alexa feature to Alexa+. AWS investments in cloud computing and AI also continue, with the former being the world&#8217;s largest cloud services provider and the latter nearing its debut of its &#8220;Nova&#8221; chatbot, which will compete in price with ChatGPT. Additionally, Amazon has been expanding its same-day delivery services, and its entertainment division has secured the James Bond franchise with the acquisition of MGM Studios. Headwinds include ongoing labor issues. The most recent quarterly results showed strong performance, with AWS as a major growth driver. Amazon as a Stock Wall Street analysts&#8217; median price target of $265.22 is above Amazon&#8217;s all-time high share price seen earlier this year and good for potential upside of 14.79%. Of the 45 analysts covering AMZN, all but one assign it a &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating, with the other assigning it a &#8220;Hold&#8221; rating. Overall, the stock receives a consensus &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; rating. With 64.88% of shares held by institutional investors — including notable stakes from the three largest asset management companies, Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street — the stock is popular among Wall Street&#8217;s sell-side firms. Institutional holdings of Amazon have seen net increase with 3,196 position increases versus 2,166 position decreases. Wall Street expectations for where the stock goes in the next 52 weeks vary. While analysts overall anticipate healthy upside, the lowest price target indicates a decline in the share price. The consensus projection signals strong upside potential for the next 52 weeks, based on strong forward guidance for business segments like AWS and Prime Video&#8217;s ad sales, which saw enormous year-over-year increases as the platform now hosts the NFL&#8217;s Thursday Night Football programming. Estimate Price Target %Change From Current Price Low $240 3.88% Median $265.22 14.79% High $300.00 29.85% Amazon does face some headwinds and risks in addition to those mentioned above. Consumer spending has rebounded in the wake of Trump&#8217;s tariff threats and subsequent pauses, which could help GDP in Q2 after it contracted GDP in Q1, raising the risks of a possible recession in 2025. Over the past three months, the consumer discretionary sector of the S&amp;P 500 — into which Amazon falls — has performed the third best, posting a gain of 6.22%. While the company dominates in the retail space and is a tech leader, competition in neither category is likely to go away anytime soon. All these things could have a huge impact on profitability. Despite some skeptics, the prospects for Amazon are optimistic overall, especially in the short term. Wall Street&#8217;s &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; consensus rating and the upside potential far outweigh the downside potential shares of AMZN face.

At the moment, the Nasdaq is down about 45 points. The Dow is down about 19, with the S&amp;P 500 down about eight points. The Federal Reserve will remain in focus this week, as central bank members meet in Jackson Hole, Wyoming for their annual symposium. Investors will be listening for any clues about the future path of interest rates. As noted by Yahoo Finance, “Ahead of Powell&#8217;s speech — likely to be his last as Fed chair — markets are placing the probability the Fed will cut rates by at least 0.25% next month at around 85%. Clues from Powell about the speed and depth of the cycle the Fed is about to embark on will be the week&#8217;s biggest market-moving event.” Aside from the central bank, investors are waiting on earnings from Home Depot, Lowe’s, Target, and Walmart. All are under the microscope, with concerns about the strength of the U.S. consumer mounting. Helping, analysts at Evercore ISI just added Target to its tactical outperform list, noting that Target earnings could be better than expected. “So, in our view, a relief rally could result, especially if trends into 2H show any BTS (back to school) improvement, with potential mgmt change and stimulus proving hope into 2026. In recent days, much has been made of the Target / Ulta partnership ending, yet we believe Target is hunting for new partners and/or opportunities to scale, for example, with Warby Parker,” as quoted by CNBC. Stock Upgrades: RBC Capital Just Upgraded Sunrun RBC Capital analysts just upgraded Sunrun to an outperform rating with a price target of $16 from $12. As a catalyst, the firm pointed to guidance from the Treasury Department on how renewable projects might qualify for tax credits. “While the act terminates investment and production tax credits for solar and wind projects after 2027, projects that start construction within 12 months of the passage of the act can still claim credits beyond this deadline,” according to CNBC. Bank of America reiterated a buy rating on Apple, noting, “Services has been, and we expect will continue to be, the leading driver of y/y gross profit dollar growth. Reiterate Buy on stable cash flows, earnings resiliency, and strong capital return program.” Morgan Stanley reiterated its overweight rating on Nvidia, giving it a $206 price target. The firm noted, “While the near-term bar is higher now, the 12-month picture across demand, supply, and competitive outlook all continue to be very favorable.” The post Nasdaq Composite Live: All Eyes are on Jackson Hole Symposium appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com,https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/08/18/nasdaq-composite-live-all-eyes-are-on-jackson-hole-symposium/,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/nasdaq-composite-live-all-eyes-are-on-jackson-hole-20250818.jpg
