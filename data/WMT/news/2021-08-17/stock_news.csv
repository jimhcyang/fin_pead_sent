Low-cost flu shots are now available in 4,600+ Walmart pharmacies nationwide via walk-up and community flu shot clinics.

Between COVID-19 vaccines and the annual flu shot, we know people may be experiencing ‘vaccine fatigue,’ but these preventive measures have never been more vital to keeping our communities healthy,” Del Sloneker, senior vice president and chief operating officer, Health and Wellness, said. “It’s on all of us to do our part and is just another way we’re making it simple to live better, healthier lives.” Walmart’s flu shots are administered by certified pharmacists and health care professionals who are trusted members of their communities and understand local health needs. In addition to just being able to walk-in, Walmart also continues to have a variety of initiatives in place to make it easy to get vaccinated while following COVID-19 safety protocols, including hosting flu shot clinics in select markets. These events will make it quick, easy and convenient for customers to get flu shots in stores nationwide. Walmart is a center of well-being in the communities it serves and has everything busy families need to live better, healthier, lives this flu season. This includes our pharmacists who can answer any medication related questions, COVID-19 tests, prescription and over-the-counter medication, as well as a variety of immunizations, including COVID-19, flu, measles, mumps, rubella (MMR), varicella (chicken pox), HPV, tetanus, whooping cough (TDAP) and more. In addition, we have low-cost grocery items, ranging from immunity boosting foods to soup and comfort foods.

But occasionally, we find ourselves in a position to ask one simple question: How can we help? We’ve watched with the rest of the world as events unfold in Afghanistan. There are thousands of human lives at stake. They belong to generations of Afghan people whose history and culture are inextricably tied to the American men and women who have served in Afghanistan over our decades-long involvement there. Throughout Walmart’s history, serving people and communities has been at the center of everything we do. We’re proud that our associates reflect the communities we serve, and we’ve heard from members of those communities – including Afghan and veteran associates – that they’re ready to help. Here’s how: We’re looking to the cross-cultural experience of our veteran and Afghan associates to support refugees, service members and one another, as veteran leaders at Walmart explore ways to support these efforts. We’re offering options for customers to get involved. And the Walmart Foundation is committing $1 million to three nonprofits supporting Afghan refugees entering the U.S., as well as veterans and their families. I know that for anyone who has traveled to Afghanistan, or worked with its citizens, what we’re witnessing is difficult. Afghan nationals have served alongside U.S. troops as translators, emissaries and soldiers in a fight against terror. These are people who have directly saved American lives, and now, we’re trying to help facilitate their access to some part of the freedom and future we’ve spent so long working toward together. To the thousands of our associates who have served, we’re here to listen and provide support. But we’ll also look to your proven leadership. Many of you have a unique understanding of Afghanistan and its people. It’s our hope that through a shared experience, you can help one another, as you have before. To our customers, we know that many of you are looking for opportunities to help those in need too. We’re working closely with nonprofits that are supporting the refugee crisis, and military veterans and families, to stand up registries on Walmart’s Registry for Good. Through the $1 million committed, the Walmart Foundation will support three organizations in aiding incoming refugees, as well as veterans and their families. No One Left Behind and the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service will continue their work with special immigrant visas (SIV), providing support as refugees enter the country. And the Tragedy Assistance Program For Survivors (TAPS) will increase the capacity of its National Military Survivor Helpline, which provides 24/7 support for veterans, military spouses and family members of America’s fallen heroes. We can help make a difference for Afghanistan’s refugees, our veterans and their families. Walmart’s purpose calls us to it. In moments of crisis, we support our communities – not just physical places, but the people who carry their culture. Walmart stands ready to continue that commitment in the weeks and months to come. Together, we must continue asking: How can we help?

I joined Walmart at the beginning of August because of the tremendous impact the company has on supporting and caring for our communities during the pandemic. I’m proud to support the teams as we’ve expanded our vaccinations to include third doses of the COVID-19 vaccine for immunocompromised individuals, along with our low-cost flu shots. We stand ready to administer booster shots this fall once recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the coming weeks. Third Shot vs. Booster Shot: Which One Is Right for You? There are two different types of “3rd doses” of the COVID-19 vaccines: an additional vaccine dose and a booster shot. An additional vaccine dose can help increase the immune response in immunocompromised individuals who are less able to fight infections and are more vulnerable to infections like the COVID-19 virus. The Moderna or Pfizer vaccines, which both require two shots, are the only vaccines authorized at this time to be administered as a third dose to people who are moderately to severely immunocompromised. A booster shot is a dose of vaccine administered when the initial immune response has begun to fade. This booster shot is what you’re currently hearing about as likely being necessary to prolong the protections and maximize the benefits of the COVID-19 vaccines. As cases of the highly contagious Delta variant and hospitalizations continue to rise, medical experts are recommending booster shots, based on data that shows waning immunity around six to eight months after the second dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. More data is needed on booster shots tied to the J&J vaccine, which is expected in the next few weeks. While Walmart and Sam's Club pharmacies are currently administering third doses to immunocompromised individuals, we will only administer booster shots to eligible fully vaccinated Americans once recommendations have been issued by the CDC and FDA. Focusing on solutions As we prepare to administer millions of booster shots, we will continue to focus on solutions that make it as easy as possible for our customers to get vaccinated. We have already shown we can make a real difference in our communities through our non-profit, community-based and state and local government partnerships to improve access to the vaccine. We’ve conducted more than 600 community vaccine clinics to date in partnership with local organizations, to help us reach communities and get more shots in arms, especially for those most vulnerable and at risk. Interested customers can find more information by visiting Walmart.com/covidvaccine. More Americans than ever are getting vaccinated. We continue to see increases in new vaccinations across Walmart stores, and according to the CDC, nearly 203 million people have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, while more than 171 million are fully vaccinated. Additional vaccinations in the form of a third dose or a booster shot is standard for many other vaccines and can help extend the protections and benefits of the initial vaccination. Here to Help Our pharmacies nationwide are here to help, as we have been throughout the pandemic, and we will continue to administer vaccines. Together, we can successfully meet the challenges of the pandemic, but it’s important we don’t let our guard down as we enter this new stage. Please do your part: Get vaccinated, and get your booster shot once you are eligible. I know I and my family will, and I’ll be proudly standing with my Walmart and Sam's Club colleagues as we work to administer vaccines to our communities across the country.",businesswire.com,https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210831005976/en/Walmart-Stands-Ready-To-Administer-Millions-of-COVID-19-Vaccine-Booster-Shots,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/walmart-stands-ready-to-administer-millions-of-covid19-vaccine-20210831.png
