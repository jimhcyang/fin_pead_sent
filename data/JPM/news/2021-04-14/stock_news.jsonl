JPMorgan Chase Commercial Banking has named Brian Lehman as the Head of Green Economy. Lehman, who will build a dedicated team of bankers to serve the segment, has more than 20 years of client-facing experience and deep knowledge of sustainable finance. He most recently led the Diversified Financials team within Commercial Banking’s Financial Institutions Group. “The path to a more sustainable future heavily depends on our actions today,” said Brian Lehman, Commercial Banking’s Head of Green Economy. “At JPMorgan Chase, we’ve seen a growing number of clients and industries whose foundations are built upon reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Our Green Economy banking team will not only deliver industry-specific advice, solutions and services to help green enterprises grow, but will also use our leadership position to promote a more sustainable world.” The new Green Economy team will initially focus on four industry sectors: renewable energy, efficiency technology, sustainable finance, and agriculture and food technology. Leveraging the full breadth of JPMorgan Chase’s offerings across treasury, credit and investment banking, the Green Economy team will utilize their expertise to help clients address operational challenges and fuel the growth of green businesses at large. In addition to offering traditional banking services, the team will focus on providing community-minded financial solutions for clients, including green and environmental bonds. “Sustainability, including the need to address climate change, is important to JPMorgan Chase and many of our clients,” said Doug Petno, CEO of Commercial Banking at JPMorgan Chase. “We’re excited to launch our Green Economy team, which will expand our capabilities to meet the changing needs of our clients and support the growth of industries and companies that will help make the world a better place for us all.” The announcement of the new team builds upon JPMorgan Chase’s efforts to advance sustainable solutions, including the adoption of a Paris-aligned financing strategy in 2020 to help clients navigate the challenges and capitalize on the long-term economic and environmental benefits of transitioning to a lower-carbon world. Additionally, the firm committed to facilitating $200 billion in 2020 for transactions that support climate action and efforts to advance sustainable development.

The firm will bring together its capital and expertise to help clients, customers and communities address these vital issues. This long-term target complements the firm’s Paris-aligned financing strategy and will help accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy by encouraging actions that set a path for achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. The firm will share an update and additional information on its Paris-aligned strategy with the release of its annual ESG Report this May. Last year, the firm also established the J.P. Morgan Development Finance Institution (DFI) to grow the development finance activities undertaken by J.P. Morgan and attract additional investment to the emerging markets. The new 10-year effort announced today will further the DFI’s objective to promote economic and social development. “Climate change and inequality are two of the critical issues of our time, and these new efforts will help create sustainable economic development that leads to a greener planet and critical investments in underserved communities,” said Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase. “Business, government and policy leaders must work together to support long-term solutions that advance economic inclusion, bolster sustainable development and further the transition to a low-carbon economy. We are committed to doing our part.\" Supporting Clean Energy and Sustainable Development The new $2.5 trillion effort will be focused on the following objectives: Green: $1 trillion for green initiatives that support climate action, with the goal of accelerating the deployment of solutions for cleaner sources of energy and facilitating the transition to a low-carbon economy. Since 2016, the firm has facilitated and financed nearly $210 billion towards green initiatives. To help clients navigate the challenges and the long-term benefits of this transition, the firm will continue to provide clients in the Corporate & Investment Bank and Commercial Banking with centralized access to sustainability-focused financing, research and advisory solutions through its Center for Carbon Transition. As part of its efforts, JPMorgan Chase Commercial Banking also recently launched a Green Economy specialized industry team. The team will initially focus on four sectors: Renewable Energy, Efficiency Technology, Sustainable Finance, and Agriculture and Food Technology.

As part of its efforts, JPMorgan Chase Commercial Banking also recently launched a Green Economy specialized industry team. The team will initially focus on four sectors: Renewable Energy, Efficiency Technology, Sustainable Finance, and Agriculture and Food Technology. Development Finance: The firm will finance and facilitate transactions that support socioeconomic development and quality of life in developing countries. By originating and structuring transactions with anticipated development impact, the firm will mobilize capital to advance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in emerging economies. Community Development: JPMorgan Chase will advance economic inclusion in developed markets. The firm will focus its efforts on small business financing, home lending and affordable housing, education and healthcare. This includes the firm’s recent $30 billion commitment to advance racial equity. “We believe that a contribution at this scale will have a significantly positive impact. As a company we commit to dedicating extensive time, expertise and focus to ongoing analysis and development of the role we play,” said Ashley Bacon, Chief Risk Officer, JPMorgan Chase. “It is necessary, but not sufficient that as financial institutions covering the whole economy, we play our part. We hope broader developments ranging from public policy to technological advancement will move us further towards a sustainable path.” Impact of Annual 2020 Target In 2020, JPMorgan Chase exceeded its annual sustainable development target and facilitated more than $220 billion in transactions, including more than $55 billion towards green initiatives. Examples include: Raising $230 million for Bloom Energy Corporation, which develops efficient energy generators used to dramatically reduce electricity costs and greenhouse gas emissions. Providing financing to support the development of ALLETE Clean Energy’s largest wind farm, which produces enough renewable energy to power about 114,000 homes; Helping structure the inaugural $198 million local currency tranche of the Republic of Uzbekistan’s sovereign issuance. Intended use of proceeds includes building 15 schools, constructing three health institutions, developing new transportation and utility infrastructure and funding social welfare programs to support women and children; and Committing $24.7 million in equity to the new construction of Old Colony, a 115-unit public housing project in South Boston. All the units will serve families at or below 60% of the Area Median Income (AMI), with 12 of the units reserved for families at or below 30% of the AMI. The new 10-year goal leverages the firm’s global reach, capital, data and resources across lines of business. The firm will look for opportunities to refine JPMorgan Chase’s methodology, just as it has done between its 2020 achievement and this new 10-year target. Our Approach to Measurement and Reporting JPMorgan Chase will share additional information about eligible business activity, how it measures qualified transactions and the results of its efforts. The firm’s 2020 ESG Report, which will be released in May 2021, will include more information on the firm’s 2020 effort. Additional detail will also be shared at that time that lays out criteria for eligible business activity that will count toward the new 10-year target, as well as the process for reviewing qualified transactions. Going forward, the firm intends to provide updates on progress in its annual ESG Report. Examples of eligible business activities may include financing efforts that support renewable energy, clean technology, waste management, conservation, green buildings, sustainable transportation, transactions that advance the United Nations SDGs, affordable housing and small business financing in low-to-moderate income communities.

{"symbol": "JPM", "publishedDate": "2021-04-26 09:33:00", "publisher": "Business Wire", "title": "JPMorgan Chase Expands Second Chance Hiring Efforts in Columbus", "image": "https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/jpmorgan-chase-expands-second-chance-hiring-efforts-in-columbus-20210426.jpg", "site": "businesswire.com", "text": "COLUMBUS, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)--JPMorgan Chase announced today it is launching a community-based hiring model in Columbus to help remove barriers for qualified people with criminal backgrounds to secure employment at JPMorgan Chase. The firm also joined a group of 29 major employers and national organizations to launch the Second Chance Business Coalition (SCBC) as part of its commitment to give people with criminal backgrounds a second chance by supporting their reentry into the workforce, community and local economies. Based on lessons learned from its efforts in Chicago, JPMorgan Chase is launching new collaborations with Columbus-based non-profit organizations to further build an inclusive hiring pipeline for people with criminal backgrounds in the city, whose histories fit within industry regulatory guidelines. The firm is collaborating with Center for Employment Opportunities (CEO), Goodwill Columbus, Columbus Urban League and The Legal Aid Society of Columbus to provide these job seekers with key resources, such as legal services, job search support and mentorship. Since its launch, this firm’s proven Second Chance recruitment model has helped more people with criminal backgrounds get hired into the firm’s Chicago workforce. In Columbus, JPMorgan Chase will provide local partnering nonprofits with technical support to equip them with best-in-practice approaches to supporting jobseekers facing barriers to jobs because of their arrest or conviction histories. The organizations will collaborate with JPMorgan Chase recruiters to provide career coaching, mock interviews, resume building, skills assessments and wraparound services to help successfully recruit, hire, and retain people recruited through this effort. “Now more than ever, Central Ohio needs an economy that works for more people,” said Corrine Burger, Chief Control Officer and Columbus Location Leader for JPMorgan Chase. “Breaking down barriers to employment not only helps connect businesses with qualified workers, but also unlocks opportunity across the community and strengthens our region. When we create hiring practices and policies that give people a second chance at stable employment, we all win.” “A critical aspect of criminal justice reform is ensuring that people with past convictions have viable employment options, and pathways to economic mobility after incarceration. We are excited to join JPMorgan Chase and other partners to promote scalable inclusive hiring practices in Central Ohio,” said Christopher Walter, Chief External Affairs Officer, Center for Employment Opportunities. “JPMorgan Chase is proving that modernizing hiring practices benefits employers by providing them with access to this highly motivated, hard working and loyal workforce.” In addition, through the Second Chance Business Coalition, JPMorgan Chase will engage with other local employers committed to adopting and promoting Second Chance hiring policies by sharing best practices, insights and learnings. JPMorgan Chase’s hiring efforts in Columbus build on a range of actions the firm has taken to expand opportunities for individuals with criminal backgrounds to pursue careers within the firm, such as proactively “banning the box” on job applications and removing all questions about criminal backgrounds from job applications. As a result of these efforts, in 2020, over 2,100 people with criminal backgrounds were hired – approximately 10 percent of JPMorgan Chase’s new hires in the U.S. Many were involved in low-level crimes such as disorderly conduct, personal drug possession and DUI (driving under the influence), and are employed in jobs such as transaction processing, and lending and account servicing. Approximately 70 million Americans have a criminal record. Research shows that individuals with a conviction history often experience significant collateral consequences as a result, including barriers to employment and a lack of opportunities to advance professionally. For example, a criminal record alone can reduce the chances of a second interview by 50 percent. A Society for Human Resource Management study found that 82 percent of managers feel that the “quality of hire” for workers with criminal records is as high as or higher than that for workers without records. Policymakers and businesses increasingly recognize that providing education, skills training and employment opportunities to people with arrest or conviction histories helps reduce recidivism, increase public safety, build stronger communities and strengthen the economy. In addition to the firm’s hiring efforts in Columbus, the firm is taking several other actions to remove barriers to employment for people with criminal backgrounds: a. Public Policy Agenda: Through the JPMorgan Chase PolicyCenter, the firm has been developing and advancing sustainable, evidence-based policy solutions to help remove barriers to employment for people with criminal backgrounds. People with criminal records face economic barriers including hiring discrimination and lost job opportunities, as well as access to higher education or capital to start a business. The drag on the earning potential of tens of millions of Americans are costs not only borne by individuals, their families, and their communities, but also have large economic consequences that contribute to inequality. This disproportionately affects people of color, with Black adults being over five times more likely to be incarcerated than white adults. Examples of the firm’s work to create greater opportunity for people with records include: Reforming Industry Hiring Rules by working with the FDIC to modify Sec 19 rules for people with convictions for certain low-risk crimes to qualify for jobs in the banking industry without increasing risk to safety and soundness. Endorsing the Fair Chance Act, which was signed into federal law in December 2019 and helps qualified workers with arrest or conviction records compete for employment in federal agencies and with federal contractors. Supporting the restoration of access to Pell Grants for incarcerated individuals. Signed into federal law in 2020, this allows incarcerated individuals to pursue post-secondary education in prison, increasing employment opportunities after their release. Advancing bipartisan Clean Slate Automatic Record Clearing, including support for federal House and Senate measures, as well as state legislation to streamline the record clearing process for eligible offenses and help individuals move on from their records. In Michigan, for example, JPMorgan Chase supported a landmark bipartisan Clean Slate measure in 2020 that will automatically clear eligible records for roughly one million people across the state. Supporting the federal Driving for Opportunity Act and state measures which seek to limit driver’s license suspensions for unpaid fines and fees unrelated to driving infractions. b. Philanthropic Commitments: JPMorgan Chase is investing an additional $12.5 million to help community organizations in cities like Los Angeles, New York, Seattle, Chicago, Nashville and Delaware, connect people with criminal backgrounds with in-demand, well-paying jobs, the tools and resources they need to achieve their financial goals, and entrepreneurship training. The firm’s philanthropic commitments also include collaborations with organizations like the Financial Health Network, Cabrini Green Legal Aid, Safer Foundation, and the Center for Employment Opportunity to help provide people with arrest or conviction records with access to the resources that they need to advance their financial health, access legal advice and build in-demand skills for stable career pathways.
