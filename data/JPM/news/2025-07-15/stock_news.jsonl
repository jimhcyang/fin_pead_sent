He is not one of those investors who keeps his strategy private; Buffett has been transparent along his investment journey. We’ve identified a trio of ETFs that fit his strategy and therefore would likely receive Buffett’s stamp of approval for the average investor in July. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement?

Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Everybody wants to invest like Warren Buffett, and rightfully so. The Omaha of Nebraska has amassed a fortune of $145.3 billion as of mid-2025 since making his first investment at the ripe age of 11. Now that he&#8217;s 94 years old, Buffett has become better with age, making him one of the most successful investors who ever lived. Fortunately, Buffett has shared investment nuggets along the way from which investors can glean to build their own winning strategies, formulas that fit both their risk tolerance, financial goals and budget. While Buffett is known for investing in individual stocks, those whose business models are simple enough to understand, he is ultimately an investor who is in it for the long haul. Similarly, ETFs are designed to let investors ride the market wave without having to make frequent changes if they don&#8217;t want to. That is why we believe we&#8217;ve identified three ETFs that Buffett himself would approve of for the average investor in July. iShares U.S. Financials ETF (IYF) Considering Warren Buffett&#8217;s inaugural investment was famously in a bank—Cities Service preferred shares—and financial institutions remain a lighthouse for his investment decisions, it makes sense to begin our exploration here. Our first pick: the iShares U.S. Financials ETF (IYF). And with Buffett&#8217;s own Berkshire Hathaway counted among this ETF&#8217;s top holdings, it would likely appeal to the Oracle of Omaha. In addition to banks, IYF targets exposure to the insurance sector, playing into the hands of Buffett&#8217;s affinity for insurance, which he has called the &#8220;engine&#8221; that has powered Berkshire Hathaway&#8217;s performance for decades. The IYF ETF boasts a lineup of colossal financial institutions like JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) and Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC), offering investors access to stable banks renowned for their robust balance sheets. These titans of finance have a demonstrated history of navigating—and profiting through—evolving market cycles. This resilience can significantly benefit investors, especially when these institutions commit to enhancing shareholder value through activities like stock buybacks. Even in economic climates with elevated interest rates, banks often find an advantage, benefiting from higher loan rates for borrowers while simultaneously attracting savers with compelling yields. Investors have also been betting on the likelihood of lower interest rates, a phenomenon that could take hold as soon as July at the next Fed meeting. This optimism has benefited the iShares U.S. Financials ETF, sending the fund to revisit its 52-week high level of approximately $123 recently, offering investors an opportunity to potentially ride this wave in July. As of early July, the IYF ETF has delivered returns of 10.8%, nearly doubling the S&amp;P 500&#8217;s returns of 6.75% over the same stretch. Over the past year, this financials ETF boasts a total return of 19.5%, in line with its benchmark index, the Russell 1000 Financials 40 Act 15/22.5 Daily Capped Index (USD). With an expense ratio of 0.39%, investors won&#8217;t have to worry about having to overpay: If you invest $10,000 in IYF, you would pay approximately $39 in fees per year. Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) Next up is the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD). Not only does this ETF deliver consistent income, but one of its core components is yet another Warren Buffett favorite: Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO). The iconic beverage giant commands a 4.3% slice of the SCHD ETF, and remarkably, represents a whopping 9.7% of Berkshire Hathaway&#8217;s total portfolio. Within the SCHD ETF, Coca-Cola is joined by fellow dividend stalwarts like Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ), Altria Group (NYSE: MO) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT). These companies have built reputations for consistently returning value to shareholders through robust dividends, making them almost a guaranteed fit for Buffett&#8217;s investing playbook. Their predictable cash flows and essential products underpin a long history of rewarding shareholders, a characteristic central to Buffett&#8217;s philosophy. While Buffett&#8217;s company, Berkshire Hathaway, isn&#8217;t a dividend-paying stock itself, that certainly doesn&#8217;t mean he discounts their power. Buffett has openly championed dividend-paying stocks as a shrewd strategy for investors on the hunt for steady income. Perhaps the most convincing evidence lies in Berkshire Hathaway&#8217;s top holding—Coca-Cola—a stock that diligently pays a dividend, which Buffett has no intentions of selling anytime soon. Its global brand power and consistent profitability make it a perpetual cash cow for Berkshire&#8217;s coffers. In early 2025, Coca-Cola announced its 63rd straight annual dividend hike, lifting its quarterly payout by 5.2% to $0.51 per share. Considering Buffett owns approximately 400 million shares of Coca-Cola stock, his company is effectively raking in over $800 million each year in dividend checks. Coca-Cola stock is also up 14.5% year-to-date, offering investors the added bonus of capital appreciation alongside their income. As for the broader Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF, it meticulously tracks the total return of the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index. With an incredibly modest expense ratio of just 0.060%, the SCHD ETF boasts over 100 holdings, granting shareholders a strong degree of diversification for protection. The fund’s underlying strategy prioritizes quality over quantity, avoiding risky high-yielding dividend stocks. Instead, it favors companies with long, proven track records of reliable payouts, offering investors a more reliable income stream and reduced volatility. This disciplined approach means even when the fund&#8217;s overall value experiences a dip, as it appears to have done in this wild 2025, investors still receive the benefit of earning consistent income through dividend distributions—which, Buffett seems to agree, is the ultimate icing on the cake for dividend stock investors anyway. Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) The Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) is a popular ETF known for its exposure to some high-flying technology stocks, including Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) and Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN). In fact, most of its top-10 holdings are technology stocks, with the exception of Costco Wholesale (Nasdaq: COST). While Warren Buffett isn&#8217;t known for his technology prowess, favoring instead businesses with more simple models, he has warmed up to the technology sector in recent years. Today, Apple and Amazon comprise 21.7% and 0.8% of Berkshire Hathaway&#8217;s portfolio, respectively. Apple is one of only a handful of Buffett&#8217;s technology stocks, which he began adding nearly a decade ago. The billionaire investor dove in head first with a $1 billion investment, making the iPhone maker one of the top holdings of Berkshire&#8217;s portfolio. Today Apple remains a key holding, with Berkshire&#8217;s investment worth over $64 billion. Buffett also bemoaned his hesitancy to add Amazon stock sooner than he did, kicking himself for for being &#8220;too dumb.&#8221; But he won&#8217;t make that mistake twice, and his AMZN holdings are now worth $2.2 billion in the Berkshire portfolio. Given their high-growth nature, the companies that make up the QQQ ETF are heavy capex spenders. While this strategy comes with an inherent amount of risk, which is the first group to be punished in challenging economic environments, the payoff can be equally as rewarding. And when it comes to capital appreciation, QQQ doesn&#8217;t disappoint. The QQQ ETF has delivered impressive long-term returns, outshining the S&amp;P 500 in seven out of the past 10 years. Investors who directed $10,000 invested in Invesco QQQ in 2020 would have seen their investment balloon to approximately $22,976 today. So far in 2025, QQQ posted a strong year-to-date gain of approximately 8%; at this pace, it will replicate last year&#8217;s returns of approximately 16%. Investors also receive a rather efficient expense ratio of just 0.20%, making it a cost-effective investment vehicle for access to Big Tech stocks, among other sector leaders. Investors with an appetite for risk and growth might find the QQQ appealing while also seizing the opportunity to hold a couple of Warren Buffett favorites.The post Here Are 3 ETFs Warren Buffett Would Approve Of for the Average Investor appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..", "url": "https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/07/07/here-are-3-etfs-warren-buffett-would-approve-of-for-the-average-investor-2/", "ticker": "JPM", "event_date": "2025-07-15", "window_start": "2025-07-01", "window_end": "2025-07-29", "publishedDateET": "2025-07-09T10:00:11-04:00", "date_et": "2025-07-09"}

The Business Development Company sector has filled the debt financing gap for small and medium sized businesses abandoned by the large banks after 2008. Due to BDC registration requirements for capital markets access, shareholders receive 90% of BDC profits, often resulting in double digit annual yields. It’s hard to believe, but today there are credit cards offering up to 6% cash back, $200 statement credits, $0 annual fees, travel rewards, and more. See for yourself, I couldn’t believe it at first. Frankly, with rewards this good we don’t expect them to be available forever. But if you sign up today you can secure some of the best rewards we’ve ever seen. Click here to get started. Prior to 2008, some of the more popular US banking institutions included: Lehman Brothers Bear Stearns Wachovia Bank Washington Mutual Merrill-Lynch IndyMac As depicted in the 2015 movie, The Long Short, the unsustainable subprime mortgage bubble wound up causing a banking industry meltdown. All of the banks in the list above despite decades of successful operations, were caught flatfooted and insolvent when the crash hit. The federal government was forced to trigger TARP (Troubled Asset Relief Program) which helped to shore up the balance sheets of the largest institutions. The leftover banks were steered towards the TARP recipients for acquisition, with Bear Stearns most notably being acquired by JP Morgan Chase at a fire-sale price of $2 per share. Unsurprisingly, turning around operations to remove red ink from balance sheets became the imperative of all of these new consolidated banks. For example, Brian Moynihan of Bank of America, which acquired Merrill-Lynch, issued a directive for brokers to close out accounts smaller than $200,000. An unforeseen casualty of the bank consolidations were the small and medium sized businesses that had been relying on the Washington Mutuals, et al. for their revolving credit lines, their inventory finance, and a panoply of other debt finance services. With millions of medium and small businesses suddenly stuck without financing options, Business Development Companies (BDCs) emerged to fill the gap, which has subsequently created a sizable standalone BDC category estimated to be over $350 billion and part of the larger $1.8 trillion private credit sector. As BDCs are registered with the SEC, they are treated comparably to REITs and thus, shareholders receive 90% of BDC profits. The five BDC examples below give a good example of the demand strength in the sector and the boost to entrepreneurship and business creation and the yields each offers investors. WhiteHorse Finance, Inc. WhiteHorse Finance has provided over $2.78 billion worth of financings since 2012, with a partiality to software companies. WhiteHorse Finance, Inc. (NASDAQ: WHF) Yield: 17.66% WhiteHorse Finance, Inc. is a Business Development Company that finances lower and mid-tier companies with growth capital in the form of senior secured notes or first lien notes. Headquartered in Miami, FL, WhiteHorse typically originates its debt underwritings in the $25 million to $50 million range for US companies in the $50 million to $350 million enterprise value category. It has deployed its $642 million portfolio to finance $2.78 billion across 260 transactions since going public in 2012. Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc. Investment banking behemoth Goldman Sachs has a BDC industry presence under its own moniker. Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc.(NYSE: GSBD) Yield: 14.13% The lucrative profits that well financed firms can avail themselves of in the BDC space have caused some of the aforementioned larger banks to get a foothold into it as well, after abandoning it years ago. Goldman Sachs is one of them. MSNBC’s Jim Cramer described Goldman Sachs recently as a firm with “a thirst that can’t be slaked without more deals.” Journalist Matt Taibbi dubbed Goldman Sachs, the prestigious (some would say nefarious) investment bank with the nickname, “Great Vampire Squid” due to it being “wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money” and its omnipresent shadow on any financial platform where money can be made. The self-descriptive Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc. represents the Goldman Sachs BDC footprint. Stellus Capital Investment Corporation Orthotics producer Dr. Scholl&#8217;s is one of Stellus Capital Management&#8217;s 350+ financing clients. Stellus Capital Investment Corporation (NYSE: SCM) Yield: 11.47% Participating in both the private corporate debt and equity markets, Houston, TX headquartered Stellus Capital Investment Corp. finances deals for American and Canadian companies with EBITDA between $5 million and $50 million. With a $3.4 billion AUM warchest, Stellus has invested over $9.8 billion across 350+ investments since beginning over 20 years ago. The company currently has over 100 financings currently active. Carlyle Secured Lending, Inc. Carlyle Secured Lending is the BDC arm of Carlyle Group, best known for its financings in the aerospace and defense industries. Stock: Carlyle Secured Lending, Inc. (NASDAQ: CGBD) Yield: 12.93% Best known for its involvement with its aerospace and defense industry investments, NY based Carlyle Group has stakes in a number of other financial platforms. With a multi billion portfolio, Carlyle Secured Lending, Inc. is Carlyle Group’s entry into the BDC arena. Golub Capital BDC Inc. Small businesses and private credit financings that might be too small for most BDCs make up a sizable portion of Golub Capital&#8217;s clientele, and have helped it to earn its numerous awards. Golub Capital BDC Inc. (NASDAQ: GBDC) Yield: 10.65% Golub Capital BDC Inc. has an unbroken award winning decade-long streak in process, with its 2024 Lender of the Year win.

Shares of MP Materials (MP) surged 50% in Thursday morning after the rare earths miner announced a multibillion-dollar agreement with the Department of Defense. The DoD is set to become MP Materials' largest shareholder at 15% following an initial $400 million purchase of a new class of \"preferred stock convertible into shares of the Company's common stock, and a warrant permitting DoD to purchase additional shares of the Company's common stock.\" MP Materials will use the government investment, along with a $1 billion funding line from JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) to fund the construction of its second domestic magnet manufacturing facility at a yet-to-be-decided location. The company also agreed to a 10-year deal with the DoD establishing the government as a long-term customer of MP's rare earths with a price floor of $110 per kilogram. The Trump administration has stated that becoming less dependent on other nations like China for rare earths—metals used in production of a variety of commercial and military products—is a top priority and national security concern. Shares of MP and USA Rare Earth (USAR) have been boosted this year by that commitment. MP Materials hit their highest price since April 2022 on Thursday morning, while USA Rare Earth shares were up nearly 14% shortly after markets opened.

Bank Stocks Continue Trending Down 12:06 pm by Eric Bleeker It&#8217;s now a little past noon, and there&#8217;s been no turnaround for either Wells Fargo or BlackRock. Wells Fargo is trading down about 5.5%, which is its daily low point. BlackRock has bounced back from its 11 a.m. lows, but is still down 5.7% on the day. Why is Wells Fargo Down? 11:09 am by Eric Bleeker Wells Fargo beat estimates but its shares are down about 5% in early trading. Let&#8217;s look at some reasons the stock is down despite this earnings beat: The company lowered expectations for its net interest income. Previously the company had guided to 1 to 3% growth in 2025, but now says it expects interest income to be &#8220;roughly in line&#8221; with 2024. The stock has also performed strongly in 2025. Shares were up more than 18% headed into today, so taking a breather isn&#8217;t unusual. We&#8217;ll continue monitoring what Wall Street has to say about Wells Fargo as the day progresses. BLK slid about 0.45% around 10:41 AM as volume spiked over 170% in that minute. 11:00 am by Eric Bleeker BlackRock just saw a significant volume spike at 10:41 a.m. ET. Its slide has accelerated since and the stock is now down 6.9% as of 11:01 a.m. ET. Major Outflow Weights on BlackRock Stock 10:32 am by Eric Bleeker Like Wells Fargo, BlackRock also reported solid earnings but is seeing its stock drop in early trading. One area that investors are watching is the company noting a $52 billion outflow from a major client. This led to a significant reduction in quarterly inflows (dropping the total down to $68 billion) and could be weighing on the stock this morning despite its solid EPS beat. Earnings season kicked off this morning with a group of powerful financial companies. Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC), and BlackRock (NYSE: BLK) each reported earnings before the bell. As of 10:00 a.m., both stocks were down. Wells Fargo: Down 4.5% BlackRock: Down 6.4% The morning has generally been unkind to stocks in the financial space. JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM) also reported earnings and is down about .6%. Citigroup (NYSE: C) is the lone bright spot in the financial space this morning, up 1.4%. We&#8217;ve compiled the main need-to-know information about each company&#8217;s earnings below and will be updating this live article with earnings analysis throughout the morning.

Q2 Earnings Expectations Here are the key figures Wall Street is expecting when Morgan Stanley&#8217;s earnings release: Revenue: $16.02 billion EPS (Normalized): $1.98 Book Value/Share: $61.38 Net Income (GAAP): $3.14 Billion Key Areas to That Could Drive Today&#8217;s Performance What areas will determine whether Morgan Stanley&#8217;s stock rises or falls after today&#8217;s earnings release and conference call (scheduled for 8:30 a.m. ET). Wealth Management Margins: Last quarter normalized pre-tax margins for Wealth Management came in below their target (30 to 32%). With net interest income (NII) on the decline and exepnse pressures, any continued margin pressure in this unit could cause Morgan Stanley&#8217;s stock to sell off today. How Significant is NII Pressure: Wells Fargo shares fell yesterday on NII pressure and Morgan Stanley came in below many peers last quarter. If the company sees NII continue to trend down, it could be the primary area Wall Street focuses on today. Investment Banking Rebound: Investment banking was a bright spot in the first quarter. If Morgan Stanley speaks bullishly about its pipeline headed into the second half of the year and 2026, that could be a share price catalyst today.

NII Projected to $15.5B to $15.7B by Q4 7:25 am by Eric Bleeker This banking earnings season has been dominated by how banks are guiding net interest income, and Bank of America guided to $15.5B to $15.7B in Q4. That will likely be a number that analysts focus on in the company&#8217;s conference call which starts shortly.

Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) is reporting earnings this morning and we&#8217;ll be updating this article with live analysis once results hit. Yesterday, companies like Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) and BlackRock (NYSE: BLK) reported earnings that broadly beat expectations, but still saw their shares fall. One reason for the drops: financial stocks have generally seen a strong 2025 year-to-date. Wells Fargo was up more than 18% headed into earnings, so poor interest income guidance was enough to sink the stock. Bank of America has lagged many of its peers, with &#8216;just&#8217; a 4% return year-to-date. So, the stock may be able to see stronger performance if its results top Wall Street expectations. What Wall Street Expects When Bank of America Reports Here are the key figures to watch when Bank of America reports shortly: Revenue: $26.73 billion EPS (Normalized): $.86 Net Income (GAAP): $6.51 billion Book Value/Share: $36.85 3 Key Areas to Watch in Bank of America&#8217;s Conference Call Bank of America is hosting its conference call at 8 a.m. ET. Here are some key areas Wall Street will be watching: Net Interest Income Pressure: Wells Fargo&#8217;s shares fell today on NII pressure. It&#8217;s likely that Wall Street will be zeroed in on how much lower short-term rates could impact Bank of America&#8217;s net interest in the second half of the year. Revenue Growth and Expense Management: With sluggish growth projected in 2025, Bank of America can continue to grow profitability by keeping expense management in check and growing operating leverage. Investment Banking Trends: Bank of America saw stronger investment banking business last quarter. Was the bounce temporary or the beginning of sustained growth in the division?

Here’s the Smartest Way to Turn It Into Monthly Passive Income", "image": "https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/inherited-400000-heres-the-smartest-way-to-turn-it-20250717.jpg", "site": "https://247wallst.com", "text": "Key Points The SPHD and DIVO ETFs are ideal vehicles for volatility mitigation and reliable income. Furthermore, you can enhance your monthly income potential with single-stock ETFs. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) If you&#8217;re fortunate enough to inherit $400,000, it may be tempting to spend that money on cars and vacations. However, the smart-money move is to invest the funds wisely and plan for your financial future. One approach is to invest that $400,000 in exchange traded funds (ETFs) that provide passive income every month. That way, you can reinvest the cash distributions and take advantage of the compounding effect. So now, it&#8217;s time to reveal four funds that unlock monthly income opportunities so you can turn your inheritance into a cash-producing machine. SPHD: A Reliable Pick for Low Volatility $400,000 is a whole lot of money to inherit and invest. Therefore, your first priority shouldn&#8217;t be maximizing your monthly dividends. Instead, it should be mitigating your risk so you don&#8217;t lose all of that money. When safety and reliability are your top priorities, the Invesco S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility ETF (NYSEARCA:SPHD) is a solid pick. This fund has 52 stocks in its holdings, all carefully selected from the S&amp;P 500 large-cap stock index. The SPHD ETF specifically chooses stocks &#8220;that historically have provided high dividend yields and low volatility.&#8221; Examples include Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), Realty Income Corp. (NYSE:O), Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), and Altria Group (NYSE:MO). These companies are known for providing consistent dividend payments, and their stocks typically aren&#8217;t volatile. Furthermore, the Invesco S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility ETF features a 12-month distribution rate (i.e., a forward annual dividend yield) of 3.44%. Plus, the SPHD ETF pays out its distributions on a monthly basis. With all of that in mind, you could take $150,000 of your inherited $400,000, put it into the Invesco S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility ETF, and sleep soundly at night. Stay in the Safe Lane With DIVO With $400,000 to invest, you&#8217;ll have a large account and there&#8217;s no need to drive in the fast lane. Instead, you can stay in the &#8220;safe lane&#8221; but still get a passive income stream with the Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF (NYSEARCA:DIVO). Much like the SPHD ETF, the Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF seeks to reduce share-price volatility while providing exposure to high-quality dividend-paying companies. Moreover, like the other funds mentioned today, DIVO puts cash distributions into your account on a monthly basis. The Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF has 24 stocks in its holdings, and you&#8217;ll see plenty of large-cap sector leaders in there. Among the top holdings in the DIVO ETF are Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), RTX/Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), Visa (NYSE:V), and Home Depot (NYSE:HD). Again, we&#8217;re choosing safety first and then aiming for good yield. Since the Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF invests in great companies and features an impressive 4.73% annual distribution rate, it checks all the right boxes. Thus, it would make sense to allocate $150,000 of a $400,000 inheritance toward the DIVO ETF. Accelerate Your Yield With Single-Stock ETFs It&#8217;s wise to dedicate $300,000 of your $400,000 inheritance toward diversified low-volatility funds like SPHD and DIVO. If you do that, then you can invest the remaining $100,000 in ETFs with greater risk but also higher yields. To that end, YieldMax offers a wide variety of ETFs that each focus on a single stock instead of a diversified basket of stocks. Typically, these YieldMax ETFs derive monthly income from U.S. Treasury bonds and sophisticated options-trading strategies. One way to reduce the risk is to stick to YieldMax ETFs that focus on established large-cap companies. For example, the YieldMax AAPL Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:APLY) indirectly derives income from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock. Currently, the APLY ETF advertises an annual distribution rate of 26.99%. This fund shouldn&#8217;t be excessively risky as Apple is a reliable blue-chip business with staying power. So, you could invest $25,000 of your $400,000 inheritance in the YieldMax AAPL Option Income Strategy ETF. A reasonable plan would be to pick four single-stock ETFs with a focus on high-confidence companies. Then, you could allocate $25,000 toward each of the four funds you picked. A Mixed-Risk Approach APLY is just one example of many monthly-paying single-stock ETFs you can choose from. Here&#8217;s a summary of other funds in this category, and while you explore them, you might think about picking your four favorites: The YieldMax AMZN Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:AMZY); based on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock; 47.82% annual distribution rate The YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:NVDY); based on NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock; 74.99% annual distribution rate The YieldMax GOOGL Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:GOOY); based on the stock of Google parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL); 32.9% annual distribution rate The YieldMax MSFT Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:MSFO); based on Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock; 34.9% annual distribution rate The YieldMax JPM Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:JPMO); based on JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) stock; 39% annual distribution rate The YieldMax AMD Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:AMDY); based on Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock; 68.07% annual distribution rate The YieldMax DIS Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:DISO); based on Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) stock; 38.55% annual distribution rate The YieldMax XOM Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:XOMO); based on Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) stock; 38.04% annual distribution rate Just to provide an idea of what your overall plan might look like, you could invest $150,000 in SPHD, $150,000 in DIVO, and $25,000 each in APLY, MSFO, DISO, and XOMO. All in all, you can mix low-risk ETFs with a handful of higher-risk ETFs to turn your inherited $400,000 into a fairly reliable monthly income-producing machine.The post Inherited $400,000?

Smaller allocations into SCHD, JEPQ, and FDVV will help you build a low-fee passive income foundation. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) How far can $25,000 get you? If you have a well-considered plan in place, you can actually turn your small account into a passive income factory. This can be done with a carefully selected group of high-yield, low-fee exchange traded funds (ETFs). With just $25,000, you can build a super-low-cost portfolio that consistently pays you cash dividends/distributions. Plus, you can de-risk your portfolio through multi-sector diversification and investment in famous large-cap companies. So, let&#8217;s start right now with a smart-money plan to extract sizable cash payouts from a small but growing account. Start With RSPA for Extra Diversification Out of a $25,000 account, you can confidently put $10,000 into just one ETF. That&#8217;s because the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF (NYSEARCA:RSPA) checks all of the right boxes for a small-sized high-growth portfolio. To populate a small-sized portfolio, I would want to use funds that invest in successful, blue-chip business. I would also insist that the ETFs should be diversified and need to have annual operating expenses below 0.5%. With a focus on companies in the prestigious S&amp;P 500 index, the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF has 525 stocks in its holdings. Suffice it to say, then, that the RSPA ETF is widely diversified. When you examine the fund&#8217;s holdings list, you&#8217;ll find established large-cap leaders across multiple economic sectors. Some examples are Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), and Consolidated Edison (NYSE:ED). An interesting feature of the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF is that each of the holdings has a small, roughly equal weighing to the other stocks in the fund. That way, you won&#8217;t over-invest in any single stock. In addition, the RSPA ETF is low-cost as it only deducts annualized operating fees of 0.29%. And for all of you yield hunters out there, the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF currently features a 12-month distribution rate of 9.42%. All in all, this ultra-diversified fund is ideal for a $25,000 account and I would feel comfortable dedicating $10,000 toward RSPA. Expand Your Portfolio With SCHD and JEPQ Even though the RSPA ETF would already expose you to 500+ stocks, you still probably wouldn&#8217;t want to toss your entire $25,000 into just one fund. Consequently, we will now explore three more ETFs and, after conducting your own due diligence, you could invest $5,000 in each one of them. The first of these three intriguing funds is the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHD). This ETF tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index and has a portfolio comprising 103 stocks. Again, we&#8217;re looking for famous large-cap names and multi-sector diversification. The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF meets these expectations with recognizable stocks like Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Merck (NYSE:MRK), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and Chevron (NYSE:CVX). Moreover, the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF serves up a trailing 12-month distribution yield of 3.87% but only deducts 0.06% worth of annual operating expenses. Therefore, investors should have no objections to allocating $5,000 toward the SCHD ETF. Next up is the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:JEPQ), which is centered around the technology-focused NASDAQ 100 index. This fund includes 107 stocks so you can participate in the growth of tech&#8217;s heavy hitters, such as NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Committing $5,000 of your $25,000 portfolio to the JEPQ ETF will unlock extra share-price appreciation potential from a variety of top tech firms. You&#8217;ll also get access to substantial cash distributions as the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF features an impressive 11.52% annual yield. We&#8217;re still sticking to the low-cost theme here since JEPQ only deducts operating fees of 0.35% per year. So, why not add some technology-fueled firepower to your small portfolio with the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF? Round It Out With FDVV To round out your $25,000 passive-income plan, you could assign $5,000 toward the Fidelity High Dividend ETF (NYSEARCA:FDVV). Instead of concentrating on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&amp;P 500, or NASDAQ 100, the FVDD ETF corresponds to the Fidelity High Dividend Index. Among the holdings list of the Fidelity High Dividend ETF, you&#8217;ll find large-cap superstars like Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), Visa (NYSE:V), Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG), and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). Overall, you&#8217;ll get exposure to plenty of consistent dividend deliverers with FDVV. The other need-to-know stats are that the Fidelity High Dividend ETF offers a trailing 12-month distribution yield of 3.07% but only deducts 0.16% in annualized operating expenses. With all of those benefits in mind, you can proudly add $5,000 worth of FDVV shares to your $25,000 account. Now, you&#8217;ve got a four-pack of funds with RSPA as your anchor as well as SCHD, JEPQ, and FDVV for extra diversification. That&#8217;s a savvy plan to keep the fees to a minimum while turning your $25,000 account into a low-risk regular income producer.The post How to Build a Super Low Cost Passive Income Fund for Only $25,000 appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..", "url": "https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/07/23/how-to-build-a-super-low-cost-passive-income-fund-for-only-25000/", "ticker": "JPM", "event_date": "2025-07-15", "window_start": "2025-07-01", "window_end": "2025-07-29", "publishedDateET": "2025-07-23T16:10:37-04:00", "date_et": "2025-07-23"}

Since hitting its 2025 low on April 4, the stock is up nearly 40%. When the company reported Q2 earnings earlier in July, it announced mixed results with EPS of 89 cents versus analysts&#8217; expectations of 86 cents, and revenues of $26.61 billion versus expectations of $26.72 billion. It was the only major U.S. bank to fall short on revenue for the quarter. Since its Depression-era roots in San Francisco, Bank of America has weathered close to a century of wars and financial upheavals to rise as one of the top financial institutions in the US, ranking #2 behind JP Morgan Chase by asset size. Bank of America’s massive AUM heft made it a $45 billion “too big to fail” TARP bailout recipient during the 2008 subprime banking meltdown. It also acquired Wall Street investment banking stalwart Merrill-Lynch as a kicker. CEO Brian Moynihan has ruthlessly slashed operations to focus on growing assets under management with lower overhead. 24/7 Wall St. has analyzed the stock, industry, sector and the macro environment to forecast where shares of Bank of America could be heading over the next five years. Bank of American (BAC) Recent Stock Success After reaching its five-year high of $49.18 per share in January 2022, Bank of America has struggled to attain that level again. Efforts to climb higher had been thwarted, but after bottoming in late October 2023, the stock has rallied back gaining nearly 84% by the end of January 2025. Regardless, investors are much more concerned with future stock&#8217;s performance over the next one, five and 10 years. While most Wall Street analysts will calculate 12-month forward projections, it’s clear that nobody has a consistent crystal ball, and plenty of unforeseen circumstances can render even near-term projections irrelevant. 24/7 Wall St. aims to present some farther-looking insights based on Bank of America’s own numbers, along with business and market development information that may be of help to our readers’ own research.

Interest Sensitive Balance Sheet: The Federal Reserve&#8217;s Fed Funds rate hikes have boosted BAC&#8217;s net interest income (NII), but negatively impacted the stock price. Rate cuts might temporarily help lending and mortgage finance, but any renewed inflation signs will be red flags and could trigger further problems. 2. Net Interest Income: The rise in NII due to higher interest rates and corresponding robust loan interest rate growth has been a critical factor for that segment, but at the cost of higher default rates and lower transaction volumes. 3. Branch Growth: Expanding financial centers and branches into currently untapped demographic markets is a part of Bank of America’s “local” growth strategy. Its Branch Expansion agenda aims to have a presence in every state. The physical presence results in a 100% increase in digital sales, and looks to expand its 3,800 branches. 4. Technology: Improved digital offerings and the use of AI and other customer service tools, can boost customer satisfaction and fees that could boost earnings. 5. Capital Deployment Strategies: Bank of America&#8217;s dividend increases and share repurchase plans reflect a strong capital position, attractive to dividend hawk-oriented investors.
