You should also balance rewards and examine your credit health. Start by selecting a card with a strong rewards program in your purchase category and then pre-qualify to avoid hard inquiries, ensuring approval odds match your FICO score. Preferably that will be north of 700. Next, secure a 0% APR intro offer to spread payments without interest, saving hundreds of dollars on your purchase, and then pay your bill on time. You will want to keep your credit utilization below 30% (for example, only use $1,500 on a $5,000 limit) to boost your score. Also try to stack a sign-up bonus for extra value. After you make your purchase, automate minimum payments, but then pay off your balance aggressively before the introductory period ends. This maximizes rewards, minimizes costs, and strengthens your credit. The situation This is more of an introduction to using your credit wisely, but there are really advanced options who want to make the best use of their credit availability. A Redditor on the r/CreditCards subreddit recently looked for advice on starting a two-player setup, which is where partners, spouses, or close allies coordinate their credit card usage to maximize rewards, bonuses, and financial benefits. One strategy might be to seek out the Chase Trifecta and Capital One Savor cards for their compelling options, but to also understand bonus categories as critical to unlocking their full potential. Chase Trifecta The Chase Trifecta comprises the Chase Sapphire Preferred, which has a $95 annual fee, Chase Freedom Unlimited, and Chase Freedom Flex, both of which have no fee. The represent a powerhouse for versatility. The Sapphire Preferred earns 3x points on dining and travel, with a 60,000-point sign-up bonus that is worth $750 in travel after you spend $4,000 in three months. Points transfer one-for-one to partners like United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), amplifying their value by 25% through Chase’s portal. The Freedom Unlimited adds 1.5x points on all non-bonus spending, while the Freedom Flex offers 5x on rotating quarterly categories such as groceries up to $1,500. Together, they cover broad spending options &#8212; travel, dining, and everyday costs &#8212; while pooling points for outsized redemption. The flexibility to shift points to travel or cashback cushions rising costs. For a two-player setup, one partner can wield Sapphire while the other uses Freedom cards, splitting duties to hit bonuses and diversify earnings. Capital One Savor Meanwhile, the Capital One Savor (also a $95 annual fee) shines for dining enthusiasts, offering 4% cashback on dining and entertainment. You can get $200 back on $5,000 in restaurant spend annually. Its 3% on groceries and streaming complements a food-focused lifestyle, and a $300 bonus after spending $3,000 in three months sweetens the deal. Unlike Chase’s points, Savor’s cashback is simpler, suiting those who prefer immediate rewards over travel planning. Pairing it with a no-fee card like Capital One Quicksilver (1.5% on all purchases) creates a lean duo, though it lacks Chase’s transfer flexibility. Understanding the bonus opportunity Bonus categories are the linchpin. Chase’s 5x quarterly caps demand proactive planning. If you activate them late or overspend the spending limit, you will find yourself squandering their potential. Savor’s 4% dining edge shines for restaurant buffs, but fades if your big purchase &#8212; say a $5,000 appliance &#8212; falls outside of food or entertainment, and nets just 1%. It is critical to understand your spending habits. A travel-heavy lifestyle favors Chase, while foodies should lean toward Savor. Pre-qualifying ensures approval without dinging your credit, especially vital if you have a major purchase looming. Pairing with a 0% APR card, such as Chase Slate Edge, which gives you 18 months to pay off the balance, stretches payments interest-free and saves you hundreds of dollars on hefty purchases. For sheer value and adaptability, Chase Trifecta triumphs with its point ecosystem. For dining out, though, Savor reigns supreme. But aligning categories with your actual spending habits unlocks the true payoff.

Our caller today, let&#8217;s call her &#8220;Gwen,&#8221; is a young adult fresh out of college and off to a good start with a credit score of 746 (which FICO considers &#8220;very good&#8221;), but looking for a better credit card to maximize her cash back. Gwen is rocking a Chase Freedom Student card at present, a holdover from her college days that Chase Bank actually no longer offers. The Chase Freedom Student has been phased out and replaced by a similar card that&#8217;s now called &#8220;Chase Freedom Rise.&#8221; It&#8217;s not a bad card as cashback cards go. It doesn&#8217;t charge any annual fee for example. But it only pays 1.5% cash back on purchases, which these days is really the absolute minimum you should demand in a cash back card. Long story short, Gwen can do better. Let&#8217;s help her out with that. .keypoints-box { margin-bottom: 20px; } Key Points No one credit card is best for cash back. A good cash back strategy includes a single all-around card paying 2%, supplemented by multiple cards paying more cash back for specific kinds of purchases. The Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express pays 6% cash back for gas grocery and streaming purchases, but it does charge an annual fee. The right cash back credit card can earn you hundreds, or thousands of dollars a year for free. Our top pick pays up to 5% cash back, a $200 bonus on top, and $0 annual fee. Click here to apply now (Sponsor) Ordinarily, my advice when picking cash back cards is to go for a mixed approach, holding one card that pays a decent cash back rate on all purchases in all categories, with no limit on the cash back you can earn, and no annual fee. Any of several major branded credit cards fit this bill, including The Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) Active Cash card, Citi (NYSE: C) Double Cash, and SoFi&#8216;s (Nasdaq: SOFI) Unlimited 2% credit card. This all-around &#8220;good enough&#8221; card should then be paired with a handful of other cards that pay less than 2% for what Gwen might call &#8220;etc&#8221; purchases, but more than 2% for specific categories of purchases where she spends heavily. Whenever making one of these specific purchases, Gwen would switch out her good-enough card, and use one of these credit cards tailored to the specific purchase she&#8217;s making, be it gas, or groceries, or restaurants for example. Good options for this part of the package might include Bank of America&#8216;s (NYSE: BAC) Customized Cash card, which lets a cardholder pick one category of purchase to receive 3% cash back on; or Citi&#8217;s Custom Cash card, which let&#8217;s you pick a category to receive 5% cash back (albeit, only up to $500 in purchases per month). Is the Blue Cash Preferred Card a good cash back card? Gwen seems to be thinking along these same lines as well, asking specifically if she should ditch her Chase Freedom Student card in favor of the Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express (NYSE: AXP). So should she? My first instinct is to say &#8220;no&#8221; without thinking, because unlike all of the cards I&#8217;ve named above, the AmEx card charges a $95 annual fee (after the first year). But on further reflection, the Blue Cash Preferred Card idea may have some merit, especially when used in conjunction with a second, good-enough card. Why? Well, consider this: The Blue card pays a superb 6% cashback on grocery purchases, 6% more on &#8220;select&#8221; streaming subscriptions, and 3% on gas stations. It pays only 1% cashback on everything else, but Gwen already has a card that she can use for everything else, her Chase card, and it pays 1.5%. The question really comes down to this: Will Gwen spend enough on groceries and streaming, to cover the $95 annual fee, and still give her more cash back than she&#8217;d get if she used a different card (or cards) paying only 3% on groceries and streaming? It&#8217;s not too hard to answer that question, though. First, we need to know how much Gwen pays for groceries and streaming in an average month. Is it $500? If so, then at 6% cashback she&#8217;s getting $30 back a month on those purchases, or $360 a year, instead of the $15 a month, or $180 a year, she&#8217;d be getting with a 3% cash back card (or cards). The difference between $360 and $180 ($180), is more than the $95 annual fee, so Gwen is actually getting a good deal in this case. Conversely, if Gwen spends only $200 a month on groceries and streaming, her cashback at 6% is $144 a year. Minus the $95 annual fee, she&#8217;s netting only $49 cash back, which is less than the $72 she&#8217;d get on a 3% cashback card with no annual fee. In that case, she&#8217;s better off finding a different card, and leaving the AmEx card to bigger spenders.

The Nasdaq Composite is leading the charge with a 1.8% advance, followed by the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average, which are up 1.6% and 1.4%, respectively. China is apparently ready to come to the negotiating table on tariffs, infusing optimism into an otherwise confused stock market today. The Nasdaq Composite is being led by stocks like Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL), Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) and Apple Materials (Nasdaq: AMAT) today. At the current pace, the Nasdaq Composite is looking at a 7% gain for the week, giving it a year-to-date advance of about 3%. Whipsaw Trading 12:18 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The markets are seeing green as of early afternoon trading in what has been a whipsaw trading session for investors. All three of the major stock market indices are now seeing green, but there is a lack of conviction in either direction today. The Nasdaq Composite is being lifted by stocks like Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) and Linde (Nasdaq: LIN), with gains of 3% and 2%, respectively. While the latest wholesale price data shows inflation is waning, policymakers aren&#8217;t convinced. NY Fed official John Williams predicts economic growth will slow to a mere 1% in 2025, blaming tariffs for what he expects could result in 4% inflation by year-end. Stocks Flip Green 10:00 am by Gerelyn Terzo As of mid-morning trading, the stock market has turned higher, with all three of the major stock market averages now seeing green. Most sectors of the economy are now trading higher, led by materials and technology, each of which are up about 1%. The economy is still uncertain, but inflation is headed in the right direction &#8211; lower. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink warned on CNBC that a recession might have already reared its head in the U.S. economy. Here&#8217;s a look at where things stand at last check: Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 198.68 (+0.48%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 129.17 (+0.79%) S&amp;P 500: Up 24.31 (+0.40%) The markets remain fearful, falling modestly at the open across the board amid what JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has called a turbulent economy. Dimon also warned that S&amp;P 500 earnings estimates are going to be revised downward as corporate American continues to cancel their current outlooks, some of which have already begun to do so. He expects that American banks will be in the crosshairs of the trade wars. Markets are also weighing some better than expected economic data on the inflationary front. Wholesale price declined by 0.4% last month, yet another indication of waning inflation as the Federal Reserve gears up for its May meeting on interest rates. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 305.83 (-0.77%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 78.09 (-0.44%) S&amp;P 500: Down 32.54 (-0.66%) Market Movers It&#8217;s a tale of two markets for the chip stocks today. Texas Instruments (Nasdaq: TXN) is falling a steep 8.9% to about its 52-week low level. The stock was trading in the $200 area last month to currently hover at $142 per share. On the flip side, Advanced Micro Devices (Nasdaq: AMD) is gaining 4.3% today to nearly $94 per share. The stock was well over $100 per share in recent weeks and has been volatile.

If the gains hold, the S&amp;P 500 is on pace for a 5.4% gain this week after taking investors on a roller coaster ride. China is looking ready to negotiate on tariffs, filling in the missing piece of the tariff puzzle that has kept things interesting this week.

It&#8217;s been a topsy turvy trading session as the markets process improving inflation data, faltering consumer confidence and fears of a recession. Fed Official John Williams is stoking fears of inflation rearing its head to the tune of 4% by year-end 2025, pointing to the tariffs as the negative catalyst.

The company also declared a $0.44 dividend, up from $0.39 previously, alongside its Q1 results. Roller Coaster Ride 10:30 am by Gerelyn Terzo The markets remain under pressure after the University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey showed weakness. Just about every sector of the economy is now in the red after a mixed showing earlier this morning. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon expects corporate America to renege on their earnings outlooks, while BlackRock CEO Larry Fink believes an economic recession is brewing. Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) reported better-than-expected Q1 profits on strong trading volumes. The markets are continuing their roller coaster ride this morning, going from red to green and then back again. This wild week on Wall Street has seen it all, as a perfect storm of trade wars, recession talk and economic uncertainty dominate the headlines. At last check, all three of the major stock market averages were under pressure while sector performance is split between winners and losers. On the economic front, wholesale prices fell more than expected last month, a welcome surprise and an indication of waning inflation. Before the markets had much of a chance to celebrate, another round of economic data swung the other way. Consumer sentiment is down in April, according to the latest University of Michigan poll, as investors lose sleep over the trade war and inflation. The hits keep coming, as JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned he expects that S&amp;P 500 earnings estimates will be changed to the downside amid a turbulent economic backdrop. Not to be outdone, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink would not be surprised if there is already a recession emerging in the economy. China has lifted its tariffs on U.S. imports to 125% as the trade war saga continues to unfold. Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) has kicked off Q1 earnings season with stronger than expected profits, buoyed by high trading volumes.

This rebound follows China&#8217;s imposition of 125% tariffs on U.S. products, contributing to persistent uncertainty after a turbulent week sparked by U.S. tariff announcements. The stock market is shrugging off the latest salvo between the U.S. and China over trade. All stock indices opened slightly higher at the morning bell, with the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO) up 0.7%. China raised its tariffs on U.S. goods to 125%, matching the rate President Trump had imposed on Chinese imports. Beijing, though, said it no longer matters what further increases the U.S. hits it with as it will not respond because &#8220;Given that, at the current tariff level, U.S. exports to China are no longer commercially viable, China will not respond to any further tariff hikes by the U.S. on Chinese goods.&#8221; With Trump having essentially eliminated the de minimis rule that Chinese marketplaces like Temu and Schein used to ship cheap goods to the U.S. duty-free, it&#8217;s not unreasonable to say trade between the U.S. and China is dead. Big names bolster market Although most components of the Vanguard ETF are down, the biggest components of the index are moving higher. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), representing the second largest position in the exchange-traded fund at over 6%, is up more than 2%, helping to drive the ETF higher. Even though top dog Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is in the red, it is almost at break-even so its impact is negligible. Yet some components are up strongly in morning trading. Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), which is the eighth largest position, is up 3.4%. The AI chipmaker&#8217;s stock has held up better than most over the tumultuous week with shares 22% higher. Banking on trading turmoil What is buoying stocks this morning are the results of bank stock earnings starting to come in with giants like JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) reported record revenue on higher trading despite caution over economic headwinds. JPM stock represents 1.5% of VOO&#8217;s portfolio, just behind 10th place Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) at 1.6%. JPMorgan is up 2% in morning trading. Other financial stocks in the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF that reported earnings today include Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), both of which had better than expected results. Yet banks were also being very cautious and were setting aside larger amounts for credit losses. It suggests they foresee tougher times coming and are preparing for the worst. JPMorgan&#8217;s provision for credit losses in the fourth quarter rose to $3.3 billion from $2.6 billion. Wells Fargo&#8217;s provision, however, was lower than expected. It set aside $932 million, less than the $1.2 billion Wall Street wass anticipating. Morgan Stanley&#8217;s credit loss provision was just $135 million, but it is markedly higher than the $6 million et aside in its year-ago first quarter.

What Are Some Good Next Steps?","It’s a real-world truth that your first credit card, especially if you get it while in high school or college, will likely be a fairly basic card. Yes, some rewards might be available, but they will be limited compared to the type of cards you can get today. .keypoints-box { margin-bottom: 20px; } Key Points Upgrading your current card is a relatively simple process, provided you have established some credit history. If you stick with your current issuer, you should be able to make an easy transition. The downside of sticking with the same bank might be losing our on bonus miles or points. The right cash back credit card can earn you hundreds, or thousands of dollars a year for free. Our top pick pays up to 5% cash back, a $200 bonus on top, and $0 annual fee. Click here to apply now (Sponsor) If you have a more basic credit card, the good news is that if you have a good payment history and are looking to get yourself something that can offer you more travel benefits, you should absolutely take that step. You could easily be on your way to more travel rewards. What To Know One of the most important things to know is that you are likely to have the best luck upgrading your card to another option in your issuers current lineup. For example, if you have a more introductory Chase card, you might consider upgrading to another card in the Chase lineup that focuses more on travel. The benefit of doing so is that you can avoid having a hard credit hit on your credit card, which can temporarily lower your credit score. Most people experience this when they apply for new credit with a new bank, and it&#8217;s a definite annoyance. However, the downside might be that you don’t get to take advantage of any signing bonuses that are available. Many credit cards, especially travel cards, will offer you bonus number of miles or points if you spend a certain amount in the first 90 days. This is usually a very attractive offer, and losing it can be a shame, but you have to balance this against the hard credit inquiry. How To Upgrade Same Issuer Once you have settled on a new credit card to consider, the next step is to determine whether you want to stay with the same issuer or another issuer. Depending on the option, your next steps will be slightly different. If you stay with the same issuer, you just have to call the number on the back of your credit card and ask about upgrade options. The benefit of calling and talking to someone might be taking advantage of new card sign-up bonuses, as you might get lucky. On the plus side, if you stay with a current issuer, you might get a slightly higher credit limit if you have a good payment history. This credit history could be utilized to determine whether your issuer feels you qualify for a higher balance, which could also result in a hard inquiry. New Issuer If you don’t want to use the same issuer, it’s as simple as applying for a new card online after you settle on which card you want. The hope is that you have narrowed down whether you want a credit card that focuses on miles, hotels, or just general travel points that can be used for any type of travel. Another good reason to go with a new issuer is that many websites will let you know via a pre-approval link, something you may get in the mail or through email. This will help you know which credit card might approve you with better perks and a higher balance. There is also the bonus of using a pre-approval link as a soft credit inquiry. If you don’t get approved, you don’t have to worry about a hard hit on your credit when you try to apply for another credit card from another issuer. What To Do With Your Old Card Once you apply for and receive a new card offering better travel benefits, you must decide what to do with your old card. In most cases, you should pay off the balance and leave it alone, which translates to just throw it in a drawer. Unless you plan on applying for a mortgage, rent, car, or anything requiring a credit inquiry, you can pay off the balance and not worry about canceling the card anytime soon.

With various credit cards offering a myriad of benefits and perks, there is every reason to consider either of these card issuers when looking for something great. Key Points Shopping websites are available to both Capital One and Chase credit card holders. The Capital One site is arguably much easier to use and has more partners available. The Chase website does offer seasonal offers and strong notification alerts. The right cash back credit card can earn you hundreds, or thousands of dollars a year for free. Our top pick pays up to 5% cash back, a $200 bonus on top, and $0 annual fee. Click here to apply now (Sponsor) One Redditor explains why these two brands are so favored by pointing out that Chase and Capital One have specialized shopping websites. Both of these websites offer cardholders discounts at various retailers and the opportunity to earn even more cashback. The Concern What initially concerns this Redditor is that the variety of offers was just jarring when they logged into their Chase and Capital One shopping portals. The original poster immediately noticed that Capital One had over 100 offers while their Chase account only had 14, which was a surprising difference. To be fair, this individual is new to Chase, which is likely why they are seeing so few offers, but it’s concerning that this isn’t immediately clear to this individual as a new Chase customer. A few comments in the Reddit post immediately highlight that once you have been a Chase customer for a while, the company learns your shopping habits and will show you more offers. There is a bit of a caveat here, as the Redditor admits they were able to find more offers and discounts eventually, but they wrote the post after they only saw the initial small selection of cashback offers. As a longtime Chase cardholder, I can verify that I could log in myself and see a similar number of offers compared to Capital One, but with the same caveat that they are not easy to find. The Offers Capital One If you are not familiar with either of these portals, as the Redditor is pointing out, both Chase and Capital One offer shopping portals that anyone with a card can join. In fact, with Capital One, the shopping portal is public, but having an existing card login helps you get directly into the portal setup. Once you are logged in, it’s immediate that Capital One is focusing on getting your attention upfront with big names like up to 5% back at Walmart, 2% at Apple, 7% at Macy’s, 13% at Best Buy, and so on. The thing with Capital One and what makes it such an attractive shopping portal is that the big names continue with Target, Dick’s, Home Depot, Lowe’s, and dozens more of your favorite retailers. Chase Unlike Capital One, which is open to the public, the Chase shopping portal requires you to log in with a Chase account. Once you are in, you have a vastly different setup that makes it a lot harder to identify where your offers are. I’m very familiar with the Chase site, and finding a complete list of offers still takes several clicks. There is no question that Capital One is more user-friendly. This said, Chase offers also seem to lack the same level of big names, or at least from what is immediately apparent. You’ll still see Dell, Office Depot, Lenovo, BackCountry, and other names like Samsung, but the &#8220;star power&#8221; isn&#8217;t there as far as retailers. Still, it takes a lot more searching on the website to find these offers, which ties directly back to the original poster’s concern that Chase seems lacking. Which Is Better? In some ways, Chase has a leg up by highlighting offers for Spring Deals, which is a nice addition to its portal page. They also allow me to choose a set of favorite shopping categories like tech, home, beauty, etc. However, I still have to agree with the original poster and highlight that Capital One’s layout is far easier to navigate, but it’s also easier to pick which offers are online and which are in-store, a distinction I couldn’t find on the Chase site. This distinction makes a big difference because I saw Petco offering me up to 7% cash back with my Capital One card. I purchased dog food there, so a benefit just appeared right before me that I immediately wanted to take advantage of it. Chase is upfront about special deals, seasonal sales, and bonus offers, but everything is more difficult to navigate, making it a more frustrating shopping experience. Even if Chase were to offer a slightly higher percentage than Capital One, trying to find it might be enough of a headache that I would choose Capital One and skip the headache.

With all the different perks and benefits available today, it makes perfect sense to shop around and find who offers the best deal. Key Points This Redditor is looking for a great combination of general and travel card. Sadly, they don’t want to live in a cash-back world. There are a few really strong recommendations that are worth considering. The right travel credit card can take you to places you’ve never dreamed of. Click here now to see our top picks. (Sponsor) This is precisely the situation with one Redditor posting on r/CreditCards, as they are looking to find the card that best matches their goals and travel needs. This individual is looking at travel as their primary goal, so all efforts here will be about earning miles and points. It’s a little confusing that the Redditor wants a card that excels for both general and travel purposes, as most cards do one or the other really well, but there is no harm in trying to find something that works. The Criteria With an income of over $300,000 and a FICO score of 800, this Redditor hopes to get a solid travel card that allows them to use points for domestic and international travel. Currently, they are okay with category-specific cards but do not favor rotating-category cards, which knocks some of the more popular cashback cards off the board. While they only travel once per year, either domestically or internationally, they have an international trip already planned, so it would be ideal to have a card they could use to rack up some points this year. As far as expenses, they have their once-yearly travel plans, a $5,000 monthly mortgage, a $500 HOA, and $350 in monthly utilities, none of which are paid by card. There is also a Costco membership, but this really isn’t a factor, and they already have a Costco Citi Visa, BoA unlimited cash rewards, BoA customized cash rewards, and a Discover card. So, after considering the AMEX Platinum and Bilt cards, they are still waiting to find something better. However, it’s worth noting that in the comments, they clarify that they are okay with an annual fee and the option to downgrade if they find themselves traveling less. The Options AMEX Platinum Among the top recommended options is a card that the original poster is already considering. The American Express Platinum card has a $695 annual fee, which is a definite negative, but it also has many bonuses to help offset this charge. However, before getting into the benefits, it&#8217;s worth knowing that the attractive 80,000 membership reward point bonus requires $8,000 in eligible purchases over 6 months. While we don’t know precisely what the Redditor spends monthly, this should be manageable based on their overall income and general spending habits. With this card, you get a $155 Walmart+ credit, a $200 hotel credit every year, a $240 digital entertainment credit, and a $200 airline fee credit, which means the $695 annual fee is offset by $900 in value when you also get a $15 Uber Cash credit every month. Capital One Venture X Another solid option for this Redditor might be the Capital One Venture X card. While it has a $395 annual fee, it offers a $300 annual travel credit, a $120 Global Entry or TSA PreCheck credit, 10,000 bonus miles (equivalent to $100) every year, and 75,000 bonus miles after you spend $4,000 in the first three months. Earning 10X miles on hotel and car rentals, 5X miles on flights, and 2X miles on all other purchases, this Redditor should have more than enough time to spend and save for their once-yearly big trip. Plus, you get access to more than 1,300 lounges, which could be beneficial if and when the original poster goes international and wants a nicer place to sit and wait for their flight. Chase Sapphire Preferred Among Chase’s best cards, this one offers an outstanding balance between general and travel spending, making it a top option. The Chase Sapphire Preferred has a $95 annual fee but offers 100,000 bonus points with just $5,000 in spending after 90 days, a pretty strong bonus overall. In addition, you get $200 in partner value from Chase partners, $50 statement credits every year when booking through Chase Travel, and 25% more value when rewards are redeemed for travel. To earn rewards, you can earn 2X on all travel purchases, 3X on dining out or taking in, 3X points on grocery purchases, and 3X on streaming services, so rewards can quickly add up.
