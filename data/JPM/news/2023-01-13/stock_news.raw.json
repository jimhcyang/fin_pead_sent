    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The majority of small and midsize U.S. business leaders anticipate a recession in 2023, according to JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 annual Business Leaders Outlook survey released today. In total, 65% of midsize businesses and 61% of small businesses expect a recession in the year ahead. The heightened recession expectations come as businesses nationwide continue to combat inflation. Nearly all midsize businesses (91%) are experiencing inflation challenges, while 45% of small businesses list inflation as a top challenge for the year ahead, up from 20% one year ago. Inflation has forced small and midsize businesses to re-evaluate approaches to pricing, sourcing materials and running operations and has had widespread impacts, including: Passing Costs onto Consumers: 83% of midsize businesses have passed at least some increased costs onto consumers and buyers, while 68% of small businesses have raised prices on select or all products and services. Rising Business Expenses: 94% of small businesses say inflation has impacted expenses, with 38% noting that expenses have increased by 11% or more. Leading cost drivers for both small and midsize businesses include wages and benefits costs for hiring and retaining employees, shipping and other supply chain-related expenditures, including costs of raw materials. Bracing for Longer-Term Increases: 82% of midsize businesses are likely to continue to increase prices to mitigate costs, while the majority of small businesses expect that higher costs for labor, rents, shipping and materials are here to stay. “Inflation has been a challenging headwind impacting businesses of all sizes, across all industries,” said Ginger Chambless, head of research, JPMorgan Chase Commercial Banking. “While we have seen some encouraging signs that inflation has started to moderate and should cool over 2023, businesses may still want to consider adjustments to strategies, pricing or product mixes to help weather the storm in the near-term.” Mixed Economic Views Despite the shared consensus on a recession in 2023, small businesses remain more optimistic in their economic outlooks than midsize business leaders, who expressed much more downbeat views compared to this time last year. Midsize businesses expressing optimism for the global economy declined to 8% from 34% one year ago and the number optimistic about the national economy fell to 22% from 50% at the start of 2022. Conversely, nearly half of small businesses, which are less likely to have exposure to national and international markets, expressed optimism for the national and global economy at 49% and 45%, respectively, which is similar to last year’s sentiment. High Performance Expectations Small and midsize business leaders’ outlook for their own company’s performance remains high, with 72% of small businesses and 66% of midsize businesses expressing optimism for the year ahead. More than two-thirds (69%) of small businesses expect increased revenue and sales in the year ahead and 65% anticipate greater profits in 2023. Similarly, 63% of midsize businesses expect increased revenue and sales in 2023, and 51% predict greater profits. “Following the challenges of the last few years, it’s encouraging to see the resilience of small business owners and leaders,” said Ben Walter, CEO, Chase Business Banking. “The next economic cycle is always right around the corner, so our role is to help small business owners plan ahead so they can succeed in good times and bad.” Help Still Wanted Concerns of a recession and dimmed economic outlooks largely aren’t restraining 2023 hiring plans, as 51% of small business leaders anticipate hiring full-time employees and 50% of midsize business leaders expect to increase headcount. To hire and retain employees, 67% of midsize businesses plan to increase wages and/or benefits and 43% plan to offer upskilling and training opportunities, while 42% of small businesses expect to increase wages. Small businesses’ primary drivers for full-time hiring plans include expected sales growth and improved financial positions. “While businesses may be cautious in their economic outlooks, their actions display a focus on growth and investing in their employees,” said John Simmons, head of Middle Market Banking & Specialized Industries, JPMorgan Chase Commercial Banking. “Businesses are signaling that they’re practiced in being nimble and prepared for several different scenarios, which are keys to operating effectively in today’s economy.” New Year’s To-Do List Businesses may consider focusing on the following considerations in their 2023 planning: For more information on the Business Leaders Outlook survey, please view the midsize and small business reports. +++ Survey Methodology JPMorgan Chase’s Business Leaders Outlook survey was conducted online from November 14-22, 2022, for small businesses (annual revenues between $100,000 and $20 million) and from November 29 – December 13, 2022, for midsize businesses (annual revenues between $20 million and $500 million). In total, 1,799 business leaders in various industries across the U.S. participated in the survey. For year-over-year trends, current data is compared to data collected in the fourth quarter of previous years. The results of this online survey are within statistical parameters for validity, and the error rate is plus or minus 3.1% for the small business findings and plus or minus 3.5% for the midsize business findings, both at the 95% confidence level.

    "text": "NUEVA YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--La mayoría de los líderes de las pequeñas y medianas empresas de EE.UU. considera que habrá una recesión en 2023, según la encuesta anual Business Leaders Outlook (Perspectivas de los Directivos Empresariales) 2023 de JPMorgan Chase, publicada hoy. En total, el 65% de las empresas medianas y el 61% de las pequeñas esperan una recesión para el año próximo. Las mayores expectativas de recesión se producen cuando las empresas de todo el país continúan combatiendo la inflación. Casi todas las medianas empresas (91%) están experimentando desafíos inflacionarios, mientras que el 45% de las pequeñas empresas consideran que la inflación es el principal desafío para el año que viene, frente al 20% de hace un año. La inflación ha obligado a las pequeñas y medianas empresas a reevaluar sus métodos de fijación de precios, aprovisionamiento de materiales y gestión de las operaciones y ha tenido repercusiones generalizadas, como por ejemplo: Transferir los costos a los consumidores: El 83% de las medianas empresas han transferido por lo menos una parte del aumento de los costos a los consumidores y compradores, mientras que el 68% de las pequeñas empresas han subido los precios de algunos o todos los productos y servicios. Aumento de los gastos empresariales: El 94% de las pequeñas empresas afirman que la inflación ha afectado los gastos y el 38% señala que los gastos han aumentado un 11% o más. Los principales factores de costos, tanto para las pequeñas como para las medianas empresas, son los salarios y beneficios para contratar y retener a los empleados, el transporte y otros gastos relacionados con la cadena de suministro, en particular los costos de las materias primas. Tener que prepararse para aumentos a largo plazo: El 82% de las medianas empresas probablemente seguirán aumentando los precios para mitigar los costos, mientras que la mayoría de las pequeñas empresas esperan que el aumento de los costos de mano de obra, alquileres, envíos y materiales lleguen para quedarse. \"La inflación ha sido un viento en contra que perjudicó a las empresas de todos los tamaños y sectores\", afirma Ginger Chambless, directora de investigación de JPMorgan Chase Commercial Banking. \"Si bien hemos visto algunos signos alentadores de que la inflación ha comenzado a moderarse y debería enfriarse a lo largo de 2023, es posible que las empresas todavía tengan que evaluar la posibilidad de reajustar las estrategias, los precios o las combinaciones de productos para ayudar a capear la tormenta en el corto plazo\". Puntos de vista económicos mixtos A pesar del consenso generalizado sobre la probabilidad de que haya una recesión en 2023, las pequeñas empresas siguen siendo más optimistas en sus perspectivas económicas que los líderes de las medianas empresas, quienes expresaron opiniones mucho más pesimistas en comparación con el año pasado por estas fechas. Las empresas medianas que expresan optimismo respecto a la economía mundial descendieron al 8% desde el 34% de hace un año y el número de optimistas sobre la economía nacional cayó al 22% desde el 50% a principios de 2022. Por el contrario, casi la mitad de las pequeñas empresas, que son menos propensas a tener exposición a los mercados nacionales e internacionales, expresaron optimismo por la economía nacional y mundial en un 49% y 45%, respectivamente, es decir, cifras similares a las del sentimiento del año pasado. Expectativas de alto rendimiento Las perspectivas de los líderes de las pequeñas y medianas empresas sobre el rendimiento de su propia empresa siguen siendo altas: un 72% de las pequeñas empresas y un 66% de las medianas empresas expresan optimismo para el próximo año. Más de dos tercios (69%) de las pequeñas empresas esperan un aumento de los ingresos y las ventas en el próximo año y el 65% anticipan mayores ganancias en 2023. Del mismo modo, el 63% de las medianas empresas esperan un aumento de los ingresos y las ventas en 2023 y el 51% predice mayores beneficios. \"Luego de los desafíos de los últimos años, es alentador ver la resiliencia de los propietarios y líderes de las pequeñas empresas\", aseguró Ben Walter, gerente general de Chase Business Banking. \"El siguiente ciclo económico siempre está a la vuelta de la esquina y por eso, nuestra función es ayudar a los propietarios de las pequeñas empresas a planificar con anticipación para que puedan tener éxito en los buenos y en los malos tiempos\". Aún se busca ayuda Las preocupaciones por una recesión y las perspectivas económicas atenuadas en gran medida parecen no están restringiendo los planes de contratación de 2023, ya que el 51% de los líderes de las pequeñas empresas anticipan contratar empleados de tiempo completo y el 50% de los líderes de las medianas empresas esperan aumentar la plantilla. Para contratar y retener a los empleados, el 67% de las medianas empresas tienen previsto aumentar los salarios y/o los beneficios y el 43% tienen previsto ofrecer oportunidades de mejora de las competencias y de capacitación, mientras que el 42% de las pequeñas empresas esperan aumentar los salarios. Los principales factores que impulsan los planes de contratación de tiempo completo de las pequeñas empresas son el crecimiento previsto de las ventas y la mejora de la situación financiera. \"Si bien las perspectivas económicas de las empresas pueden ser prudentes, sus acciones demuestran que ponen el foco en el crecimiento y la inversión en sus empleados\", subrayó John Simmons, director de Banca de Mercado Medio e Industrias Especializadas, JPMorgan Chase Commercial Banking. \"Las empresas reflejan que tienen práctica en ser ágiles y estar preparadas para situaciones de lo más diversas, que son las claves para operar con eficacia en la economía actual\". Lista de tareas para el año nuevo Las empresas pueden considerar concentrarse en las siguientes consideraciones en su planificación para 2023: Para más información sobre la encuesta Business Leaders Outlook (Perspectivas de los Directivos Empresariales), consulte los informes sobre pequeñas y medianas empresas. +++ Metodología de la encuesta La encuesta Business Leaders Outlook (Perspectivas de los Directivos Empresariales) de JPMorgan Chase se realizó en Internet del 14 al 22 de noviembre de 2022 para pequeñas empresas (ingresos anuales entre 100.000 y 20 millones de dólares) y del 29 de noviembre al 13 de diciembre de 2022 para medianas empresas (ingresos anuales entre 20 y 500 millones de dólares). En total, participaron 1.799 directivos empresariales de diversos sectores de Estados Unidos. Para trazar las tendencias interanuales, los datos actuales se comparan con los reunidos en el cuarto trimestre de años anteriores. Los resultados de esta encuesta web se encuentran dentro de los parámetros estadísticos de validez y la tasa de error ronda el 3,1% para los resultados de las pequeñas empresas y el 3,5% para los resultados de las medianas empresas, ambos con un nivel de confianza del 95%.

    "text": "MUMBAI, India--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Almost all (91%) Indian midsize business leaders are expecting their revenues to rise this year, and more than 84% are anticipating their profits to also climb, according to J.P. Morgan’s inaugural India Business Leaders Outlook survey released today. “Even with concerns over rising costs and a competitive business environment, Indian midsize business leaders are strikingly confident about this year,” said Pranav Chawda, Head of Commercial Banking, India, J.P. Morgan. “The survey results help us to anticipate that India will continue on an upward trajectory as businesses explore new and advanced distribution channels internationally, along with forging strategic partnerships and looking for investment opportunities to grow.” In a survey of more than 300 senior executives from Indian midsize companies, many are confident in the global (63%) and national (68%) economy in the year ahead. Amid the notable optimism, 78% of Indian midsize business leaders are experiencing inflation challenges and rising costs for their businesses—and a large majority expect capital expenditures (76%) and capital needs (82%) to rise, and are therefore scaling their business activities accordingly. “We are happy to see that the post-pandemic progress is likely to continue in India as midsize businesses are taking the necessary steps to navigate through global recessionary pressures, high inflation, and supply chain uncertainties that will continue this year,” said Kaustubh Kulkarni, Senior Country Officer, J.P. Morgan India and Vice Chair, Asia Pacific. Establishing Positive Working Environments With optimism at the forefront, 81% of Indian midsize business leaders expect to increase or preserve their company’s headcount over the next 12 months. Of those planning to add or maintain headcount, they’re combatting the current labor environment and make hiring and retaining strong talent possible by taking some intentional measures through: Giving employees flexibility on where they work (64%) Increasing wages and benefits (60%) Offering flexible work hours (57%) Offering upskilling/training opportunities (56%) Combatting Inflation and Rising Costs In spite of the local optimism, business leaders are facing challenges and navigating obstacles. Like most businesses across the world, inflation continues to be a major hurdle for Indian businesses with nearly eight in ten (78%) experiencing increased business costs driven by supply chain issues (69%), raw materials (67%) and energy (65%). To account for inflation, Indian business leaders indicate they are watching prices more closely (53%), making changes to purchasing to reduce expenses (50%), and prioritizing the production, delivery and sale of their most profitable products (49%). Additionally, 61% are passing on up to half of their increased costs to consumers—and almost all (94%) say they will continue to do this in the year ahead. On a positive note, nearly half (46%) of business leaders sharing that supply chain pressures have improved over the past 12 months. This is generally a result of businesses adding new suppliers from new geographies (55%), allocating more funds to cover increased costs related to moving products (55%), and shifting manufacturing and distribution closer to key markets (51%). Elevating What Success Looks Like Through Corporate Responsibility In the year ahead, business leaders have assigned paramount importance to corporate responsibility factors, citing social (74%) and environmental (64%) factors, and diversity, equity and inclusion (64%) as most important to their business strategies. Top outcomes of these corporate responsibility efforts are rooted in improving employee retention (63%), and enhancing marketing and finding new customers (60%). Planning for the Future As Indian midsize businesses prepare for the future, two thirds (66%) plan to introduce new products and services, nearly six in ten (58%) plan to expand into new geographical markets domestically, and more than half (55%) plan to expand into new distribution channels over the next 12 months. “Indian midsize company leaders’ business transfer strategies range from short-to-medium-to long term,” says Chawda. “Depending on the time horizon, the transfer method ranges from dilution through a Private Equity raise, to going public—and many transferring to family.” Nearly three quarters (74%) of Indian midsize business leaders are planning or considering a full or partial transfer of business ownership. And of those, the top business transfer method cited is to family or through a gift (32%)—and the majority (91%) expect this transfer to be complete in the next two years.

Morgan’s India Business Leaders Outlook survey was conducted online from November 21 – December 8, 2022.

At the same time, nearly six in ten (59%) feel confident about the global and national economy, and expect their revenue (77%) and profits (74%) to increase in the year ahead, according to J.P. Morgan’s second annual Australia Business Leaders Outlook survey. “Australian business leaders continue to demonstrate their resilience as they skillfully manage various geopolitical and economic obstacles,” said Annabelle Mooney, Head of Commercial Banking, Australia and New Zealand, J.P. Morgan. “While they see potential for growth in the year ahead, they’ve had to be nimble, adopting and deploying new strategies in response to changing market conditions.” In a survey of 200 senior executives of Australian midsize companies, the theme of optimism is clear with less than half (46%) of local business leaders expecting a recession in 2023—reflecting lower expectations than their recently surveyed counterparts in the U.S. (65%), U.K. (69%), India (61%), Germany (59%) and France (53%). “As we continue to withstand a complex and evolving economic environment, Australian midsize business leaders are proving once again that they have the agility to keep pushing forward and combat the challenges that arise,” said Robert Bedwell, Chief Executive Officer, J.P. Morgan Australia and New Zealand. Mitigating Inflation and Supply Chain Disruptions With headwinds of elevated inflation spanning economies around the world, seven in ten (71%) Australian midsize business leaders have experienced rising costs as a result. Of those facing inflation challenges, over two-thirds (67%) report that the increased cost of energy, as well as rising interest rates and cost of capital (61%) are driving higher business costs. The top ways decision makers are tackling inflation are through raising prices (43%), automating more processes (43%) and changing their pricing models (42%). To further mitigate costs, nearly half (45%) of Australian midsize companies are passing up to one-quarter of their increased costs onto consumers—with more than eight in ten (83%) saying they are likely to continue increasing prices. In response to supply chain disruptions, less than half of respondents (40%) note that pressures have gotten worse over the past 12 months, and one-third (33%) say they have gotten better. To counteract ongoing supply chain challenges, business leaders are allocating more funds to cover increased costs related to moving products (41%) and shifting manufacturing and distribution closer to key markets (41%). Navigating a Tight Labour Market The Australian labour environment remains top of mind for midsize business leaders, with over half (52%) expecting to add headcount in the next year. As they contend with a high demand for labour, of those preparing to hire more, they are: Offering flexible work hours (54%) Giving employees flexibility on where they work (51%) Offering upskilling and training opportunities (51%) Increasing wages and benefits (49%) Elevating What Success Looks Like Through Corporate Responsibility In the year ahead, Australian midsize business leaders are focusing on the importance of corporate responsibility factors, citing social (57%) and environmental (51%) factors, and diversity, equity and inclusion (57%) as most important to their business strategies—up 14%, 14% and 16% respectively from 2022. Top outcomes of these corporate responsibility efforts are rooted in improving employee retention (52%) and building company culture (50%), up 4% and 11% respectively from last year. Preparing for the Future As Australian midsize business leaders prepare for the future, over half expect to expand into new distribution channels (53%) and new geographical markets domestically (51%), and plan to introduce new products and services (44%). Six in ten business leaders shared they are not planning to sell or transfer ownership at this time, up 36% from 2022. For leaders considering a full or partial transfer, 30% intend to sell to a third party or management group—with 19% planning to transfer to family through a gift, up 12% from 2022. More than seven in ten (72%) of respondents are expecting transfers to take place within the next two years.

    "text": "LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nearly three-in-four (74%) U.K. midsize business leaders plan to grow in the year ahead by either adding to or maintaining their current headcount, according to J.P. Morgan’s second annual U.K. Business Leaders Outlook survey released today. This is in spite of less than half (46%) of U.K. midsize business leaders feeling upbeat about the global economy in the year ahead, down 20% from 2022—and nearly seven in ten (69%) bracing for a recession in 2023, more than any other country polled in this year’s survey. “We know 2022 was a challenging year for many businesses as they tried to recover from the pandemic amid fierce economic headwinds, and this upcoming year will bring its own set of challenges,” said Catherine Pierre, Head of Commercial Banking, U.K., J.P. Morgan. “However, it’s heartening to see the resilience U.K. decision makers are showing by focusing on recession-proofing and remaining optimistic about growth. It gives hope that U.K. businesses can weather the storm ahead and emerge on the other side stronger.” In a survey of more than 300 senior executives from U.K. midsize companies, many are feeling confident in what they can control: their own companies. Nearly three in four (73%) business leaders say they’re optimistic about their company’s performance, down 7% from 2022, and nearly nine in ten (89%) expect their revenues to increase or remain the same in the year ahead. “While optimism for the greater economy may have trended down, local decision makers are still planning for a brighter future with expected business growth,” said Vis Raghavan, Chief Executive Officer EMEA, J.P. Morgan. “British business leaders are pragmatic and are having to make strategic decisions with challenging choices given the current cards dealt and what’s expected ahead.” Energy Prices Threaten Business Success While businesses are focusing on resilience, they remain concerned about threats beyond their control. The top threat: Energy prices were cited as the biggest external threat to businesses by a quarter (25%) of respondents, overshadowing general market volatility (15%), the cost of debt and interest rates (13%) and threats of competition (11%). The business impact: Seven in ten business leaders concerned by inflationary challenges and rising costs reported that the increased cost of energy was making doing business more expensive, far outstripping the pressures of rising interest rates (53%) and increasing costs of raw materials (56%). The consumer impact: With costs soaring from inflation, almost half (48%) said they’d already had to raise prices. Many (68%) have raised prices up to 50%, while just under a quarter (22%) of those who’ve had to raise prices have done so by between 51% and 75%. Supply Chain Challenges Lead to Business Change Although energy price concerns dominate, supply chain issues remain. Supply chain woes: While some acute supply chain problems linked to the pandemic and Brexit have faded from the headlines, nearly two thirds (63%) of business leaders say supply chain pressures have worsened in the last year. A similar number (62%) say increased costs related to supply chain issues are driving the cost of business higher. Nearshoring: As supply chain worries worsened throughout the year, more U.K. businesses have taken decisive action to address it with nearly half (42%) moving manufacturing and distribution nearer to their key markets, up 12% from 2022. Other adjustments: Nearly half (46%) are now allocating more money to cover rising costs of moving products, up 10% from 2022, and less than one third (32%) have taken to strategic stockpiling to manage the issues. The Rise of the ‘S’ in ESG The range of considerations for business leaders is broad and the focus on environmental, social and governance (ESG) measures remains strong. In fact, social concerns around employees and customers now match the concern for environmental issues. Increased focus on social standards: Social factors like customer satisfaction, workplace health and safety and data privacy were reported by 56% as important to their business strategy, up 25% from 2022. They now rank as highly as environmental factors (56%), like reducing carbon emissions and energy efficiency. The benefits: The most commonly cited reason for the focus on corporate responsibility was to improve employee retention (52%). Cited nearly as often were the desire to reinforce the company’s position in the community (51%) and to enhance marketing and find new customers (49%). Business Transitions Decline As Leaders Hold On Through Tough Times The number of leaders with no plans to sell or transfer ownership of their company in the next year has increased significantly to 45%, up 16% from 2022. Future plans: Among those considering a full or partial transfer, more than half (56%) are seeking to do so through a sale or gift to family, and 74% expect the transition to be complete withing the next two years, up 24% from 2022.

    "text": "PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Selon la deuxième édition de l’enquête annuelle de J.P. Morgan, France Business Leaders Outlook (Perspectives des dirigeants d'entreprises françaises), plus de la moitié des dirigeants d’entreprises de taille moyenne françaises se sentent optimistes quant aux perspectives économiques mondiales (58 %), nationales (56 %) ainsi que locales et régionales (55 %) pour l'année à venir. Pour autant, 53 % d'entre eux s'attendent à une récession en 2023 et se préparent à ses répercussions, un taux moins élevé que leur homologues européens au Royaume-Uni (69 %) et en Allemagne (59 %). « Les défis auxquels les entreprises françaises de taille moyenne et à croissance rapide ont été confrontées ces dernières années les ont préparées à faire face à une incertitude accrue pour l'année à venir », a déclaré Olivier Simon, responsable de la banque commerciale de J.P. Morgan France et Benelux. « Les décideurs d'entreprise continuent de démontrer leur capacité à s'adapter rapidement aux défis tant locaux qu’internationaux et à les surmonter. » Dans une enquête menée auprès de plus de 250 cadres supérieurs d'entreprises françaises de taille moyenne, les dirigeants d'entreprise continuent de faire preuve de confiance et de résilience. Bien que beaucoup se préparent à une récession en 2023, près des trois quarts (72 %) prévoient de maintenir ou d’accroître leurs effectifs au cours de l'année à venir, plus des deux tiers (68 %) des dirigeants d’entreprises de taille moyenne françaises s'attendent toujours à une augmentation des revenus et des ventes, et six sur dix (61 %) prévoient une hausse des bénéfices. « De nombreuses entreprises françaises ont dû s'adapter au paysage actuel, caractérisé par une inflation élevée et d'autres contraintes externes », a déclaré Kyril Courboin, Président de J.P. Morgan France. « Bien qu'ils s'attendent concrètement à de véritables difficultés à venir, les dirigeants d'entreprises françaises sont restés assez optimistes quant aux prévisions de croissance des entreprises. » Faire face à l'inflation et relever les défis de la chaîne d'approvisionnement Alors que l'inflation continue d'être un défi majeur pour les entreprises dans le monde entier, plus de la moitié (56 %) des dirigeants d'entreprises françaises ont, en conséquence, été confrontés à une augmentation des coûts. L'impact observé : Parmi ceux confrontés à des problèmes d'inflation, deux tiers (67 %) déclarent que l'augmentation du coût des matières premières, ainsi que l'augmentation du coût de l'énergie (62 %), entraînent une hausse des coûts opérationnels et commerciaux. La réponse apportée : Pour aider à équilibrer, la plupart des dirigeants (70 %) indiquent qu'ils compensent jusqu'à la moitié de l'augmentation de leurs coûts en la répercutant sur le consommateur. Parmi ceux-ci, 85 % sont enclins à continuer à augmenter leurs prix dans l'année à venir. De plus, de nombreux dirigeants font également état de difficultés persistantes en matière de chaîne d'approvisionnement, 63 % d'entre eux indiquant que la situation s'est dégradée au cours des 12 derniers mois. Délocalisation à proximité ou ’Nearshoring’ : En réponse, 35 % des dirigeants d'entreprises françaises de taille moyenne continuent de déplacer la fabrication vers de nouvelles zones géographiques, et plus de 30 % ajoutant désormais de nouveaux fournisseurs issus de nouvelles zones géographiques, une tendance qui s'est quelque peu accélérée à partir de 2022. Autres ajustements : Les dirigeants d'entreprise sont également légèrement plus nombreux (38 %, soit 5 % de plus qu'en 2022) à augmenter leurs allocations de fonds pour couvrir les coûts plus élevés liés au déplacement des produits, tandis qu'une part similaire modifie les matériaux ou les procédés de fabrication. Naviguer l'incertitude énergétique, un défi majeur pour la communauté entrepreneuriale française Les prix de l'énergie sont considérés comme la principale menace extérieure par un tiers (33 %) des dirigeants d'entreprises françaises, ce qui reste le taux le plus élevé parmi leurs homologues européens : 25 % au Royaume-Uni et 23 % en Allemagne. En conséquence, les entreprises ayant indiqué que les prix énergétiques constituaient leur principale menace externe prévoient d'investir dans des sources d'énergie renouvelables (69 %) au cours de l'année à venir. Relever les défis du marché du travail et répondre aux urgences sociales et environnementales Les décideurs français continuent de naviguer sur le marché complexe de l'emploi et les pénuries de main-d'œuvre, et la plupart d'entre eux prévoient d'augmenter (41 %) ou de maintenir (31 %) leurs effectifs au cours du prochain exercice. Pour aider à conserver et à attirer les talents, les dirigeants d'entreprise répondent aux attentes des employés en : Augmentant les salaires et les avantages sociaux (46 %) Offrant une certaine souplesse en matière d'horaires et de lieu de travail (43 %) Investissant dans des technologies d'automatisation (43 %) Proposant des horaires de travail flexibles (42 %) La responsabilité sociale de l'entreprise reste également une priorité pour les dirigeants d’entreprises de taille moyenne françaises, qui accordent une importance accrue aux facteurs environnementaux tels que la réduction des émissions de carbone, la gestion des déchets et l'efficacité énergétique (54 %, soit 21 % de plus qu'en 2022), notamment en raison de la crise énergétique actuelle et des stratégies de conservation déployées dans toute la France. En outre, 44 % affirment que le fait de se concentrer sur les facteurs énergétiques et environnementaux a permis à leur entreprise d'établir ou de renforcer leur positionnement au sein de leur communauté, suivi par l'amélioration du marketing et la recherche de nouveaux clients (43 %). Les affaires dans l'année à venir Pour l'année à venir, les décideurs se concentrent sur l'expansion sur de nouveaux marchés — tant nationaux qu'internationaux (respectivement 46 % et 42 %) — ainsi que sur la priorité donnée aux produits et services rentables (40 %) et à l'introduction de nouveaux produits (32 %). La majorité des dirigeants d'entreprises françaises ont en outre mis en place des plans de transition complets ou partiels, un tiers d'entre eux prévoyant de céder leur entreprise à leur famille (50 %, soit 10 % de plus qu'en 2022) ou de la vendre à une tierce partie ou à un groupe spécialisé dans la gestion des ventes (33 %). La grande majorité (67 %, soit 23 % de plus qu'en 2022) s'attend à ce que ces transitions se produisent dans les deux prochaines années.

    "text": "PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--On par with last year, more than half of French midsize business leaders are feeling optimistic about the global (58%), national (56%), and local and regional (55%) economic outlook in the year ahead, according to J.P. Morgan’s second annual France Business Leaders Outlook survey released today. This is in spite of 53% expecting a recession in 2023—a lower rate than their European counterparts in the U.K. (69%) and Germany (59%)—and gearing up for its repercussions. “The challenges faced by French midsize and fast-growing companies over the last several years have prepared them for dealing with heightened uncertainty in the coming year,” said Olivier Simon, Head of Commercial Banking, France and Benelux, J.P. Morgan. “Business decision makers continue to demonstrate their ability to quickly adapt to global and local challenges and overcome them.” In a survey of more than 250 senior executives from French midsize companies, business leaders continue to showcase their confidence and resiliency. In spite of many bracing for a recession in 2023, nearly three-fourths (72%) plan to maintain or add additional headcount in the year ahead, more than two-thirds (68%) of French midsize business leaders are still expecting an increase in revenue and sales, and six in ten (61%) foresee a rise in profits. “Many French companies have had to adjust to today’s landscape of high inflation and other external pressures,” said Kyril Courboin, Head of France, Senior Country Officer, J.P. Morgan. “Though they have practical expectations of the real threats ahead, French business leaders have remained fairly optimistic with expectations for business growth.” Responding to Inflation and Navigating Supply Chain Challenges As inflation continues to be a top challenge for the business community globally, more than half (56%) of French business leaders have experienced rising costs as a result. The business leader’s impact: Of those experiencing inflation challenges, two-thirds (67%) report that the increased cost of raw materials, as well as the increased cost of energy (62%) is driving higher business costs. The business leader’s response: To help compensate, most leaders (70%) indicate they are offsetting up to half of their increased costs by passing them along to the consumer. Of those, 85% are likely to continue increasing prices for their consumers in the year ahead. Additionally, many business leaders also report continued supply chain challenges, with 63% noting that it has worsened over the past 12 months. Nearshoring: In response, 35% of French midsize businesses leaders are continuing to shift manufacturing to new geographies, and more than 30% now adding new suppliers from new geographies, a trend that has somewhat accelerated from 2022. Other adjustments: Slightly more business leaders (38%, up 5% from 2022) are also increasing their allocation of funds to cover higher costs related to moving products while a similar share is changing materials or manufacturing processes. Navigating Energy Uncertainty, A Top Challenge for the French Business Community Energy prices are considered the top external threat by one-third (33%) of French business leaders, which remain the highest among their European counterparts: UK (25%) and Germany (23%). As a result, companies who noted energy prices as their top external threat plan to invest in renewable energy sources (69%) in the coming year. Responding to Labor Market Challenges and Addressing Social and Environmental Urgencies French decision makers continue to navigate the complex job market and labor shortages, and most expect to either add to (41%) or maintain (31%) headcount over the next 12 months. To help retain and attract talent, business leaders are responding to employee expectations by: Increasing wages and benefits (46%) Providing flexibility on work hours and location (43%) Investing in automation technology (43%) Offering flexible work hours (42%) Corporate social responsibility also remains a priority for French midsize business leaders, who place increased importance on environmental factors like reducing carbon emissions, waste management and energy efficiency (54%, up 21% from 2022), particularly in light of the current energy crisis and conservation strategies being rolled out across France. In addition, 44% claim that focusing on energy and environmental factors has enabled their company to establish or reinforce their positioning within the community, followed by enhancing marketing and finding new customers (43%). Business in the Year Ahead In the upcoming year, decision makers are focused on expansion into new markets—both domestic and international (46% and 42%, respectively)—as well as the prioritization of profitable products and services (40%) and introduction of new products (32%). Additionally, the majority of French business leaders have a full or partial transition plan in place with one-third planning to transfer to family (50%, up 10% from 2022) or sell to a third party or sales management group (33%). The vast majority (67%, up 23% from 2022) expect these transitions to take place in the next two years.

    "text": "FRANKFURT, Germany--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Optimism is falling among German Mittelstand leaders, with nearly six in ten (59%) expecting a recession in 2023, and more are feeling pessimistic about the global (24%) and national (28%) economy compared to last year, according to J.P. Morgan’s third annual Germany Business Leaders Outlook survey released today. “As uncertainties persist into the year ahead, it does not come as a surprise that business leaders have a more subdued outlook on the economy,” said Bernhard Brinker, Head of Commercial Banking, DACH Region, J.P. Morgan. “At the same time, however, we recognize that Mittelstand companies are resilient and have taken thoughtful precautions to navigate through this uncertain environment.” In a survey of more than 250 senior executives of German Mittelstand companies, many leaders still expect their business to grow in revenue (69%) and profits (59%), though these figures are down 10% and 14% respectively from 2022. More than half (56%) expect capital expenditures to increase, down 10% from 2022, with nearly two out of three expecting capital needs (64%) to also increase. “While companies are bracing themselves for a harsher business climate, we see that the German Mittelstand community is tackling the economic challenges proactively and continues to have conviction about the strength and success of their businesses,” said Stefan Povaly, Head of Germany, Senior Country Officer, J.P. Morgan. Adapting and Solving for Persistent Business Challenges Business challenges like supply chain issues were evident throughout 2022, with nearly six in ten (57%) leaders citing that supply chain pressures have gotten worse over the past 12 months. To account for this, those experiencing supply chain pressures are allocating more funds to cover increased costs related to moving products (45%), focusing on strategic stockpiling (40%) and are near-shoring by shifting manufacturing or distribution closer to their key markets (39%). While those experiencing higher costs of doing business cite increased cost of energy (77%) as the biggest driver, nearly a quarter (23%) of Mittelstand leaders see energy prices as the number one external threat or risk to their business. Notably, nearly seven in ten (69%) companies still face inflation challenges, and more than half (53%) have raised prices to account for inflation. Of those who have raised prices, the largest share (36%) is passing along 26%-50% of their increased costs on to their consumers. This trend is likely to stay, as a vast majority (83%) of those passing along costs plan to continue to do so. Creatively Attracting and Retaining Top Talent In the midst of continued economic headwinds, 39% of Mittelstand leaders are planning to add headcount and 38% plan to maintain their current headcount in the year ahead. In light of the current labor environment, Mittelstand leaders planning to add or maintain headcount are taking a variety of measures to attract and retain talent through: Increasing wages and benefits (52%) Offering flexible work hours (51%) Offering upskilling and training opportunities (44%) Investing in automation technology (40%) Continued Search for Growth as Attitudes Toward Ownership Change Mittelstand companies continue to look for ways to generate growth and secure the future of their business. When asked about their plans for the next 12 months, almost half of Mittelstand leaders said they are planning to grow their business by expanding into new geographical markets both internationally (43%) and domestically (41%), developing strategic partnerships or investments (42%) and expanding into new distribution channels (41%). Unlike previous years, 55% of Mittelstand leaders are not planning to sell or transfer ownership of their company in the next 12 months, up 25% from 2022. Of those who have a transition plan in place, 36% plan to transfer to family through a sale, up 23% from 2022—and notably less (27%) plan to sell to a third party or management group if they’re transferring ownership, down 17% from 2022. Nearly eight in ten (78%) of those considering a full or partial transfer expect it to take place within the next two years, up 32% from 2022. Elevating What Success Looks Like Through Corporate Responsibility In the year ahead, Mittelstand leaders are focusing on importance of corporate responsibility factors, citing social (56%) and environmental (49%) factors, and governance (48%) as most important to their business strategies—up 15%, 9% and 19% respectively from 2022. Top outcomes of these corporate responsibility efforts are rooted in enhancing marketing and finding new customers (54%) and establishing the company’s position within the community (51%).

    "text": "WILMINGTON, Del.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, on National Lose the Jet Lag Day, the United Family of Cards from Chase announced that it has teamed up with Timeshifter, the world’s most advanced circadian technology platform, to launch the “Jet Set & Reset” pledge and Sweepstakes* designed to help travelers understand and tackle the underlying cause of jet lag - a nemesis to great travel. Exclusive to United MileagePlus® members, those who take the “Jet Set & Reset” pledge to take on jet lag in 2023 will be entered into a Sweepstakes for a chance to win a prize from three potential prize categories that help turn those pledges into action: One (1) winner will receive a year-long subscription to the Timeshifter jet lag app and 1 million United MileagePlus miles, the ultimate package for more and better travel experiences. Eight (8) people will receive a year-long subscription to the Timeshifter jet lag app and 500K United MileagePlus miles. 500 pledge takers will win a year-long subscription to the Timeshifter jet lag app, which provides highly personalized plans for managing jet lag. “The United Family of Cards from Chase brings more and better travel to the world through card rewards and benefits, and the turn of the new year is the perfect time to commit to getting the most out of travel,” said Laurinda Rainey, General Manager of United Co-Brand Cards at Chase. “We are excited to launch this Sweepstakes on National Lose the Jet Lag Day to raise awareness of the impact jet lag has on travel.” According to Timeshifter, jet lag causes significant human and financial costs – from poor concentration and reduced productivity to less enjoyment and weakened immune function. Timeshifter debunks common jet lag myths and replaces them with real science, allowing travelers to control circadian rhythms by taking small actions at specific times to ensure they arrive at their best. “When I was an astronaut, we learned how to shift our circadian rhythms to prepare for rocket launches and spacewalks. Because our circadian clock regulates our sleep, alertness and almost all other biological systems in our body, it was key to our safety, performance and health,” said Mike Massimino, former NASA Astronaut and Timeshifter Advisor. “It’s gratifying to see circadian science finally being applied outside of NASA to equip travelers to tackle jet lag, and I applaud Chase and United for shining a light on jet lag health with their ‘Jet Set & Reset’ campaign.” The Timeshifter jet lag app was developed with world-renowned scientists, led by Associate Professor at Harvard Medical School and Timeshifter’s Chief Scientist, Dr. Steven W. Lockley, based on the latest research in sleep and circadian neuroscience. The app provides users with highly personalized jet lag plans based on their normal sleep pattern, chronotype, itinerary and personal preferences. “We want United flyers to enjoy their travel experiences on and off the plane, and our United Family of Cards from Chase help people maximize their travel,” said Marketing & Loyalty VP and MileagePlus President, Luc Bondar. “We’re excited to kick off the new year with an opportunity for travelers to take on jet lag and commit to getting the most out of their travel in 2023. With our expanded network reach this year, travelers have more access to their favorite destinations and new places they have yet to visit.” Take the pledge to enter the Sweepstakes, and learn tips for overcoming jet lag by visiting: https://jetsetreset.chase.com.
