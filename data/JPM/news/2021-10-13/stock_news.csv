These commitments and policy solutions are part of the firm’s $30 billion commitment to advance racial equity and help drive an inclusive economic recovery. JPMorgan Chase Institute research has shown almost one in four renters experienced a greater than 10 percent drop in total income during the pandemic, even after accounting for government support, but did not have a forbearance safety net like homeowners, creating economic vulnerabilities for both renters and landlords. Through JPMorgan Chase’s commitments, six organizations will design and test innovative models to improve household stability with the goal of expanding successful models across the U.S. This includes eviction prevention support, rental assistance, access to legal services and resources for small landlords. “Access to safe, affordable housing is key to building wealth but out of reach for far too many families,” said Heather Higginbottom, President, JPMorgan Chase PolicyCenter and Co-Head of Global Philanthropy. “Today’s announcement will help promote immediate housing stability for underserved households and is one step toward our goal of addressing barriers to affordable housing and homeownership, especially for Black, Latino and Hispanic families.” Organizations receiving philanthropic capital: Community Justice Project (Miami, FL) At least 31% of Florida renters could be at risk of eviction by the end of the year.1 With JPMorgan Chase’s $1.6 million three-year investment, Community Justice Project (CJP) will implement a community lawyering model supporting grassroots organizations and tenant-led campaigns to help stop evictions and improve conditions for renters. CJP aims to expand this model beyond Miami-Dade to eight other counties across Florida. Community Legal Services (Philadelphia, PA) During the pandemic, Philadelphia landlords filed to evict 4,500 tenants, disproportionately impacting Black, Latino and Hispanic communities, and the number of filings is expected to significantly increase as COVID-related tenant protections expire.2 With JPMorgan Chase’s $1.5 million three-year investment, Community Legal Services will expand its program design and build capacity to alter the eviction landscape in Philadelphia by combining the following three initiatives: eviction alternatives, right to counsel and eviction record screening protections. The COVID-19 Eviction Defense Project (Colorado) At least 25% of renters in Colorado could be at risk of eviction by the end of year.3 With JPMorgan Chase’s $1.3 million two-year investment, The COVID-19 Eviction Defense Project will support eviction prevention through a strategic model that provides tenants with resources for household stability such as rental assistance, negotiation services, legal services and rehousing placements. Equal Justice Works (Richmond, VA) Five of the top ten cities with the highest eviction rates in the United States are located in the Commonwealth of Virginia.4 With JPMorgan Chase’s $1.5 million three-year investment, Equal Justice Works will bring together a group of lawyers and community organizers (‘Fellows’) as part of its Housing Justice Program to increase access to high-quality legal services and tenant resources for low-income Black, Latino and Hispanic households and residents of public housing. Housing Justice Program Fellows will also engage in high impact litigation to support practices that protect the rights of tenants across Virginia. Neighborhood Housing Services of Chicago (Chicago, IL) In Illinois, 22% of Black renters and 17% of Hispanic and Latino renters are behind on their rent, compared to 9% of white renters.5 With JPMorgan Chase’s $1 million three-year investment, Neighborhood Housing Services of Chicago (NHS Chicago) will provide rental assistance and counseling to around 675 households. NHS Chicago will also support small-unit landlords through rental and mortgage assistance, housing mediation services, renter relocation grants, post-purchase counseling, financial assessments and foreclosure prevention support. Texas Housers (Houston, TX) In Texas, more than 800,000 low-income renter households compete for around 244,000 rental units that are affordable and available to them.6 With JPMorgan Chase’s $1.5 million three-year investment, Texas Housers will provide low-income tenants in Texas with access to resources and advice to help secure rental assistance and long-term affordable housing. This includes helping tenants understand government emergency rental assistance programs and how to protect their homes when facing eviction. The investment will also fund Texas Housers’s work to support and expand a statewide collaboration of tenants and supporters engaged in research and policy discussions to increase the supply of affordable rental housing and secure essential tenant protections at the state and local level. Advancing Data Driven Policy Solutions Recently, the JPMorgan Chase PolicyCenter released data-driven policy recommendations to improve household stability weakened by the pandemic. These recommendations mirror the work of the organizations receiving philanthropic commitments. For example, the firm is supporting policies that: Implement fair eviction standards to help ensure stability and improve outcomes for tenants and landlords; Reduce preventable evictions by establishing eviction diversion programs, applying eviction principles, such as right to counsel, that protect tenants from unlawful eviction and helping ensure a balanced and predictable eviction process; Expand access to homelessness and eviction prevention programs, as well as legal assistance services that help renters navigate their housing options and rights, emergency shelter, and rapid re-housing; and Standardize the collection and tracking, of state and local level eviction data to better inform policy decisions.

The following is the Executive Summary. The full fact sheet is available online here. Executive Summary In October 2020, JPMorgan Chase announced the $30 Billion Racial Equity Commitment to help close the racial wealth gap among Black, Hispanic and Latino communities. The firm is bringing together its business, philanthropy, policy and data expertise to advance racial equity and drive inclusive growth. The five-year Commitment includes lending, equity and direct funding to help increase sustainable homeownership, expand affordable housing, grow small businesses, support diverse suppliers, improve financial health and access to banking and build a more diverse and inclusive workforce. The firm is building the infrastructure and foundation to make progress on its Racial Equity Commitment. With more work to do, below is a summary of progress. Moving forward, JPMorgan Chase plans to publish its progress annually in its Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) report starting in May 2022. Summary of Progress JPMorgan Chase has deployed or committed more than $13 billion of its $30 billion goal to help close the racial wealth gap. This is largely driven by homeownership refinance and affordable rental housing preservation, which were existing products and processes where the firm took prompt action to do more. While there is more work to do, below is an update on the Commitment. Mortgage Refinance: Given the historically low rate environment, the firm quickly helped homeowners save money on their monthly mortgage payments by refinancing 16,000 of the 20,000 incremental loans goal, $4 billion to date.1 Homeownership: Hired more than 130 Community Home Lending Advisors, expanded the homebuyer grant program to $5,000 in 6,700 minority neighborhoods nationwide and enhanced mortgage products to create better access to credit through pricing improvements and credit expansion. Affordable Rental Housing: Funded more than $6 billion in loans to help preserve more than 60,000 affordable housing and rental housing units across the U.S. Also approved lending of $1 billion for the new construction and rehabilitation of affordable housing for low- and moderate-income households. Grow Small Business: Hired more than 20 diverse senior business consultants to provide free one-on-one coaching for business owners in 13 U.S. cities and have mentored more than 900 small business owners so far. Financial Health: Helped customers open more than 200,000 low cost checking accounts with no overdraft fees. Opened nine Community Center branches and hired 72 Community Managers in underserved communities to build and nurture relationships with community leaders, nonprofit partners and small businesses. Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs) and Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs): Invested more than $100 million of equity in 14 diverse-owned or -led MDIs and CDFIs that serve more than 87 communities in 18 states and the District of Columbia. Workforce: Grew partnerships with Historically Black Colleges and Universities from 3 to 17 to deepen the firm’s recruiting partnerships, expand curriculum development, scholarships and mentorship programs. The firm pledged to hire 4,000 Black students by 2024. It has hired more than 3,800 Black students as interns, fellows and entry-level analysts and is on track to surpass the original goal. Philanthropy: Committed $128 million of its five-year, $2 billion philanthropic target, which includes grants, low cost loans and direct equity. The firm is on pace to allocate its full year target of more than $400 million by the end of the year. Additional Activities: The Racial Equity Commitment has been a catalyst for evolving how the firm does business and has inspired other activities and investments that go above and beyond the $30 billion. Some examples include creating an Empower money market share class, co-investing $200 million in Project Black, elevating DEI standards as part of its supply chain assessment and investing in the Appraiser Diversity Initiative. Visit jpmorganchase.com to learn more. Reporting and Governance: Established a robust reporting and governance process for consistent tracking of the $30 billion Commitment, which is run by the Community Impact organization. The Public Responsibility Committee (PRC) of the JPMorgan Chase Board of Directors provides oversight of this work and is briefed bimonthly on the firm’s progress. Next Steps Building on the hiring of community managers, community home lending advisors and small business consultants, the creation and enhancement of products, expansion of new branches in more communities and other efforts, the firm plans to take the following next steps. Homeownership: Continue prudently expanding FHA lending and supporting policy reforms to the FHA program, including servicing standards. Affordable Rental Housing: Explore innovative financing solutions and work with new public resources to support the development of vital community facilities and new housing for individuals and families earning a wider range of incomes than conventional projects serve. Small Business: Further expand access to credit through targeted adjustments to how the firm evaluates credit applications, and it will introduce new product offerings. Financial Health: Continue to open more branches, including Community Center branches in low-to-moderate income communities, hire additional Community Managers and host more financial health workshops. Workforce: Continue to build a more equitable and representative workforce and hold executives accountable. Community Engagement: Host more local convenings with executives who play a direct role in the development of products, services, policy solutions and community investments. Multicultural Engagement: Explore opportunities to expand access to in-language resources, services and support in accordance with the latest guidelines from industry regulators.

El siguiente es el resumen ejecutivo. La hoja informativa completa está disponible en línea aquí. Resumen ejecutivo En octubre de 2020, JPMorgan Chase anunció una inversión de $30,000 millones en su Compromiso de Equidad Racial para ayudar a eliminar la brecha de riqueza racial entre las comunidades afroamericana, hispana y latina. La empresa está combinando sus conocimientos empresariales, filantrópicos, políticos y de datos para promover la equidad racial e impulsar el crecimiento inclusivo. El Compromiso de cinco años incluye préstamos, capital y financiación directa para ayudar a aumentar las viviendas en propiedad sostenibles, ampliar las viviendas asequibles, impulsar el crecimiento de las pequeñas empresas, apoyar a proveedores diversos, mejorar las condiciones financieras y el acceso a la banca y crear una mano de obra más diversa e inclusiva. La firma creó la infraestructura y los cimientos para avanzar en su Compromiso de Equidad Racial. Aunque aún queda mucho por hacer, a continuación se presenta un resumen del progreso hasta la fecha. De cara al futuro, JPMorgan Chase tiene previsto publicar sus avances anualmente en su informe medioambiental, social y de gobierno (ESG) a partir de mayo de 2022. Resumen de los avances JPMorgan Chase ha distribuido o comprometido más de $13,000 millones de dólares de su objetivo de $30,000 millones para ayudar a cerrar la brecha de riqueza racial. Esto viene impulsado en gran medida por la refinanciación de las viviendas en propiedad y la preservación de la vivienda de alquiler asequible, que eran productos y procesos existentes en los que la empresa tomó medidas inmediatas para actuar más. Si bien queda mucho trabajo por hacer, a continuación ofrecemos una actualización del Compromiso. Refinanciación de hipotecas: Dado el contexto de tipos históricamente bajos, la empresa ayudó rápidamente a los propietarios de viviendas a ahorrar dinero en sus pagos hipotecarios mensuales mediante la refinanciación de 16,000 de los 20,000 préstamos crecientes objetivo, 4,000 millones de dólares hasta la fecha.1 Viviendas en propiedad: Se contrataron más de 130 Community Home Lending Advisors que asesoran a compradores, se amplió el programa de ayudas a la compra de vivienda a $5,000 dólares en 6,700 barrios minoritarios de todo el país y se mejoraron los productos hipotecarios para crear un mejor acceso al crédito mediante mejoras en los precios y la ampliación del crédito. Viviendas de alquiler asequibles: Se financiaron más de $6,000 millones de dólares en préstamos para ayudar a preservar más de 60,000 viviendas de alquiler asequibles a lo largo de Estados Unidos. También se aprobaron préstamos por valor de $1,000 millones de dólares para la nueva construcción y rehabilitación de viviendas asequibles para hogares con ingresos bajos y moderados. Crecimiento de la pequeña empresa: Se contrataron más de 20 consultores empresariales de alto nivel para que ofrecieran asesoramiento individualizado y gratuito a propietarios de empresas en 13 ciudades de Estados Unidos y, hasta ahora, han asesorado a más de 900 propietarios de pequeñas empresas. Condiciones financieras: Se ayudó a los clientes a abrir más de 200,000 cuentas corrientes de bajo costo sin comisiones por sobregiro.

La empresa se comprometió a contratar a 4,000 estudiantes afroamericanos para 2024. Hasta la fecha, la firma ha contratado a más de 3,800 estudiantes negros como becarios y analistas de nivel inicial, y está en camino de superar el objetivo original. Filantropía: Se comprometieron $128 millones de dólares de su objetivo filantrópico de $2,000 millones, que incluye subvenciones, préstamos económicos y capital directo. La empresa está en camino de alcanzar su objetivo anual de más de 400 millones de dólares a finales de año. Actividades adicionales: El Compromiso de Equidad Racial se ha convertido en un catalizador para la evolución de la forma de hacer negocios de la empresa y ha inspirado otras actividades e inversiones que van más allá de los $30,000 millones de dólares. Algunos ejemplos son la creación de una clase de acciones del mercado monetario Empower, la coinversión de $200 millones de dólares en el Project Black, la elevación de las normas de diversidad, equidad e inclusión (DEI) como parte de su evaluación de la cadena de suministro y la inversión en la iniciativa Appraiser Diversity.

Próximos pasos Sobre la base de la contratación de gerentes comunitatios, asesores de préstamos comunitarios para viviendas Community Home Lending Advisors y consultores de pequeños negocios, la creación y mejora de productos, la expansión de nuevas sucursales en más comunidades y otros esfuerzos, la empresa tiene previsto dar los siguientes pasos.
