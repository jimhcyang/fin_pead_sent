    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--StartOut today announced a $500,000 philanthropic commitment from JPMorgan Chase to expand on the organization’s StartOut Pride Economic Inclusion Index (SPEII) which provides near real-time, data-driven insights into the US entrepreneurial ecosystem. This Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) Impact Program will examine the effectiveness of various public policies by measuring LGBTQ+ and other underrepresented entrepreneurs’ economic impact in the US with respect to job creation, patents, financings and exits. The investment from JPMorgan Chase will help to highlight effective local, state and federal policies which can generate successful outcomes for these entrepreneurs. The project aims to guide the deployment of capital toward the most impactful policies, leveraging the foundational work already done on the SPEII. “The generous philanthropic investment from JPMorgan Chase will allow our project to gather even more comprehensive entrepreneurial data and thus expand the depth of our insights in terms of how best to achieve specific outcomes,” said Andres Wydler, StartOut’s executive director. This investment is part of JPMorgan Chase’s broader effort to advance equity for underserved communities. The program, originally developed in June 2019, is supported under JPMorgan Chase’s $350M Small Business Commitment to expand opportunities for underserved entrepreneurs. The initial SPEII that was jointly published with Socos Labs and quantified both the economic contributions and unrealized potential of LGBTQ+ entrepreneurs in near real-time. Data findings addressed the talent and resource gap with a goal of improving and supporting founders with diverse backgrounds. “We couldn’t be more pleased to advance our support for the Inclusion Impact Indexes, with one of our strategic non-profit partners, StartOut,” says Brad Baumoel, Global Head of LGBT+ Affairs at JPMorgan Chase. “This work aligns so well to our firmwide efforts to advance business growth and entrepreneurship for the LGBT+ Community.” Initial Inclusion Impact Indexes insights show that over the last 20 years, for example: More inclusive access to resources for LGBTQ+ entrepreneurs would have created over 400,000 additional jobs in the US, and 1.2 million additional jobs for female entrepreneurs. Less than half a percent of all US high-growth entrepreneurs publicly identify as LGBTQ+. $1 trillion in exits could have reached about $2 trillion if all entrepreneurs had been given equal access to resources. Women entrepreneurs raised $150 billion in funding while their potential was over $400 billion. Socos Lab’s co-founder Dr. Vivienne Ming added, “The Inclusion Impact Index uses big data analysis and a custom AI-driven engine to measure the contributions of entrepreneurs and then calculates what they could have achieved with equal access. Policies play an important role and we’re excited to examine their impact on a granular level, all the way to individual metropolitan areas.” StartOut values the continued pro bono support from Crunchbase and the many collaborators who are inviting their entrepreneurs to take part in the confidential survey. The list of collaborators is growing and includes 500 Startups, Aleria Research, Aspen Tech Policy Hub, AWS, Bunker Labs, FLIK, Global Entrepreneurship Network, Google for Startups, Halcyon, Impact Hub New York Metropolitan Area, NVCA/Venture Forward, KiwiTech, Nasdaq Entrepreneurial Center, Out Leadership, PayPal, PitchBook, Republic, Reaching Out MBA, Silicon Valley Bank, Social Venture Circle, TechCrunch, Techstars, US SEC Small Business Advocacy Team, Vets in Tech and many others. StartOut and their collaborators invite all entrepreneurs throughout the US to participate in this seminal DEI project and this survey. Participation is entirely voluntary, and all responses are held in confidentiality. Only aggregated, anonymized insights are shared publicly. Entrepreneurs in the US can easily complete the survey in 2-4 minutes and it can be accessed securely online at: https://bit.ly/3gSealD The StartOut Pride Economic Impact Index is publicly available for free to all at www.inclusionindexes.org or www.startout.org/speii.

Now through December 31, small business owners who operate restaurants, wineries, pop-ups, and events will receive up to $1,200 to put towards monthly subscription fees when they join Tock for one year and link their Chase business checking account. By joining Tock, Chase small business owners get access to an innovative reservation and ordering platform, as well as the Tock to Go takeout and delivery program, reaching millions of diners across the country. Their businesses will also be integrated into Chase Dining within Ultimate Rewards, a program where millions of Chase credit card customers can earn and redeem points towards any pre-paid reservation, takeout order or events and experience on Tock. Current Chase Business Banking customers who enroll in the Tock Plus plan with their business checking account will receive one month free, and $1,000 to put towards future fees. Those already on Tock with a Chase business checking account linked will receive $1,200 to use towards subscription fees. The restaurant industry has been among the hardest hit by the COVID-19 crisis. As more local businesses quickly reopen, this new offer will help remove barriers including access to service tools and support small business growth. “In many ways, reopening is more difficult than the initial shock of the pandemic,” said Nick Kokonas, CEO of Tock. “Service industry businesses cannot just flip a light switch to scale operations. Tock and Chase want to help by not only making operations more efficient, but also by backing that up with cash.” “Restaurant owners and those in the hospitality business have inspired us over the past year with how quickly they’ve adapted to unprecedented challenges,” said Jennifer Roberts, CEO of Chase Business Banking. “With Tock, we are providing entrepreneurs with an all-in-one system to reach their customers online so that they can focus on what’s important - running their business. We love restaurants and want to do everything we can to support them as they recover.” To receive the Tock offer, eligible small business owners need to complete these steps by Dec. 31, 2021: 1. Sign up with Tock at exploretock.com/join/chase-for-business 2. Link their Chase business checking account to Tock.

    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--As much of the country reopens nearly a year and a half since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S., midsize business leaders’ optimism about their industries and companies hit record highs, according to JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Business Leaders Outlook Pulse survey released today. Nearly 9 in 10 business leaders (88%) are optimistic about their company’s performance for the next six months, the highest percentage recorded in 11 years of the survey, and up from 56% one year ago at the height of the pandemic in the U.S. Survey participants are also feeling confident about the industry they’re in: 82% are optimistic about their industry’s performance, a significant jump from 45% a year ago. This rising confidence extends to the broader economy as well. Three-quarters of respondents are optimistic about the local (76%) and national economy (75%), each representing an increase of at least 40 percentage points from a year ago. Optimism about the global economy, which has traditionally been more muted, is at its highest level (53%) since 2018, up from just 17% last summer. The rosy outlook is driving ambitious growth plans for companies: the majority (80%) anticipate a rise in revenue/sales, and close to half (46%) expect to increase investments in capital expenditures, up from 18% one year ago. In line with these growth plans, nearly 4 in 10 businesses (38%) expect an increase in credit needs for the remainder of 2021. “After enduring the challenges of the last year and a half, businesses are feeling overwhelmingly positive about what’s ahead,” said Jim Glassman, head economist, JPMorgan Chase Commercial Banking. “The focus now is on navigating growing pains to harness the momentum of the economic recovery, which is comparatively a good problem to have.” Businesses’ Pandemic-Related Changes Are Here to Stay The disruptions brought on by the pandemic forced businesses to adapt quickly and evolve their business models, with some of these changes expected to be permanent. The top strategic actions business leaders have taken include: Introducing New Offerings: The majority (61%) have diversified and strengthened their offerings by delivering new product and service lines, with many planning to maintain these products and services post-pandemic. Digitizing Operations: 39% of businesses expanded their e-commerce capabilities as more customers shopped online, and 38% digitized their accounts payables and receivables processes to boost efficiency. Expanding Geographically: In addition to reaching customers via new digital channels, 38% of businesses expanded into new geographic markets. “Businesses are proving yet again that when put to the test, they adapt, innovate and rise to the occasion – and in many cases, become stronger and gain market share,” said John Simmons, head of Middle Market Banking & Specialized Industries, JPMorgan Chase Commercial Banking. “We’re working with our clients to help chart a path forward and lean into new opportunities, from digitizing manual back-office processes to evaluating strategic transactions like a merger or sale.” Supply Chain Issues Are a Top Challenge Businesses’ supply chains were hit particularly hard by the events of the past year and a half, and ongoing supply chain issues top the list of challenges for the year ahead. Companies report having to utilize new suppliers, digitize back-office functions and manage their supply chain remotely, with many of them planning to maintain these changes in the future. Other challenges cited by business leaders include uncertain economic conditions and sustaining revenue and sales growth. Businesses are also contending with the reality of a tight labor market as the large majority (81%) hope to hire more workers in the next six months, especially as large numbers of experienced Baby Boomers retire. Cybersecurity is also a growing concern, as one-third of companies report being directly impacted by a cyberattack or fraud since March 2020. Among the businesses that have experienced attacks, 79% say employee education and training has been the most helpful mitigation tactic, and 56% say proactive countermeasures, including deploying new technologies, have been beneficial. The New Workplace With pandemic-related restrictions recently lifted or modified in many parts of the country, businesses are reevaluating their working models. Thirty-eight percent expect all employees to return to on-site work, while one in four respondents (26%) are newly implementing a flexible working model. Of the businesses that are taking a flexible approach, preserving company culture is a top concern, followed by maintaining productivity levels. Looking Forward Companies should factor the following considerations into their business plans to position themselves for success in the year ahead: For more information on the 2021 Business Leaders Outlook Pulse survey, please visit jpmorgan.com/2021midyearoutlook.

    "text": "WILMINGTON, Del.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Chase Sapphire®, in collaboration with restaurant discovery platform, The Infatuation, announces “Sapphire Supports Restaurants Contest,” an initiative that will give 20 grants of $50,000 each to small business restaurants across America to provide COVID-19 pandemic recovery assistance. Starting today, consumers can nominate their favorite local restaurant to be eligible to win one of 20 $50,000 grants. Contest entries are centered around a prompt asking diners across the country to share what their favorite local restaurant means to them, the role the restaurant plays in the community, and to describe the tenacity they’ve shown through the pandemic. “Small businesses and local restaurants are the heartbeat of our neighborhoods,” said Marleta Ross, General Manager of Chase Sapphire. “The past year has been challenging, especially for the smaller, local places that are some of our favorites. Sapphire wants to recognize these establishments, the people behind them and the service they provide for their communities and help them along in their recovery so they can keep doing what they do best.” Entries will be accepted through August 16, 2021 and will be reviewed by a panel of culinary industry insiders who will consider a variety of factors including the restaurant's impact to the community; their innovation or creativity during the pandemic; and the nominator's passion for the restaurant. There will be five winning restaurants from each of the four geographical regions across the U.S. Eligible restaurants must be located in the United States; have no more than two locations; no more than 50 full-time employees; and have been open prior to or as of March 1, 2020.
