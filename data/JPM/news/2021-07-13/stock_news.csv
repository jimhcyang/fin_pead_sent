Nearly 9 in 10 business leaders (88%) are optimistic about their company’s performance for the next six months, the highest percentage recorded in 11 years of the survey, and up from 56% one year ago at the height of the pandemic in the U.S. Survey participants are also feeling confident about the industry they’re in: 82% are optimistic about their industry’s performance, a significant jump from 45% a year ago. This rising confidence extends to the broader economy as well. Three-quarters of respondents are optimistic about the local (76%) and national economy (75%), each representing an increase of at least 40 percentage points from a year ago. Optimism about the global economy, which has traditionally been more muted, is at its highest level (53%) since 2018, up from just 17% last summer. The rosy outlook is driving ambitious growth plans for companies: the majority (80%) anticipate a rise in revenue/sales, and close to half (46%) expect to increase investments in capital expenditures, up from 18% one year ago. In line with these growth plans, nearly 4 in 10 businesses (38%) expect an increase in credit needs for the remainder of 2021. “After enduring the challenges of the last year and a half, businesses are feeling overwhelmingly positive about what’s ahead,” said Jim Glassman, head economist, JPMorgan Chase Commercial Banking. “The focus now is on navigating growing pains to harness the momentum of the economic recovery, which is comparatively a good problem to have.” Businesses’ Pandemic-Related Changes Are Here to Stay The disruptions brought on by the pandemic forced businesses to adapt quickly and evolve their business models, with some of these changes expected to be permanent. The top strategic actions business leaders have taken include: Introducing New Offerings: The majority (61%) have diversified and strengthened their offerings by delivering new product and service lines, with many planning to maintain these products and services post-pandemic. Digitizing Operations: 39% of businesses expanded their e-commerce capabilities as more customers shopped online, and 38% digitized their accounts payables and receivables processes to boost efficiency. Expanding Geographically: In addition to reaching customers via new digital channels, 38% of businesses expanded into new geographic markets. “Businesses are proving yet again that when put to the test, they adapt, innovate and rise to the occasion – and in many cases, become stronger and gain market share,” said John Simmons, head of Middle Market Banking & Specialized Industries, JPMorgan Chase Commercial Banking. “We’re working with our clients to help chart a path forward and lean into new opportunities, from digitizing manual back-office processes to evaluating strategic transactions like a merger or sale.” Supply Chain Issues Are a Top Challenge Businesses’ supply chains were hit particularly hard by the events of the past year and a half, and ongoing supply chain issues top the list of challenges for the year ahead. Companies report having to utilize new suppliers, digitize back-office functions and manage their supply chain remotely, with many of them planning to maintain these changes in the future. Other challenges cited by business leaders include uncertain economic conditions and sustaining revenue and sales growth. Businesses are also contending with the reality of a tight labor market as the large majority (81%) hope to hire more workers in the next six months, especially as large numbers of experienced Baby Boomers retire. Cybersecurity is also a growing concern, as one-third of companies report being directly impacted by a cyberattack or fraud since March 2020. Among the businesses that have experienced attacks, 79% say employee education and training has been the most helpful mitigation tactic, and 56% say proactive countermeasures, including deploying new technologies, have been beneficial. The New Workplace With pandemic-related restrictions recently lifted or modified in many parts of the country, businesses are reevaluating their working models. Thirty-eight percent expect all employees to return to on-site work, while one in four respondents (26%) are newly implementing a flexible working model. Of the businesses that are taking a flexible approach, preserving company culture is a top concern, followed by maintaining productivity levels. Looking Forward Companies should factor the following considerations into their business plans to position themselves for success in the year ahead: For more information on the 2021 Business Leaders Outlook Pulse survey, please visit jpmorgan.com/2021midyearoutlook.

Starting today, consumers can nominate their favorite local restaurant to be eligible to win one of 20 $50,000 grants. Contest entries are centered around a prompt asking diners across the country to share what their favorite local restaurant means to them, the role the restaurant plays in the community, and to describe the tenacity they’ve shown through the pandemic. “Small businesses and local restaurants are the heartbeat of our neighborhoods,” said Marleta Ross, General Manager of Chase Sapphire. “The past year has been challenging, especially for the smaller, local places that are some of our favorites. Sapphire wants to recognize these establishments, the people behind them and the service they provide for their communities and help them along in their recovery so they can keep doing what they do best.” Entries will be accepted through August 16, 2021 and will be reviewed by a panel of culinary industry insiders who will consider a variety of factors including the restaurant's impact to the community; their innovation or creativity during the pandemic; and the nominator's passion for the restaurant. There will be five winning restaurants from each of the four geographical regions across the U.S. Eligible restaurants must be located in the United States; have no more than two locations; no more than 50 full-time employees; and have been open prior to or as of March 1, 2020.
