    "site": "businesswire.com",
    "text": "OLDWICK, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--AM Best has affirmed the Financial Strength Rating of A (Excellent) and the Long-Term Issuer Credit Rating of “a” of Park Assurance Company (Park) (Colchester, VT). The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable. The ratings reflect Park’s balance sheet strength, which AM Best categorizes as strongest, as well as its strong operating performance, limited business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management. Park’s strongest risk-adjusted capital position reflects its conservative loss reserving practices and favorable development trends, along with its conservative investment portfolio and strong liquidity measures. Park is well-capitalized through retained earnings, as the captive has reported consistently favorable pure loss ratios in combination with its low-cost underwriting expense structure to produce favorable operating earnings year after year that have outperformed the commercial property composite by a wide margin. The ratings further reflect Park’s sophisticated risk management strategy and practices, experienced management team and its integral role as a single-parent captive of JPMorgan Chase Holdings, LLC, which is a subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPMorgan Chase) [NYSE: JPM], a leading global financial services group; however, Park’s business profile is considered limited due to its product concentration risk, offering limited lines of coverage on a net basis. Partially offsetting these factors are the tempered surplus growth as a result of capital returned to its parent in the form of periodic stockholder dividends and its large underwriting risk appetite on a gross basis. The potential credit risk associated with Park’s extensive use of reinsurance, which management utilizes to mitigate its exposure to oversized losses on substantially valued insured locations, as well as its reliance on the protection afforded by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act, are also offsetting factors. Park provides JPMorgan Chase with global property coverages, including terrorism, as well as bankers blanket bond, and prior to 2017, general liability coverage. These coverages are key components of JPMorgan Chase’s risk management strategy, and Park benefits from the explicit support of the group’s significant financial resources and extensive professional resources. AM Best remains the leading rating agency of alternative risk transfer entities, with more than 200 such vehicles rated in the United States and throughout the world.

Using the Chase brand, the bank will provide products and features tailored to meet the needs of customers in the U.K., delivered via an innovative mobile app. “We are bringing Chase to the U.K. because we want to provide customers with a new banking choice – one that will enable them to benefit from a simple and exceptional banking experience, built on the significant capabilities of JPMorgan Chase,” said Gordon Smith, CEO of Consumer & Community Banking and co-President of JPMorgan Chase. “The U.K. has a vibrant and highly competitive consumer banking marketplace, which is why we’ve designed the bank from scratch to specifically meet the needs of customers here.” Sanoke Viswanathan has been appointed CEO of the digital bank having previously been Chief Administrative Officer and Head of Strategy at J.P. Morgan’s Corporate & Investment Bank. The digital bank is headquartered at Canary Wharf, London, and its customers will be served by a purpose-built customer contact centre in Edinburgh. The business has already created 400 jobs in the U.K., and has more hires planned as it grows. A U.K. based subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase is licensed to operate the business. Its activities are regulated by both the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority. Chase has a unique opportunity to make a difference for U.K. consumers, by combining the reassurance of an established and trusted bank with a seamless customer experience. The bank intends to offer a range of products starting with a new take on current accounts. Chase’s U.K.-based customer contact centre will be central to the proposition, providing fast to access, personalised service around the clock. The offering is currently being piloted in an internal testing phase, prior to public release. “Our decision to launch a digital retail bank in the U.K. is a milestone, introducing British consumers to our retail products for the first time,” said Daniel Pinto, JPMorgan Chase’s London-based co-President. “This new endeavour underscores our commitment to a country where we have deep roots, thousands of employees and offices established for over 160 years.” When considering entry into the U.K., the firm conducted extensive research to identify where it could make an impact for consumers and meet their needs. Even as digital banking has become mainstream, the bank found that the stability and trustworthiness of the banking provider remains a key consideration for consumers. In the United States, Chase is one of the largest consumer banks serving nearly half of the country’s households, including 55 million digitally active customers. It offers a broad range of consumer banking products and holds several number-one positions including in deposit taking, digital banking and credit card issuance.

    "text": "LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Wie JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) heute bekannt gab, wird das Unternehmen Privatkunden in Großbritannien in den kommenden Monaten mit der Einführung einer digitalen Privatkundenbank eine völlig neue Banklösung anbieten. Unter der Marke „Chase“ wird die Bank Produkte und Funktionen anbieten, die auf die Bedürfnisse der Kunden in Großbritannien zugeschnitten sind. Diese werden über eine innovative mobile App bereitgestellt. „Wir von Chase siedeln uns in Großbritannien an, weil wir unseren Kunden ein neues Bankangebot unterbreiten möchten, das es ihnen ermöglicht, einen einfach zu handhabenden, außergewöhnlichen Bankservice zu nutzen, der auf dem bedeutenden Leistungsvermögen von JPMorgan Chase basiert“, so Gordon Smith, CEO des Unternehmensbereichs Consumer & Community Banking und Co-President von JPMorgan Chase. „In Großbritannien ist das Privatkundengeschäft im Banksektor ein dynamischer, hart umkämpfter Markt. Deshalb haben wir diese Bank von Grund auf neu konzipiert, um sie speziell auf die Bedürfnisse der hiesigen Kunden zuzuschneiden.“ Sanoke Viswanathan wurde zum CEO der neuen digitalen Bank ernannt. Zuvor war er als Chief Administrative Officer und Head of Strategy bei der Unternehmenskunden- und Investmentbank von JP Morgan tätig. Die digitale Bank hat ihren Hauptsitz im Londoner Geschäftsviertel Canary Wharf. Ihre Kunden werden von einem eigens dafür gegründeten Kundenkontaktcenter im schottischen Edinburgh betreut. Das Unternehmen hat bereits 400 Stellen in Großbritannien geschaffen und plant mit dem Wachstum der Bank weitere Einstellungen. Ein in Großbritannien ansässiges Tochterunternehmen von JPMorgan Chase besitzt die Lizenz für den Betrieb der Bank. Seine Aktivitäten werden von der britischen Aufsichtsbehörde Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) und von der britischen Finanzmarktaufsichtsbehörde Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) reguliert. Chase steht vor der einmaligen Chance, britischen Verbrauchern einen höheren Mehrwert zu bieten, indem das Unternehmen die Sicherheit einer etablierten, vertrauenswürdigen Bank mit einem nahtlosen Kundenservice kombiniert. Die Bank beabsichtigt, vielfältige Produkte anzubieten. Zunächst soll ein neues Konzept für Girokonten vorgestellt werden. Das in Großbritannien ansässige Kundenkontaktcenter von Case wird eine entscheidende Rolle einnehmen sowie einen schnellen Zugriff und persönlichen Service rund um die Uhr anbieten. Bevor das Angebot der Öffentlichkeit bereitgestellt wird, wird es derzeit in einer internen Pilotphase getestet. „Unsere Entscheidung, eine digitale Privatkundenbank in Großbritannien zu gründen, ist von großer Bedeutung und stellt dem britischen Verbraucher zum ersten Mal unsere Privatkundenprodukte zur Verfügung“, so Daniel Pinto, der in London ansässige Co-President von JPMorgan Chase. „Dieses neue Vorhaben unterstreicht unser Engagement in einem Land, in dem wir tief verwurzelt sind, in dem Tausende von Mitarbeitern für uns tätig sind und in dem wir seit über 160 Jahren Niederlassungen betreiben.” Als das Unternehmen den Markteintritt in Großbritannien in Betracht zog, führte es umfangreiche Untersuchungen durch, um festzustellen, in welchen Bereichen es für die Verbraucher interessante Angebote machen und deren Bedürfnisse erfüllen kann. Auch wenn das digitale Banking mittlerweile Teil des Mainstreams ist, gelangte man bei der Bank zu der Erkenntnis, dass die Stabilität und die Vertrauenswürdigkeit des Bankanbieters für die Verbraucher nach wie vor eine wichtige Rolle spielen. In den USA ist Chase eine der größten Privatkundenbanken, die beinahe die Hälfte aller Haushalte des Landes bedient, darunter auch 55 Millionen digital aktive Kunden. Das Bankhaus bietet eine breite Palette von Bankprodukten für Privatkunden an und nimmt in mehreren Bereichen Spitzenpositionen ein, u. a. beim Einlagengeschäft, beim digitalen Banking und bei der Ausgabe von Kreditkarten. Über JPMorgan Chase JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) ist ein führender globaler Anbieter von Finanzdienstleistungen, der Niederlassungen in aller Welt unterhält und ein Vermögen im Umfang von 3,4 Billionen US-Dollar verwaltet. Das Unternehmen ist Marktführer in den Bereichen Investmentbanking, Finanzdienstleistungen für Verbraucher, Bankdienstleistungen für kleine und mittlere Unternehmen und Handelsfirmen, Abwicklung von Finanztransaktionen und Vermögensverwaltung.
