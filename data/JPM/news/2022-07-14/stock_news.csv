As the Steel-level Supporting Partner of StartOut and co-lead sponsor of Growth Lab, J.P. Morgan is proud to help launch Cohort 10 and continue to empower LGBTQ+ business owners nationwide. “LGBTQ+ entrepreneurs represent one of the most innovative and rapidly growing segments of our nation’s business community, and J.P. Morgan is proud to expand its support for StartOut in its mission to accelerate that growth,” said David Barbee, who leads JPMorgan Chase Commercial Banking’s LGBTQ+ initiatives. “We are excited to welcome Cohort 10 to the Growth Lab and know that their growth will catalyze solutions to some of the most pressing issues of the day, from the green economy to enhanced healthcare services and beyond.” The companies selected to join Cohort 10 are: Carbon Reform (Newark, DE): A manufacturer of modular carbon capture devices for commercial building ventilation systems that improve indoor air quality for occupants, create energy savings for building owners, and directly capture and permanently sequesters tons of CO2 annually CreatorUp Inc. (Los Angeles, CA): A global video production company that allows clients to instantly purchase custom content from more than 700 video solutions Global Policy Leadership Academy (West Hollywood, CA): An EdTech start-up that prepares professionals and civic leaders to advance solutions to societal challenges through the development of shared knowledge, best practices, and collaboration Glyphic Biotechnologies (New York, NY/Berkeley, CA): A biotech startup developing a first-of-its-kind, next-generation protein sequencer to transform the underlying engine of biomedical discovery to move beyond the decades-old technologies based on mass spectrometry and ELISAs Hydrus.ai (San Francisco, CA): A software company spearheading Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) operating systems for enterprise Innovare (Chicago, IL): An application to empower education leaders to use data strategically to positively impact students and communities Reya Health (London, Ontario): A digital platform for personalized contraceptive counseling SmartSuite Tech (Portland, OR): A productivity software company solving challenges in the business presentation industry to modernize speaking notes, workflow and presentation capabilities StayFi (New York, NY): The global leader in WiFi Marketing & Management services for short-term rentals Wise Assistant (Atlanta, GA): An all-in-one platform to help creators get their businesses off the ground with easy-to-use marketing and business tools “In partnership with our co-sponsor, J.P. Morgan, we are thrilled to kick-off Cohort 10 with this impressive group of innovators,” said Andres Wydler, Executive Director, StartOut. “The companies who have graduated from the Growth Lab continue to have a substantial impact on their communities. We can’t wait to help accelerate the growth of this next group of passionate entrepreneurs!” Continued Partnership J.P. Morgan’s co-sponsorship of the Growth Lab is an expansion of the firm’s ongoing relationship with StartOut and a part of its broader commitment to supporting LGBTQ+ entrepreneurs. In 2019, JPMorgan Chase sponsored StartOut’s Pride Economic Inclusion Index (SPEII), as part of the firm’s $150 million Small Business Forward initiative to invest in underserved entrepreneurs. In 2021, the firm’s Office of LGBT+ Affairs, which advances equity and inclusion for LGBTQ+ employees, customers, business partners and communities, announced an additional $500,000 commitment to expand the SPEII, which now provides near real-time, data-driven insights into the US entrepreneurial ecosystem. In addition to the Growth Lab and SPEII, J.P. Morgan provides mentorship for StartOut businesses and co-sponsors the Annual Equality Summit. “I am proud to further advance our support for StartOut, one of our strategic non-profit partners,” says Brad Baumoel, global head of the Office of LGBT+ Affairs. “Through this expanded partnership, we plan to elevate and create true equity for the next generation of LGBTQ+ entrepreneurs.” To learn more about the StartOut Growth Lab, including details on the application process for the next cohort, visit: startout.org/growth-lab.

JPM,2022-07-14,2022-06-30,2022-07-28,JPM,,2022-07-19 08:30:00,2022-07-19T08:30:00-04:00,2022-07-19,Morgan Health Announces New Investment in Centivo,"WASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Morgan Health, the JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) business unit focused on improving the quality, equity and affordability of employer-sponsored health care, announced a $30 million investment in Centivo, an innovative provider of health plans for self-insured employers built to address health care affordability for employees and their families. Centivo’s model is anchored around relationships with leading accountable care providers with a proven track record of delivering high-quality, cost-effective care. Centivo works to align incentives between these providers and self-funded employers through timely access to care, affordable and predictable costs and outcomes-based compensation for providers tied to quality and cost-effectiveness. Through this approach, employers can typically offer health benefit plan options that include free adult and pediatric primary care for all visits, no deductibles, predictable copays for all non-primary care, enhanced patient access and integrated virtual primary care. Among mid-size and large employers, Centivo’s typical client has saved 15 to 30 percent annually compared to traditional insurance models. In addition, members’ medical and pharmacy out-of-pocket cost has, on average, been reduced to less than $350 per person per year. These cost reductions have occurred all while increasing primary care utilization by more than 30 percent and strengthening quality through an advanced primary care-centered clinical model. Centivo members report high levels of satisfaction with overall affordability, cost predictability and care coordination. Morgan Health’s investment is part of an extended Series B-1 financing. This extension will support Centivo’s rapid growth and expansion amid increased demand from employers and employees. “There is a critical and growing need for employers to offer – and for employees to have access to – high quality and affordable health insurance options. Sky-high premiums, deductibles and out-of-pocket costs make coverage unaffordable for too many. Centivo’s model offers a technology-driven and innovative primary care platform that can respond to members’ health needs at every moment,” said Peter Scher, Vice Chairman of JPMorgan Chase, a member of the firm’s Operating Committee who oversees Morgan Health. Scher will join Centivo’s Board. “Centivo recognizes the importance of being an advocate and partner in members’ health care journey. Our strategic investment and long-term support will help accelerate Centivo’s efforts so more Americans with employer-sponsored insurance can benefit from affordable, high-quality primary and accountable care,” said Dan Mendelson, CEO of Morgan Health. Launched in 2019, Centivo has continued to expand its reach among self-insured employers and now has a market presence in 13 states. The company’s growing roster of clients include employers with as few as 51 employees as well as numerous Fortune 500 companies. “We are honored and proud to be among the initial group of Morgan Health’s strategic investments,” said Ashok Subramanian, CEO of Centivo. “Morgan Health and Centivo share a joint mission of restoring health care affordability and value for American workers through a greater emphasis on accountable care. This investment will further increase our ability to do so for more and more employers and their employees while continuing to enhance the simplicity and affordability of Centivo’s health plan for members and patients.” Morgan Health’s investment in Centivo follows its recent investments in Vera Whole Health, and subsequent investment in Castlight, Embold Health and a research collaboration with Kaiser Permanente. Morgan Health will continue to identify emerging and developing accountable care models with the goal of helping to scale and expand these offerings for JPMC’s employees and the more than 150 million Americans with employer-sponsored health insurance. About Morgan Health Morgan Health is a JPMorgan Chase business unit focused on improving employer-sponsored health care. Through its investments and the advancement of accountable care, Morgan Health is working to improve the quality, equity and affordability of employer-sponsored health care for JPMorgan Chase employees, their families and the U.S. health system.

Further, for employed individuals with low- and moderate-incomes, the high cost of care and insurance, including deductibles and out-of-pocket costs, forced many to forgo or delay necessary medical treatments. More than 150 million Americans depend on employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) for their health care. While the national focus on health inequities has centered on the U.S. population at large, the health status of ESI enrollees has not been well understood given historical data gaps and limitations in analyzing health outcomes across race, ethnicity and income. “These findings are a wake-up call for business leaders on the severe health disparities that exist across the country’s workforce,” said Dan Mendelson, Morgan Health CEO. “The business community has a responsibility to understand and recognize these disparities, and more importantly, act to eliminate them. This will require active engagement with health plans and providers to close gaps and improve health outcomes.” The Morgan Health-NORC analysis reflects the latest data on ESI enrollees from three nationally-representative, public surveys and national vital statistics records. The findings present an important snapshot of health outcomes and disparities prior to the onset of COVID-19. Some of the most significant disparities appear to be associated with income differences, while others vary by race and sexual orientation, even when controlling for other factors. Key Findings: The burden of chronic disease varies significantly across races with data revealing underdiagnosis of key conditions for certain patient populations. Blood pressure: 60.4 percent of Black enrollees, 40.7 percent of Asian enrollees and 44.2 percent of Hispanic enrollees had high blood pressure, compared to 46.0 percent of white enrollees. After adjusting for age and sex, Black enrollees were 16.7 percentage points more likely to have high blood pressure than white enrollees. Furthermore, Black enrollees were 15.6 percentage points more likely than white enrollees to have uncontrolled high blood pressure. Diabetes: Compared to white enrollees, Asian, Hispanic and Black enrollees were more likely to have diabetes by 6.9 percentage points, 5.6 percentage points, and 5.3 percentage points, respectively, after adjusting for age and sex. The rate of undiagnosed diabetes was approximately 3 percentage points higher for Asian, Hispanic and Black enrollees than white enrollees. Obesity: 42.8 percent of enrollees were classified as obese. After adjusting for age and sex, Black enrollees were more likely to be obese than white enrollees by 13.6 percentage points, while Asian enrollees were less likely to be obese than white employees by 26.2 percentage points. Blood pressure: 60.4 percent of Black enrollees, 40.7 percent of Asian enrollees and 44.2 percent of Hispanic enrollees had high blood pressure, compared to 46.0 percent of white enrollees.

Obesity: 42.8 percent of enrollees were classified as obese. After adjusting for age and sex, Black enrollees were more likely to be obese than white enrollees by 13.6 percentage points, while Asian enrollees were less likely to be obese than white employees by 26.2 percentage points. Widespread variation in Cesarean section (C-section) delivery rates among races reinforce persistent maternal health gaps within the ESI market. Studies have shown that C-section delivery can significantly reduce maternal morbidity and mortality in high-risk deliveries. However, when performed in low-risk situations, C-sections can increase the risk of infections and blood clots and may contribute to unnecessary postpartum complications including death. The analysis showed that 20.1 percent, 17.7 percent, and 17.0 percent of low-risk deliveries among Black, Asian and Hispanic enrollees, respectively, were performed via C-section, compared to a rate of 13.6 percent among white enrollees. After adjusting for differences in age, Black, Asian and Hispanic enrollees with low-risk pregnancies were more likely to undergo a C-section than their white counterparts by 6.5, 3.9, and 3.4 percentage points, respectively. The analysis showed that 20.1 percent, 17.7 percent, and 17.0 percent of low-risk deliveries among Black, Asian and Hispanic enrollees, respectively, were performed via C-section, compared to a rate of 13.6 percent among white enrollees. After adjusting for differences in age, Black, Asian and Hispanic enrollees with low-risk pregnancies were more likely to undergo a C-section than their white counterparts by 6.5, 3.9, and 3.4 percentage points, respectively. Behavioral health and substance use issues were prevalent among all enrollees, however, there were stark differences in severity of these issues and related outcomes for Lesbian, Gay or Bisexual enrollees. The overall rates of anxiety and depression within ESI were 13.3 percent, and 14.1 percent, respectively. After adjusting for age and sex, white enrollees were more likely than Black, Hispanic and Asian enrollees to experience serious psychological distress, by 2.0 percentage points, 1.8 percentage points, and 5.2 percentage points, respectively. The percent of Lesbian, Gay or Bisexual enrollees who reported serious psychological distress was 12.1 percentage points higher, the rate of anxiety was 16.6 percentage points higher and the rate of depression was 18.4 percentage points higher than for straight enrollees after adjusting for age and sex. 19.8 percent of enrollees used tobacco products (inclusive of smoking, vaping, chewing tobacco), 30.1 percent reported heavy alcohol use, and 18.8 percent used illicit drugs, such as marijuana, cocaine, crack, heroin, misuse of pain relievers, stimulants, and tranquilizers, to name a few. Heavy alcohol use was highest among Hispanic enrollees while illicit drug use was highest among white enrollees. The overall rates of anxiety and depression within ESI were 13.3 percent, and 14.1 percent, respectively. After adjusting for age and sex, white enrollees were more likely than Black, Hispanic and Asian enrollees to experience serious psychological distress, by 2.0 percentage points, 1.8 percentage points, and 5.2 percentage points, respectively. The percent of Lesbian, Gay or Bisexual enrollees who reported serious psychological distress was 12.1 percentage points higher, the rate of anxiety was 16.6 percentage points higher and the rate of depression was 18.4 percentage points higher than for straight enrollees after adjusting for age and sex. 19.8 percent of enrollees used tobacco products (inclusive of smoking, vaping, chewing tobacco), 30.1 percent reported heavy alcohol use, and 18.8 percent used illicit drugs, such as marijuana, cocaine, crack, heroin, misuse of pain relievers, stimulants, and tranquilizers, to name a few. Heavy alcohol use was highest among Hispanic enrollees while illicit drug use was highest among white enrollees. Despite perceptions around the robustness of coverage within ESI, enrollees experience significant barriers to accessing care, particularly for those of racial/ethnic minority backgrounds and individuals with low or modest incomes. Specifically, 6.9 percent of enrollees reported missing medical care due to cost, 9.8 percent reported missing prescriptions due to cost, and 11.9 percent reported difficulty paying medical bills. These numbers vary widely by income.

Morgan Survey Finds","SYDNEY--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Australian midsized businesses are facing challenges rooted in the current labour market, supply chain disruptions and rising prices; yet, in the face of these obstacles, almost all expect growth (94%) and feel confident their businesses will thrive (80%) in the next 12 months, according to J.P. Morgan’s inaugural Australia Business Leaders Outlook Survey released today. “Australian business leaders are finding ways to adapt to the evolving economic landscape,” said Annabelle Mooney, Head of Commercial Banking for Australia and New Zealand, J.P. Morgan. “In spite of headwinds, these midsize companies are primarily optimistic that growth is achievable and are well-positioned to navigate the challenges of today’s uncertain climate.” In a survey of more than 200 senior executives from Australian midsize companies, there is optimism for the year ahead and confidence in their companies’ ability to grow—reflecting higher expectations than their counterparts in the U.S., U.K., Germany and France, according to J.P. Morgan’s recent surveys. They also remain confident in the global and national economy (63%), despite ongoing challenges stemming from the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. The challenges they cited most included a tie between labour concerns (27%) and rising prices (27%), followed by supply chain issues (18%). Their optimistic outlook could in-part stem from the new federal government taking office. In fact, more than half (56%) of Australian business leaders expect the recent election to have a positive impact on their business and just 6% foresee a negative impact, while others remain neutral. “Despite the business environment appearing uncertain for the foreseeable future, we know the Australian business community is resilient and nimble,” said Robert Bedwell, Chief Executive Officer of Australia and New Zealand, J.P. Morgan. “We continue to see these organisations overcome volatility and keep pushing forward with their expectation of growth on the horizon.” Getting Creative to Tackle the Labour Shortage Even as optimism persists, most Australian business leaders (92%) cited feeling the effects of the current labour market as it continues to create obstacles for businesses across the country. As a result of the labour shortage, almost half of current employees (47%) are working more hours, and 44% of midsize businesses are seeing reduced sales/revenue. In the hopes of retaining and attracting top talent, Australian business leaders are implementing: Increased benefits (50%) Upskilling or training opportunities (48%) Flexibility for work location (43%) Flexible working hours (42%) Navigating Shifting Business Concerns, Seeking Growth Supply chain disruptions (36%) and rising prices (27%), including energy and commodity prices, are also among the top challenges facing Australian business leaders for the year ahead. To manage supply chain issues, business leaders are making adjustments to inventory and suppliers by strategically stockpiling (50%), replacing or stopping business with certain suppliers (49%), or increasing prices for goods and services (43%). Managing Impacts of the War in Ukraine While the war in Ukraine continues to be a concern across the globe, nearly half (44%) of Australian business leaders expect the conflict to severely impact their business. Of those who do expect to be impacted, nearly 9 in 10 (88%) believe the impact will continue through the end of the year and more than one-third expect to face supply chain issues (45%), higher energy prices (41%) and higher commodity prices (36%) as a result of the war. Elevating What Success Looks Like Through ESG With companies being held to a higher standard with regard to environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors, more than half (52%) of Australian business leaders expect corporate responsibility to be an increased focus area for their business in 2022. Fortunately, 44% of Australian businesses have a positive outlook on the global focus of ESG, because they believe they’re already meeting the requirements. Of the various ESG focus areas, social factors (43%), diversity, equity and inclusion (41%) and environmental factors (37%) were ranked as most important focus areas to their business strategy in the year ahead. Planning for Succession As Australian businesses prepare for the future, many (75%) are planning or considering a transfer of ownership–with over eight in ten (83%) expecting a complete transition within the next five years. For leaders aiming to transition their business, more than half (61%) plan to transfer it to family either through inheritance (28%), sale (26%) or as a gift (7%).
