Starting with Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, MD, JPMorgan Chase will award winning collaborations across six U.S. cities a total of $30 million in philanthropic commitments. When COVID-19 disrupted America’s economy, it exacerbated deep economic disparities faced by Black and Latina women.1 Over two million women left the labor force during the COVID crisis, and the unemployment rate for Black and Latina women remains persistently higher than the unemployment rates for White and Asian men and women.2 According to the JPMorgan Chase Institute, Black and Latina women were particularly vulnerable to the financial effects of the pandemic and saw differential impacts such as childcare responsibilities created by closed or virtual schools and day cares. For example, Black and Latina female-led households experienced the fastest depletion of their stimulus balance gains. “To help address the challenges faced by many Black and Latina women across the U.S., we are investing in collaborations, drawing on the strengths of public and private sectors, to develop and test innovative and sustainable solutions. We know taking on these monumental issues will require a diversity of perspectives, areas of expertise, and skills,” said Demetrios Marantis, Global Head of Corporate Responsibility, JPMorgan Chase & Co. “Nearly two years into the pandemic in the U.S., we have continued to lose ground on the longstanding economic disparities that have disproportionately impacted Black, Hispanic and Latino people, especially women.” These proposals will help drive solutions to support Black and Latina women who have been disproportionately impacted by the effects of COVID-19. Winning collaborations demonstrated significant experience improving outcomes for Black and Latina women, and offered timely and promising approaches to financial health and coaching, entrepreneurship, housing stability and career support. Winning proposals were selected both on the strength of their ideas and their potential to reach scale through policy and practice change. JPMorgan Chase will also work with national partners to support evaluation and facilitate a learning community among the six winners to enhance the long-term sustainability of their solutions, meet the changing needs of each community, and share learnings. Today’s announcement is part of JPMorgan Chase’s $30 billion racial equity commitment to drive economic inclusion and builds on the firm’s initiatives to invest in solutions to drive equitable growth and community-based strategies across the country. Five of the six collaborations are led by Black and Latina women. Today, the firm announced two of the winners: Advancing Early Education in Washington, D.C: In the Washington region, the majority of early childcare educators are Black and Latina women and only one-fifth of all early childhood educators in the Washington region have a bachelor’s degree. Educators with bachelor’s degrees have more access to promotions, and the overall average hourly wage for educators with a degree is higher than wages for educators without a degree.3 With JPMorgan Chase’s $5 million three-year commitment, Martha’s Table, LIFT-DC, Venture Philanthropy Partners+ Raise DC, American University, Trinity Washington University, and the Urban Institute are launching the Advancing Early Education Collaborative—a partnership to increase access to education, skills, and training opportunities, as well as wealth building and capacity building for early childhood educators and the centers that employ them. The Advancing Early Education Collaborative will: Expand access to postsecondary education through fully funded scholarships and certification opportunities; Provide services such as education and financial coaching, technology access, professional development, stipends for childcare and transportation, access to children’s clothing and professional attire, and access to healthy groceries for participants; Support early education providers by coordinating and centralizing costs such as information technology, billing services, human resources, professional development, healthcare and retirement benefits for staff. Prioritizing Black and Latina Women’s Economic Rise in Baltimore, MD: 66% of Black, Latino and Hispanic households in Baltimore meet the standard for liquid-asset poverty. The largest percentage of those experiencing poverty are women between 25 and 54, with 50% of this population also being cost-burdened renters.4 With JPMorgan Chase’s $5 million three-year commitment, Latino Economic Development Center of Washington, D.C., University of Maryland Baltimore’s Community Engagement Center, Black Women Build Baltimore, Baltimore D.C. Building Trades, Byte Back and Baltimore Community Lending will create a continuum of wealth building for Black and Latina women developers in West Baltimore. To do so, this collaborative will: Provide lines of credit and grants to Black and Latina women real estate developers in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods of Baltimore City to help eliminate barriers in real estate development and close the appraisal gap; Recruit Black and Latina women into construction apprenticeships by providing readiness training programs to prepare women to apply for, enter, and complete a building trades-registered apprenticeship; Establish a small business incubator program, including direct capital support and one-on-one coaching to meet women entrepreneur’s needs. Four additional winners will be announced in the coming weeks. Today’s announcement builds on JPMorgan Chase’s commitment to expanding opportunities for women around the world by supporting organizations like the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, Jeremiah Program, Capital Enterprise and SmartStart. This year’s investment in the six collaborations across the U.S. draws from lessons learned from previous competitions. Key factors that result in lasting change include: Shared priorities and a common understanding of goals; A powerful vision for the future shaped by deep community engagement; Strong leadership and collaboration among partners with resources to drive change; Data-driven and evidence-based approaches that accelerate progress advancing equity. About JPMorgan Chase’s $500 million commitment to drive growth In 2018, JPMorgan Chase created a $500 million five-year initiative that combines the firm’s lending capital, philanthropic capital and expertise to make investments in cities around the world. The program includes large scale commitments in cities where deeper investments are needed to drive inclusive growth, as well as a challenge to source innovative cross-sector solutions for U.S. cities. What started as the AdvancingCities Challenge launched in September 2018 has since attracted more than 600 proposals over three cycles; in 2021, we received more than 200 applications from nearly 80 communities across 34 states. Statements of Support Kim R. Ford, President & CEO of Martha’s Table: “Our work is driven by our belief that every Washingtonian deserves the opportunity to thrive. We are deeply grateful to the JPMorgan Chase and to our outstanding peers in the Advancing Early Education Collaborative for their partnership. Together, we will help foster a strong workforce of talented early educators as well as an educational system that reflects the true value of this critical profession.” Emi Reyes, Chief Executive Officer of Latino Economic Development Center: “For LEDC, our mission has always been to advance financial wealth in the Latino and underserved communities. LEDC also understands how Black and Latina women can impact our communities and serve as pillars if given the appropriate resources and tools. However, Black and Latina women are often left behind with heavy housing financial burdens or a lack of information and training. The pandemic has also disproportionately affected Black and Latina women and their financial equity. Thanks to JP Morgan Chase's three-year commitment, LEDC can continue to expand its mission in West Baltimore, decrease the wealth gap for Black and Latina women, and generate small business opportunities for all of these women and their ideas.\" About JPMorgan Chase JPMorgan Chase & Co.

These investments are drawn from critical lessons learned from the firm’s business growth and community investments in the Mid-Atlantic region over the past five years. Wards 7 & 8 in Washington D.C. and Baltimore, Maryland will each benefit from $20 million from the new commitment, while the remaining $35 million will be divided up across the region including to places such as Richmond, Virginia. This new commitment brings the firm’s total investments focused on Black, Hispanic, Latino and other underserved communities in the region to $125 million by 2025. Prior to the pandemic, almost one-fifth of the D.C. population was living in poverty. The racial wealth gap was eight times greater than the national average, with white households in D.C. having 81 times the wealth of Black households — and the pandemic has only widened the gap (Urban Institute). “Business must do its part to help solve challenges facing the customers and communities it serves,” said Peter Scher, Vice Chairman, JPMorgan Chase & Co “Addressing inequities requires concerted and sustained efforts by public and private sector partners that seek to build wealth for Communities of Color. This new commitment, along with what we’ve learned from growing our business and community support here, will hopefully be a model for others to follow and help create meaningful, lasting, and equitable change in the region.” Creating a More Equitable Greater Washington Region From the firm’s initial $10 million commitment, it has learned a number of lessons which will inform its business and philanthropic investments, collaboration with business and community partners and policy support going forward: 1) Regional collaboration is necessary to bridge the racial wealth divide 2) Invest in women of color, who are key drivers of household economic mobility 3) Change systems by removing embedded barriers through intentional and integrated investment, philanthropy and policy 4) Invest in diverse-led organizations and business that are “by and for” communities of color Some of the firm’s new philanthropic investments, which have been informed by these lessons, include support for an effort to connect women to wealth building opportunities, and a long-term affordable housing initiative that seeks to advance systems change. Connecting Women to Wealth-Building Opportunities in the Region As part of JPMorgan Chase’s annual competition to source innovative and sustainable ideas to advance equity in communities across the U.S., the firm sourced proposals for projects designed for and by Black and Latina women to address racial and gender wealth gaps. Two of the six winning collaborations are from Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, MD. Each collaboration has been awarded $5 million to advance and help source solutions for women who have been disproportionately impacted by the economic effects of COVID-19. Advancing Early Education Collaborative—In the Washington region, the majority of early childcare educators are Black and Latina women and only one-fifth of all early childhood educators in the Washington region have a bachelor’s degree. Educators with bachelor’s degrees have more access to promotions, and a higher average hourly wage (Urban Institute, 2018). With JPMorgan Chase’s $5 million three-year commitment, Martha’s Table, LIFT DC, Venture Philanthropy Partners, American University, and Trinity Washington University will launch the Advancing Early Education Collaborative—a partnership to increase access to education, skills, and training opportunities in the field of early education for Black and Latina women specifically in Wards 7 & 8 in D.C. POWER: Prioritizing Our Women’s Economic Rise Collaborative – 66% of Black and Latino Baltimore households meet the standard for liquid-asset poverty. The largest percentage of those experiencing poverty are women between 25 and 54, with 50% of this population also being cost-burdened renters. With JPMorgan Chase’s $5 million three-year commitment, Latino Economic Development Center of Washington D.C., University of Maryland Baltimore’s Community Engagement Center, Black Women Build Baltimore, Baltimore- D.C. Building Trades, Byte Back and Baltimore Community Lending will create a continuum of wealth building programs for Black and Latina women real estate developers in West Baltimore. Closing the Housing Affordability Gap By combining business, data, policy and philanthropic resources, the firm aims to improve housing affordability and stability as well as homeownership opportunities for Black, Latino and Hispanic households in the Greater-Washington area. JPMorgan Chase is supporting organizations that will create sustainable solutions. Parity Homes– Redlining, urban renewal, and eminent domain have decimated once thriving Black communities, limiting opportunities for Black households to generate wealth. With JPMorgan Chase’s $2 million three-year commitment, Parity Homes will scale its approach to sparking upfront demand for homeownership opportunities in neighborhoods experiencing hyper vacancy by creating pathways for existing residents and other social collectives to purchase homes together block-by-block as a means of community-building and wealth-building. Equal Justice Works – With JPMorgan Chase’s $1.5 million three-year commitment, Equal Justice Works will bring together a group of lawyers and community organizers (‘Fellows’) as part of its Housing Justice Program to increase access to high-quality legal services and tenant resources for low-income Black, Latino and Hispanic households and residents of public housing. Housing Justice Program Fellows will also engage in high impact litigation to support practices that protect the rights of tenants across Virginia. Coalition for Nonprofit Housing and Economic Development – With JPMorgan Chase’s $1.95 million three-year commitment, the Coalition for Nonprofit Housing and Economic Development will lead a multi-sector effort to help Black, Hispanic and Latino residents build wealth by increasing the supply of safe, affordable housing and building pathways for local ownership. This investment is part of the firm’s collaboration with the Center for Community Investment to support six cities to advance more equitable housing results. These commitments continue to be informed by recent progress and insights from the firm’s philanthropic work in the region since 2017, and through conversations with local community, government and business leaders in Washington D.C., Baltimore and Richmond. “We are focused, in Washington, D.C., on how we give more residents a fair shot and make our city’s prosperity more inclusive. Part of that work means bringing together public, private, and philanthropic partners to make strategic investments in the people and communities that need them most. And that’s what we’re doing here,” said Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser. “This investment from JPMorgan Chase, an investment in Black and Latina women, in early education, and in affordable housing, will give more families in D.C. the fair shot they deserve.” Tuesday’s announcement is part of JPMorgan Chase’s $30 billion racial equity commitment to advance economic inclusion and help close the racial wealth gap. JPMorgan Chase has been doing business in Greater Washington since 1999 and serves more than 2.3 million consumers and 94,000 business clients in the region. By the end of 2022, Chase is expected to open more than 70 branches from Baltimore to Richmond with 28% of branches in low to moderate income communities. About JPMorgan Chase JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Morgan Payments-activiteiten - dat mogelijkheden voor zakelijke thesauriediensten, handelsfinanciering, kaart- en handelaarsdiensten combineert - om een geïntegreerde betalingservaring te bieden aan klanten in de hele economie. Het bedrijf onthulde onlangs zijn merk voor MKB-betalingen, Chase Payment Solutions, in de VS en de strategische investering in Viva Wallet zal de weg vrijmaken voor de ontwikkeling van toekomstige internationale producten en diensten in het Europese MKB. “De strategische investering van J.P.

Morgan om wereldwijde en Europese klanten beter van dienst te zijn en volgt op de recente aankondiging van het bedrijf om een strategisch partnerschap aan te gaan met Volkswagen Financial Services AG, met plannen om een controlerend belang van bijna 75% te verwerven in het betalingsplatform van de autofabrikant, onderhevig aan wettelijke goedkeuringen.
