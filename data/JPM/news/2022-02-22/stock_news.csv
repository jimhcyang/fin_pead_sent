The research team demonstrated the ability of the newly developed QKD network to instantly detect and defend against eavesdroppers. It also studied the impact of realistic environmental factors on the quality of the quantum channel and used a QKD-secured optical channel to deploy and secure Liink by J.P. Morgan, the world's first bank-led, production-grade, peer-to-peer blockchain network. This is the first demonstration of QKD securing a mission-critical blockchain application in the industry. Under the leadership of JPMorgan Chase’s Future Lab for Applied Research and Engineering (FLARE) and Global Network Infrastructure teams, researchers from all three organizations collaborated to achieve the following notable results: A QKD channel was multiplexed on the same fiber as ultra-high bandwidth 800 Gbps optical channels for the first time and used to provide keys for encryption of the data stream. Co-existence of the quantum channel with two 800 Gbps and eight 100 Gbps channels was demonstrated for a 70km fiber, with a key rate sufficient to support up to 258 AES-256 encrypted channels at a key refresh rate of 1 key/sec. Operation of QKD and the ten high-bandwidth channels was demonstrated for distances up to 100km. The proof of concept network infrastructure relied on Toshiba’s Multiplexed QKD System, manufactured by Toshiba Europe at their Cambridge UK base, and Ciena’s Waveserver 5 platform, equipped with 800 Gbps optical-layer encryption and open APIs running over Ciena’s 6500 photonic solution. The tests were conducted in JPMorgan Chase’s fiber optic production simulation lab. “Security is paramount for JPMorgan Chase,” said Marco Pistoia, PhD, Distinguished Engineer and Head of the FLARE Research group, JPMorgan Chase. “This work comes at an important time as we continue to prepare for the introduction of production-quality quantum computers, which will change the security landscape of technologies like blockchain and cryptocurrency in the foreseeable future. We are proud to be at the front-end of developing QKD technology for real-world applications while partnering with industry leaders in the field, such as Toshiba and Ciena.” At this time, QKD is the only solution that has been mathematically proven to defend against a potential quantum computing-based attack, with security guarantees based on the laws of quantum physics. Steve Alexander, Chief Technology Officer, Ciena, added, “With more sensitive information being distributed across fiber-optic networks every day, robust encryption is of vital importance. As the quantum computing era approaches, research and development advances will continue to ensure the confidentiality of critical data as it travels over the network.” “Ciena has always pushed the boundaries of what is achievable with innovative network technology. We were the first to achieve 200 Gbps encryption, then first to obtain 400 Gbps. Now we are the first to offer 800 Gbps encryption to the industry. Working with forward-thinking companies like JPMorgan Chase and Toshiba is critical as we continue to build networking solutions to be more secure and efficient in supporting our digital world.” “Based on the success of this project we now have a proven and tested method for defending against quantum attacks on blockchain,” said Yasushi Kawakura, Vice President and General Manager Digital Solutions Division, Toshiba America, Inc. “Toshiba is proud to contribute our QKD technology to this first-of-its-kind solution.” Suresh Shetty, Distinguished Engineer and Head of Blockchain Engineering for Onyx by J.P. Morgan, shared, “We are excited to have demonstrated that QKD can effectively secure communications between the various nodes in the Liink network against future quantum attacks.” Read the full research paper here.

JPMorgan Chase’s commitments will support organizations working to scale innovative housing models such as single-family housing production to increase the supply of affordable housing and homeownership. These commitments are part of JPMorgan Chase’s firmwide effort to address the housing affordability gap by using the firm’s business, data, policy and philanthropic resources. Today’s announcement works alongside efforts in Chase’s Home Lending business to help drive change in the mortgage industry through: Hiring and expanding its presence within underserved communities; Enhancing products and services; Promoting increased diversity in the appraisal industry; Participating in policy reform Additionally, JPMorgan Chase’s PolicyCenter is advancing data-driven policy solutions to improve homeownership opportunities weakened by the pandemic. “Owning a home is a key factor to providing family stability and building generational wealth, but out of reach for far too many people, especially Black, Latino and Hispanic households,” said Abigail Suarez, Head of Neighborhood Development at JPMorgan Chase. “Today’s announcement will help address current barriers to homeownership and allow more families access to wealth building opportunities.” As a result of uneven access to homeownership, the homeownership disparity between White households and Black, Hispanic and Latino households continues to grow. Long-term financial instability, a supply gap in affordable homes for purchase, and rising home prices continue to decrease the number of Black, Hispanic and Latino individuals and families becoming homeowners, with many of these problems being exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic downturn. 1 These challenges are being addressed by the organizations receiving philanthropic commitments, including: Atlanta Neighborhood Development Partnership (ANDP): With JPMorgan Chase’s $2.5 million three-year commitment, ANDP will work to advance affordable housing and racial equity by: Scaling its single-family housing production model, Growing its Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) lending platform, Prioritizing risk-sharing business partnerships with smaller, locally-based Black-owned real estate firms. Center for Community Self-Help: With JPMorgan Chase’s $2.5 million three-year commitment Center for Community Self-Help will work in Charlotte, Chicago, Milwaukee, and other markets to increase access to homeownership by: Creating a 100% LTV and specialized mortgage product to address savings and debt-to-income challenges, Launching a Savings Account for Emergencies Program that operates like a mortgage reserve account. Grounded Solutions Network: With JPMorgan Chase’s $2 million three-year commitment, Grounded Solutions Network will work in Atlanta, Chicago, Houston and Minneapolis to advance affordable housing by: Increasing technical skills, production rates, and capacity of community land trusts and other nonprofit housing programs through shared equity program supports, Creating a shared-equity mortgage conversion approach through the BIPOC Homeownership Stabilization Program to help distressed homeowners remain in their homes, preserve equity already accrued and share in a portion of future appreciation. The Housing Partnership Network: With JPMorgan Chase’s $3 million three-year commitment, the Housing Partnership Network will work in cities across the U.S. to increase the supply of and access to affordable single-family homes by: Launching the Building Neighborhoods Fund to make flexible, equity-like capital available to develop, acquire and renovate new and existing single-family homes, Increasing the volume and velocity of mortgages to Black, Latino and Hispanic borrowers through a new Equitable Homeownership Collaborative, comprised of CDFIs committed to expanding access to homeownership. Parity Homes: With JPMorgan Chase’s $2 million three-year commitment, Parity Homes will scale its approach to sparking upfront demand for homeownership opportunities in West Baltimore neighborhoods experiencing hyper vacancy by: Creating pathways for existing residents and other social collectives to purchase homes together block-by-block as a means of community-building and wealth-building. “Innovation and scale are desperately needed to address the growing race-based homeownership gap and resulting wealth disparity,” said John O’Callaghan, Atlanta Neighborhood Development Partnership President and CEO. “This support from JPMorgan Chase will enable us to grow our model, deploy more capital through small, undercapitalized Black-owned real estate companies, and develop homes that provide affordable housing and generate critical wealth for families.” JPMorgan Chase will work with the Urban Institute to test and scale these innovations, including measuring impact and sharing insights with the housing industry to advance housing stability and affordability for Black, Hispanic and Latino households. “I am proud of Urban’s work with JPMorgan Chase to identify, assess, and expand these solutions,” said Urban Institute president Sarah Rosen Wartell. “I look forward to supporting the grantees as they advance innovations to address the nation’s housing affordability crisis and overcome homeownership barriers that have stifled opportunity for households of color.” Advancing Data Driven Policy Solutions Last year, the JPMorgan Chase PolicyCenter released data-driven policy recommendations to increase equitable access to stable, affordable and sustainable homeownership. These recommendations mirror the impact of the work being done by the organizations receiving philanthropic commitments. For example, the firm is supporting policies and industry practices that: Build on COVID-19 protections to effectively support homeowners experiencing income disruption; Expand funding to increase supply of affordable homes for purchase; Advance reforms to increase mortgage market liquidity and improve access to affordable sustainable mortgages that better serve Black, Hispanic, Latino and low-income borrowers; Advance fair housing and mitigate bias and discrimination in the home valuation process; Create potential pilots including those that evaluate establishing mortgage reserve accounts. These commitments are part of the firm’s $30 billion commitment to advance racial equity and drive an inclusive economic recovery that was announced in October 2020.
