Following the success of Chase’s introductory 12-month 1% cashback offer*, customers will be able to earn 1% cashback on all eligible everyday debit card spending for an additional 12 months after the expiry of their initial offer, as part of its new monthly cashback offer**. In addition, Chase will introduce interest on its current accounts for all new and existing customers, which is set to start in April. Customers will be able to earn 1% AER interest*** on all their current account balances, with no fees from Chase or minimum monthly deposits, and customers can pay-in as much as they like. Shaun Port, Managing Director for Everyday Banking at Chase, said: “We’re expanding our rewards programme so our customers can continue to enjoy cashback on their everyday debit card spending. At a time when everyone wants their money to work harder, the introduction of 1% interest on current accounts adds another way in which customers can be rewarded for banking with Chase.” Complementing its soon to be introduced interest on current accounts, and new monthly cashback offer, Chase also provides 5% AER interest**** on its round-up account which is used for small change round-ups. The Chase saver, which is linked to its current account, pays 3% AER*****. Customers can open multiple saver accounts and deposit up to £500,000, with no fees from Chase for accessing their money. New monthly cashback offer Chase’s 1% cashback on eligible everyday debit card spending was developed in line with U.K. consumer debit card spending habits so that customers could benefit from rewards on many of the things they already buy every day. That includes, but is not limited to groceries, travel, meals, entertainment, fashion, homewares, electronics, as well as flights and holidays. Customers can also earn cashback when they spend abroad, with no fees from Chase, and a highly competitive exchange rate. Under the monthly cashback offer - which is available to existing customers after the expiry of their initial 12 month offer - customers will need to pay in £500 to their Chase current account (excluding internal transfers) each month to qualify for cashback in the following month. Cashback will be capped at £15 per month. The new offer will come into effect for existing customers from 1 April 2023. Customers who are due to come to the end of their initial 1% cashback offer at the end of February or in March can continue to earn 1% cashback until the 31 March, so they can seamlessly take advantage of the new offer. New customers joining Chase will continue to enjoy its introductory 12-month 1% cashback offer on eligible everyday debit card spending, without needing to deposit into their Chase account. For customers joining Chase from 1 May, cashback will be capped at £15 per month. 1% interest on current account balances to be introduced Starting in April, Chase customers will be able to earn 1% AER interest on all of their current account balances, as the bank offers another way to help customers make more of their money.

Customers can set up multiple current accounts via the Chase app, each with a unique account number, which has been designed to make it easier for customers to manage their money in a way that works for them. *Cashback exceptions apply, available for first 12 months. **Qualification criteria, exceptions and T&Cs apply. ***1% AER/gross variable, paid monthly.

In addition to raising funds for children’s welfare and education, the Run was also a zero-waste event, which means that less than 10% of the waste generated during the event will end up as landfill waste. The event allowed participants to choose between a 5K or 10K race and offered additional categories less commonly found in venues like this – 50+ years of age and non-binary gender – leading the way in inclusive practices. “The J.P. Morgan Run is a flagship employee event for our India franchise. It is an annual celebration of our camaraderie, a time to take action towards our personal fitness and an opportunity to pledge our support to the firm’s philanthropic efforts to support child education and welfare,” said Deepak Mangla, CEO, JPMorgan Chase Corporate Centers in India and Philippines. This year’s theme, “Run Together,” was purposefully chosen to include employees across skill levels, from beginner to expert runners, and regardless of age and gender identification. Among the thousands who ran, there were first-time runners as well as experienced ones who have run ultra-marathons. The event was also a platform for celebrating human connections with employees pledging their support for causes that were close to their hearts with themes at display covering disability, LGBTQ+, veterans, women and intergenerational inclusion, sustainability, wellness, camaraderie, and community impact. The Run is supporting children’s education and welfare through its long-term partner United Way Mumbai. It will also support animal welfare as a cause through partnership with YODA, CARE and People for Animals.

The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable. The ratings reflect Park’s balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as very strong, as well as its strong operating performance, limited business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management. Park’s strongest level of risk-adjusted capitalization, as measured by Best’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR), reflects its conservative loss reserving practices and favorable development trends, along with its conservative investment portfolio and strong liquidity measures. Park is well-capitalized through retained earnings, as the captive has reported consistently favorable pure loss ratios in combination with its low-cost underwriting expense structure to produce favorable operating earnings year after year, which have outperformed the commercial property composite by a wide margin. The ratings further reflect Park’s sophisticated risk management strategy and practices, experienced management team and its integral role as a single-parent captive of JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC, which is a subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPMorgan Chase) [NYSE: JPM], a leading global financial services group; however, Park’s business profile is considered limited due to its product concentration risk, offering limited lines of coverage on a net basis. Partially offsetting these factors are the potential credit risk associated with Park’s extensive use of reinsurance, which management utilizes to mitigate its exposure to oversized losses on substantially valued insured locations, as well as its reliance on the protection afforded by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act. Park provides JPMorgan Chase with global property coverages, including terrorism, cyber and bankers blanket bond. These coverages are key components of JPMorgan Chase’s risk management strategy, and Park benefits from the explicit support of the group’s significant financial resources and extensive professional resources. AM Best remains the leading rating agency of alternative risk transfer entities, with more than 200 such vehicles rated in the United States and throughout the world.
