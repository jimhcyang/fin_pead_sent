NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--In a year filled with unforeseen and unparalleled challenges, small and midsize U.S. business leaders are showing resilience by remaining nimble, accelerating digital adoption and using lessons learned to plan for continued economic uncertainty, according to the annual JPMorgan Chase Business Leaders Outlook survey released today. While the majority of businesses surveyed cited continued economic uncertainty as their top challenge, most – 77% and 63% of midsize and small businesses, respectively – remain optimistic about their own performance in the year ahead, even as they continue to face the impacts of a global pandemic. Still, fewer small businesses anticipate revenue and sales growth for the year ahead, down to 47% from 60% last year. The outlook for midsize businesses is a bit brighter: 69% expect to see revenue and sales growth in 2021, relatively unchanged from 70% a year earlier and before the start of the pandemic. “Businesses have weathered many storms over the past year, displaying impressive levels of creativity and adaptability as they shifted to new operating models, distribution channels and technologies,” said Jim Glassman, head economist, JPMorgan Chase Commercial Banking. “The challenges aren’t over, but their tenacity has helped sustain economic momentum and offers optimism for recovery in 2021.” Meeting Changing Realities: Businesses responded to 2020’s economic realities by rapidly adapting their operating models and strategies to maintain success in the new environment, including: Shifting to Remote Work: The majority of midsize (84%) and small (72%) businesses have moved some or all of their workforce to remote work over the past year. Building up Cash Buffers: Nearly two-thirds (65%) of midsize businesses and one-third (31%) of small businesses have increased cash reserves as a cushion for potential future disruptions, with 33% of small businesses expecting to save more in 2021. Digitizing Payments: More than half (56%) of midsize businesses have increased their usage of online banking and treasury tools, including electronic payments. Small businesses have moved towards contactless payment options, with 23% already implementing them and another 20% expecting to do so in 2021. Over one in 10 small businesses (14%) have changed their business model to have 100% of sales come from e-commerce in 2020, with 12% planning to do so in the year ahead. Identifying new Paths to Capital: Nearly half (44%) of small businesses have explored online lending in the past year, with 25% procuring an online loan. For the upcoming year, 56% say they would be open to procuring an online loan if they find themselves in need of capital. “Businesses were forced to make new and unexpected pivots last year, including accelerating their adoption of new processes, technology and contingency plans,” said John Simmons, head of Middle Market Banking & Specialized Industries at JPMorgan Chase. “Companies best positioned for success in 2021 will be those that focus on remaining nimble amidst continued volatility and evolving consumer demands.” Facing the Unknown: COVID-19 and the disruptions it’s caused have created a backdrop of economic uncertainty, which 61% of midsize and 47% of small businesses listed as the top challenge they’re facing. Generating sales and revenue growth remains a key challenge for midsize and small businesses, with 42% of midsize and 34% of small business leaders citing it as a concern. Amid economic uncertainty, employment projections declined modestly compared to previous years: 45% of midsize businesses and 34% of small businesses expect to increase full-time personnel in the next year. A limited supply of qualified candidates remains the top challenge to hiring for midsize businesses and is increasingly becoming a major concern for small businesses. Fighting Fraud: Nearly all (96%) of midsize and two-thirds (66%) of small businesses report taking actions in preparation for potential cyberattacks. Across both midsize and small businesses, employee education and training programs mark the most widely used tactic. More than half (55%) of midsize businesses report developing proactive counter measures, such as deploying technology against potential cyber-related disruptions, up from 47% a year before. Defining New Values: In addition to operational shifts, 47% of small business leaders say their core business values have changed since the start of the pandemic. The most common shifts include placing a greater value on their community, relationships with employees and digital solutions for their businesses. “Like many of us, the events of the past year have shaped many small business owners’ perspectives about what’s most meaningful to them,” said Business Banking CEO Jennifer Roberts. “Business leaders have a deeper appreciation for quality time with family and friends, and the importance of good health for themselves, their employees, and their community. These are likely to be permanent mindset shifts.” Planning For the New Year: Businesses should keep in mind the following considerations as they prepare for 2021: For more information on the Business Leaders Outlook, please view the midsize and small business reports. Survey Methodology JPMorgan Chase’s Business Leaders Outlook survey was conducted online from November 11-24, 2020, for small businesses (annual revenues between $100,000 and $20 million) and from November 13 to December 1, 2020, for middle market companies (annual revenues between $20 million and $500 million). In total, more than 2,100 business leaders in various industries across the U.S. participated in the survey.

OLDWICK, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--AM Best has affirmed the Financial Strength Rating of A (Excellent) and the Long-Term Issuer Credit Rating of “a” of Park Assurance Company (Park) (Colchester, VT). The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable. The ratings reflect Park’s balance sheet strength, which AM Best categorizes as strongest, as well as its strong operating performance, limited business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management. Park’s strongest risk-adjusted capital position reflects its conservative loss reserving practices and favorable development trends, along with its conservative investment portfolio and strong liquidity measures. Park is well-capitalized through retained earnings, as the captive has reported consistently favorable pure loss ratios in combination with its low-cost underwriting expense structure to produce favorable operating earnings year after year that have outperformed the commercial property composite by a wide margin. The ratings further reflect Park’s sophisticated risk management strategy and practices, experienced management team and its integral role as a single-parent captive of JPMorgan Chase Holdings, LLC, which is a subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPMorgan Chase) [NYSE: JPM], a leading global financial services group; however, Park’s business profile is considered limited due to its product concentration risk, offering limited lines of coverage on a net basis. Partially offsetting these factors are the tempered surplus growth as a result of capital returned to its parent in the form of periodic stockholder dividends and its large underwriting risk appetite on a gross basis. The potential credit risk associated with Park’s extensive use of reinsurance, which management utilizes to mitigate its exposure to oversized losses on substantially valued insured locations, as well as its reliance on the protection afforded by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act, are also offsetting factors. Park provides JPMorgan Chase with global property coverages, including terrorism, as well as bankers blanket bond, and prior to 2017, general liability coverage. These coverages are key components of JPMorgan Chase’s risk management strategy, and Park benefits from the explicit support of the group’s significant financial resources and extensive professional resources. AM Best remains the leading rating agency of alternative risk transfer entities, with more than 200 such vehicles rated in the United States and throughout the world.

LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Wie JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) heute bekannt gab, wird das Unternehmen Privatkunden in Großbritannien in den kommenden Monaten mit der Einführung einer digitalen Privatkundenbank eine völlig neue Banklösung anbieten. Unter der Marke „Chase“ wird die Bank Produkte und Funktionen anbieten, die auf die Bedürfnisse der Kunden in Großbritannien zugeschnitten sind. Diese werden über eine innovative mobile App bereitgestellt. „Wir von Chase siedeln uns in Großbritannien an, weil wir unseren Kunden ein neues Bankangebot unterbreiten möchten, das es ihnen ermöglicht, einen einfach zu handhabenden, außergewöhnlichen Bankservice zu nutzen, der auf dem bedeutenden Leistungsvermögen von JPMorgan Chase basiert“, so Gordon Smith, CEO des Unternehmensbereichs Consumer & Community Banking und Co-President von JPMorgan Chase. „In Großbritannien ist das Privatkundengeschäft im Banksektor ein dynamischer, hart umkämpfter Markt. Deshalb haben wir diese Bank von Grund auf neu konzipiert, um sie speziell auf die Bedürfnisse der hiesigen Kunden zuzuschneiden.“ Sanoke Viswanathan wurde zum CEO der neuen digitalen Bank ernannt. Zuvor war er als Chief Administrative Officer und Head of Strategy bei der Unternehmenskunden- und Investmentbank von JP Morgan tätig. Die digitale Bank hat ihren Hauptsitz im Londoner Geschäftsviertel Canary Wharf. Ihre Kunden werden von einem eigens dafür gegründeten Kundenkontaktcenter im schottischen Edinburgh betreut. Das Unternehmen hat bereits 400 Stellen in Großbritannien geschaffen und plant mit dem Wachstum der Bank weitere Einstellungen. Ein in Großbritannien ansässiges Tochterunternehmen von JPMorgan Chase besitzt die Lizenz für den Betrieb der Bank. Seine Aktivitäten werden von der britischen Aufsichtsbehörde Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) und von der britischen Finanzmarktaufsichtsbehörde Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) reguliert. Chase steht vor der einmaligen Chance, britischen Verbrauchern einen höheren Mehrwert zu bieten, indem das Unternehmen die Sicherheit einer etablierten, vertrauenswürdigen Bank mit einem nahtlosen Kundenservice kombiniert. Die Bank beabsichtigt, vielfältige Produkte anzubieten. Zunächst soll ein neues Konzept für Girokonten vorgestellt werden. Das in Großbritannien ansässige Kundenkontaktcenter von Case wird eine entscheidende Rolle einnehmen sowie einen schnellen Zugriff und persönlichen Service rund um die Uhr anbieten. Bevor das Angebot der Öffentlichkeit bereitgestellt wird, wird es derzeit in einer internen Pilotphase getestet. „Unsere Entscheidung, eine digitale Privatkundenbank in Großbritannien zu gründen, ist von großer Bedeutung und stellt dem britischen Verbraucher zum ersten Mal unsere Privatkundenprodukte zur Verfügung“, so Daniel Pinto, der in London ansässige Co-President von JPMorgan Chase. „Dieses neue Vorhaben unterstreicht unser Engagement in einem Land, in dem wir tief verwurzelt sind, in dem Tausende von Mitarbeitern für uns tätig sind und in dem wir seit über 160 Jahren Niederlassungen betreiben.” Als das Unternehmen den Markteintritt in Großbritannien in Betracht zog, führte es umfangreiche Untersuchungen durch, um festzustellen, in welchen Bereichen es für die Verbraucher interessante Angebote machen und deren Bedürfnisse erfüllen kann. Auch wenn das digitale Banking mittlerweile Teil des Mainstreams ist, gelangte man bei der Bank zu der Erkenntnis, dass die Stabilität und die Vertrauenswürdigkeit des Bankanbieters für die Verbraucher nach wie vor eine wichtige Rolle spielen. In den USA ist Chase eine der größten Privatkundenbanken, die beinahe die Hälfte aller Haushalte des Landes bedient, darunter auch 55 Millionen digital aktive Kunden. Das Bankhaus bietet eine breite Palette von Bankprodukten für Privatkunden an und nimmt in mehreren Bereichen Spitzenpositionen ein, u. a. beim Einlagengeschäft, beim digitalen Banking und bei der Ausgabe von Kreditkarten. Über JPMorgan Chase JPMorgan Chase & Co.

WILMINGTON, Del.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, Chase released the findings from a new study around consumer habits related to recurring payments. The results indicate that consumers increasingly rely on recurring credit card payments, care about knowing where their credit cards are digitally stored, and remain focused on getting a better handle on their finances. Chase credit cardmembers now have new tools to help provide a clearer picture of where their payment information is stored across various online touchpoints. “We are all leading more digital lives. Spending is changing and people want to be able to go from cart to complete in one click,” said Abeer Bhatia, President of Marketing, Growth and Innovation, at Chase. “We know recurring payments and subscriptions can make life easier. We want our customers to understand how money flows in and out of their account each month, as well as provide the tools to help them better manage their finances and the new world of digital money management.” Chase credit cardmembers can now log into their account online or via the Chase Mobile app, select a card, and see where they’ve saved credit card information online and in digital wallets. By providing greater transparency and control, cardmembers can manage their finances all in one place. Credit Card Control—track where credit card information has been used online for payments and where merchants are storing it for future transactions A Clear Picture—view and manage where credit card information is stored across online touchpoints Recurring Payment Management—monitor monthly payments and receive notifications if there is an irregular charge Credit Card Clarity—see which businesses recently saved payment information and update card details with a quick tap in the Chase Mobile app; this provides an opportunity to review or delete credit card information merchants are retaining Key survey findings include: Consumers Need Recurring Payment Awareness and Accessibility Today, the swipe, dip or tap of a card and the “Add To Cart” button can make spending feel effortless. However, consumers want to be savvier and better understand how recurring purchases impact their monthly balances. Sixty percent of respondents have forgotten about at least one recurring payment Three-Quarters (71%) of respondents estimate they waste more than $50 each month, which can impact monthly balances and support expenses that are simply no longer needed Recurring Payments are Here to Stay Almost every online purchase offers an opportunity to add a credit card for future or recurring payments. What was once a couple of clicks, can now be done with one touch. However, these payments may lead to confusion over what cardmembers are actually spending each month. Seventy-eight percent of respondents have a minimum of one recurring charge on their cards each month; 40% have between three and five. Cardmembers crave simplicity and frictionless payment options when given the choice. Almost 70% of consumers note that recurring payments can make it easier to manage and track their money. Conversely, 55% of respondents admit they don’t know how much is taken out each month in the form of recurring payments. Cardmembers Want More Context The survey further indicated that consumers want to know where their financial information lives online, including where their credit cards are stored. Sixty percent believe that if they know where their card is stored, it will help them have a stronger grasp on their recurring payments and finances More than half (56%) say recurring payments are a hassle to track down and on average it takes about three months for them to cancel unneeded recurring payments Nearly all respondents (90%) note that it would be valuable to know where their card is stored at all times. Chase’s digital tools provide a clearer picture of overall finances and a foundational understanding of the short and long-term impact of recurring payments. Bhatia adds, “With this increased transparency, our goal is to provide another layer of visibility and peace of mind for customers. We will continue to add more innovative features to give customers even more control right within their accounts.” For more information on the new feature from Chase, please visit: https://www.chase.com/savedaccountmanager.

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, JPMorgan Chase Commercial Banking announced the new Green Economy specialized industry team, which will provide dedicated banking services and expertise to companies that produce environmentally-friendly goods and services or focus on environmental conservation. JPMorgan Chase Commercial Banking has named Brian Lehman as the Head of Green Economy. Lehman, who will build a dedicated team of bankers to serve the segment, has more than 20 years of client-facing experience and deep knowledge of sustainable finance. He most recently led the Diversified Financials team within Commercial Banking’s Financial Institutions Group. “The path to a more sustainable future heavily depends on our actions today,” said Brian Lehman, Commercial Banking’s Head of Green Economy. “At JPMorgan Chase, we’ve seen a growing number of clients and industries whose foundations are built upon reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Our Green Economy banking team will not only deliver industry-specific advice, solutions and services to help green enterprises grow, but will also use our leadership position to promote a more sustainable world.” The new Green Economy team will initially focus on four industry sectors: renewable energy, efficiency technology, sustainable finance, and agriculture and food technology. Leveraging the full breadth of JPMorgan Chase’s offerings across treasury, credit and investment banking, the Green Economy team will utilize their expertise to help clients address operational challenges and fuel the growth of green businesses at large. In addition to offering traditional banking services, the team will focus on providing community-minded financial solutions for clients, including green and environmental bonds. “Sustainability, including the need to address climate change, is important to JPMorgan Chase and many of our clients,” said Doug Petno, CEO of Commercial Banking at JPMorgan Chase. “We’re excited to launch our Green Economy team, which will expand our capabilities to meet the changing needs of our clients and support the growth of industries and companies that will help make the world a better place for us all.” The announcement of the new team builds upon JPMorgan Chase’s efforts to advance sustainable solutions, including the adoption of a Paris-aligned financing strategy in 2020 to help clients navigate the challenges and capitalize on the long-term economic and environmental benefits of transitioning to a lower-carbon world. Additionally, the firm committed to facilitating $200 billion in 2020 for transactions that support climate action and efforts to advance sustainable development.

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--JPMorgan Chase aims to finance and facilitate more than $2.5 trillion over 10 years – beginning this year through the end of 2030 - to advance long-term solutions that address climate change and contribute to sustainable development. The firm will bring together its capital and expertise to help clients, customers and communities address these vital issues. This long-term target complements the firm’s Paris-aligned financing strategy and will help accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy by encouraging actions that set a path for achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. The firm will share an update and additional information on its Paris-aligned strategy with the release of its annual ESG Report this May. Last year, the firm also established the J.P. Morgan Development Finance Institution (DFI) to grow the development finance activities undertaken by J.P. Morgan and attract additional investment to the emerging markets. The new 10-year effort announced today will further the DFI’s objective to promote economic and social development. “Climate change and inequality are two of the critical issues of our time, and these new efforts will help create sustainable economic development that leads to a greener planet and critical investments in underserved communities,” said Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase. “Business, government and policy leaders must work together to support long-term solutions that advance economic inclusion, bolster sustainable development and further the transition to a low-carbon economy. We are committed to doing our part."" Supporting Clean Energy and Sustainable Development The new $2.5 trillion effort will be focused on the following objectives: Green: $1 trillion for green initiatives that support climate action, with the goal of accelerating the deployment of solutions for cleaner sources of energy and facilitating the transition to a low-carbon economy. Since 2016, the firm has facilitated and financed nearly $210 billion towards green initiatives. To help clients navigate the challenges and the long-term benefits of this transition, the firm will continue to provide clients in the Corporate & Investment Bank and Commercial Banking with centralized access to sustainability-focused financing, research and advisory solutions through its Center for Carbon Transition. As part of its efforts, JPMorgan Chase Commercial Banking also recently launched a Green Economy specialized industry team. The team will initially focus on four sectors: Renewable Energy, Efficiency Technology, Sustainable Finance, and Agriculture and Food Technology.

As part of its efforts, JPMorgan Chase Commercial Banking also recently launched a Green Economy specialized industry team. The team will initially focus on four sectors: Renewable Energy, Efficiency Technology, Sustainable Finance, and Agriculture and Food Technology. Development Finance: The firm will finance and facilitate transactions that support socioeconomic development and quality of life in developing countries. By originating and structuring transactions with anticipated development impact, the firm will mobilize capital to advance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in emerging economies. Community Development: JPMorgan Chase will advance economic inclusion in developed markets. The firm will focus its efforts on small business financing, home lending and affordable housing, education and healthcare. This includes the firm’s recent $30 billion commitment to advance racial equity. “We believe that a contribution at this scale will have a significantly positive impact. As a company we commit to dedicating extensive time, expertise and focus to ongoing analysis and development of the role we play,” said Ashley Bacon, Chief Risk Officer, JPMorgan Chase. “It is necessary, but not sufficient that as financial institutions covering the whole economy, we play our part. We hope broader developments ranging from public policy to technological advancement will move us further towards a sustainable path.” Impact of Annual 2020 Target In 2020, JPMorgan Chase exceeded its annual sustainable development target and facilitated more than $220 billion in transactions, including more than $55 billion towards green initiatives. Examples include: Raising $230 million for Bloom Energy Corporation, which develops efficient energy generators used to dramatically reduce electricity costs and greenhouse gas emissions. Providing financing to support the development of ALLETE Clean Energy’s largest wind farm, which produces enough renewable energy to power about 114,000 homes; Helping structure the inaugural $198 million local currency tranche of the Republic of Uzbekistan’s sovereign issuance. Intended use of proceeds includes building 15 schools, constructing three health institutions, developing new transportation and utility infrastructure and funding social welfare programs to support women and children; and Committing $24.7 million in equity to the new construction of Old Colony, a 115-unit public housing project in South Boston. All the units will serve families at or below 60% of the Area Median Income (AMI), with 12 of the units reserved for families at or below 30% of the AMI. The new 10-year goal leverages the firm’s global reach, capital, data and resources across lines of business. The firm will look for opportunities to refine JPMorgan Chase’s methodology, just as it has done between its 2020 achievement and this new 10-year target. Our Approach to Measurement and Reporting JPMorgan Chase will share additional information about eligible business activity, how it measures qualified transactions and the results of its efforts. The firm’s 2020 ESG Report, which will be released in May 2021, will include more information on the firm’s 2020 effort. Additional detail will also be shared at that time that lays out criteria for eligible business activity that will count toward the new 10-year target, as well as the process for reviewing qualified transactions. Going forward, the firm intends to provide updates on progress in its annual ESG Report. Examples of eligible business activities may include financing efforts that support renewable energy, clean technology, waste management, conservation, green buildings, sustainable transportation, transactions that advance the United Nations SDGs, affordable housing and small business financing in low-to-moderate income communities.

COLUMBUS, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)--JPMorgan Chase announced today it is launching a community-based hiring model in Columbus to help remove barriers for qualified people with criminal backgrounds to secure employment at JPMorgan Chase. The firm also joined a group of 29 major employers and national organizations to launch the Second Chance Business Coalition (SCBC) as part of its commitment to give people with criminal backgrounds a second chance by supporting their reentry into the workforce, community and local economies. Based on lessons learned from its efforts in Chicago, JPMorgan Chase is launching new collaborations with Columbus-based non-profit organizations to further build an inclusive hiring pipeline for people with criminal backgrounds in the city, whose histories fit within industry regulatory guidelines. The firm is collaborating with Center for Employment Opportunities (CEO), Goodwill Columbus, Columbus Urban League and The Legal Aid Society of Columbus to provide these job seekers with key resources, such as legal services, job search support and mentorship. Since its launch, this firm’s proven Second Chance recruitment model has helped more people with criminal backgrounds get hired into the firm’s Chicago workforce. In Columbus, JPMorgan Chase will provide local partnering nonprofits with technical support to equip them with best-in-practice approaches to supporting jobseekers facing barriers to jobs because of their arrest or conviction histories. The organizations will collaborate with JPMorgan Chase recruiters to provide career coaching, mock interviews, resume building, skills assessments and wraparound services to help successfully recruit, hire, and retain people recruited through this effort. “Now more than ever, Central Ohio needs an economy that works for more people,” said Corrine Burger, Chief Control Officer and Columbus Location Leader for JPMorgan Chase. “Breaking down barriers to employment not only helps connect businesses with qualified workers, but also unlocks opportunity across the community and strengthens our region. When we create hiring practices and policies that give people a second chance at stable employment, we all win.” “A critical aspect of criminal justice reform is ensuring that people with past convictions have viable employment options, and pathways to economic mobility after incarceration. We are excited to join JPMorgan Chase and other partners to promote scalable inclusive hiring practices in Central Ohio,” said Christopher Walter, Chief External Affairs Officer, Center for Employment Opportunities. “JPMorgan Chase is proving that modernizing hiring practices benefits employers by providing them with access to this highly motivated, hard working and loyal workforce.” In addition, through the Second Chance Business Coalition, JPMorgan Chase will engage with other local employers committed to adopting and promoting Second Chance hiring policies by sharing best practices, insights and learnings. JPMorgan Chase’s hiring efforts in Columbus build on a range of actions the firm has taken to expand opportunities for individuals with criminal backgrounds to pursue careers within the firm, such as proactively “banning the box” on job applications and removing all questions about criminal backgrounds from job applications. As a result of these efforts, in 2020, over 2,100 people with criminal backgrounds were hired – approximately 10 percent of JPMorgan Chase’s new hires in the U.S. Many were involved in low-level crimes such as disorderly conduct, personal drug possession and DUI (driving under the influence), and are employed in jobs such as transaction processing, and lending and account servicing. Approximately 70 million Americans have a criminal record. Research shows that individuals with a conviction history often experience significant collateral consequences as a result, including barriers to employment and a lack of opportunities to advance professionally. For example, a criminal record alone can reduce the chances of a second interview by 50 percent. A Society for Human Resource Management study found that 82 percent of managers feel that the “quality of hire” for workers with criminal records is as high as or higher than that for workers without records. Policymakers and businesses increasingly recognize that providing education, skills training and employment opportunities to people with arrest or conviction histories helps reduce recidivism, increase public safety, build stronger communities and strengthen the economy. In addition to the firm’s hiring efforts in Columbus, the firm is taking several other actions to remove barriers to employment for people with criminal backgrounds: a. Public Policy Agenda: Through the JPMorgan Chase PolicyCenter, the firm has been developing and advancing sustainable, evidence-based policy solutions to help remove barriers to employment for people with criminal backgrounds. People with criminal records face economic barriers including hiring discrimination and lost job opportunities, as well as access to higher education or capital to start a business. The drag on the earning potential of tens of millions of Americans are costs not only borne by individuals, their families, and their communities, but also have large economic consequences that contribute to inequality. This disproportionately affects people of color, with Black adults being over five times more likely to be incarcerated than white adults. Examples of the firm’s work to create greater opportunity for people with records include: Reforming Industry Hiring Rules by working with the FDIC to modify Sec 19 rules for people with convictions for certain low-risk crimes to qualify for jobs in the banking industry without increasing risk to safety and soundness. Endorsing the Fair Chance Act, which was signed into federal law in December 2019 and helps qualified workers with arrest or conviction records compete for employment in federal agencies and with federal contractors. Supporting the restoration of access to Pell Grants for incarcerated individuals. Signed into federal law in 2020, this allows incarcerated individuals to pursue post-secondary education in prison, increasing employment opportunities after their release. Advancing bipartisan Clean Slate Automatic Record Clearing, including support for federal House and Senate measures, as well as state legislation to streamline the record clearing process for eligible offenses and help individuals move on from their records. In Michigan, for example, JPMorgan Chase supported a landmark bipartisan Clean Slate measure in 2020 that will automatically clear eligible records for roughly one million people across the state. Supporting the federal Driving for Opportunity Act and state measures which seek to limit driver’s license suspensions for unpaid fines and fees unrelated to driving infractions. b. Philanthropic Commitments: JPMorgan Chase is investing an additional $12.5 million to help community organizations in cities like Los Angeles, New York, Seattle, Chicago, Nashville and Delaware, connect people with criminal backgrounds with in-demand, well-paying jobs, the tools and resources they need to achieve their financial goals, and entrepreneurship training. The firm’s philanthropic commitments also include collaborations with organizations like the Financial Health Network, Cabrini Green Legal Aid, Safer Foundation, and the Center for Employment Opportunity to help provide people with arrest or conviction records with access to the resources that they need to advance their financial health, access legal advice and build in-demand skills for stable career pathways.

SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--StartOut today announced a $500,000 philanthropic commitment from JPMorgan Chase to expand on the organization’s StartOut Pride Economic Inclusion Index (SPEII) which provides near real-time, data-driven insights into the US entrepreneurial ecosystem. This Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) Impact Program will examine the effectiveness of various public policies by measuring LGBTQ+ and other underrepresented entrepreneurs’ economic impact in the US with respect to job creation, patents, financings and exits. The investment from JPMorgan Chase will help to highlight effective local, state and federal policies which can generate successful outcomes for these entrepreneurs. The project aims to guide the deployment of capital toward the most impactful policies, leveraging the foundational work already done on the SPEII. “The generous philanthropic investment from JPMorgan Chase will allow our project to gather even more comprehensive entrepreneurial data and thus expand the depth of our insights in terms of how best to achieve specific outcomes,” said Andres Wydler, StartOut’s executive director. This investment is part of JPMorgan Chase’s broader effort to advance equity for underserved communities. The program, originally developed in June 2019, is supported under JPMorgan Chase’s $350M Small Business Commitment to expand opportunities for underserved entrepreneurs. The initial SPEII that was jointly published with Socos Labs and quantified both the economic contributions and unrealized potential of LGBTQ+ entrepreneurs in near real-time. Data findings addressed the talent and resource gap with a goal of improving and supporting founders with diverse backgrounds. “We couldn’t be more pleased to advance our support for the Inclusion Impact Indexes, with one of our strategic non-profit partners, StartOut,” says Brad Baumoel, Global Head of LGBT+ Affairs at JPMorgan Chase. “This work aligns so well to our firmwide efforts to advance business growth and entrepreneurship for the LGBT+ Community.” Initial Inclusion Impact Indexes insights show that over the last 20 years, for example: More inclusive access to resources for LGBTQ+ entrepreneurs would have created over 400,000 additional jobs in the US, and 1.2 million additional jobs for female entrepreneurs. Less than half a percent of all US high-growth entrepreneurs publicly identify as LGBTQ+. $1 trillion in exits could have reached about $2 trillion if all entrepreneurs had been given equal access to resources. Women entrepreneurs raised $150 billion in funding while their potential was over $400 billion. Socos Lab’s co-founder Dr. Vivienne Ming added, “The Inclusion Impact Index uses big data analysis and a custom AI-driven engine to measure the contributions of entrepreneurs and then calculates what they could have achieved with equal access. Policies play an important role and we’re excited to examine their impact on a granular level, all the way to individual metropolitan areas.” StartOut values the continued pro bono support from Crunchbase and the many collaborators who are inviting their entrepreneurs to take part in the confidential survey. The list of collaborators is growing and includes 500 Startups, Aleria Research, Aspen Tech Policy Hub, AWS, Bunker Labs, FLIK, Global Entrepreneurship Network, Google for Startups, Halcyon, Impact Hub New York Metropolitan Area, NVCA/Venture Forward, KiwiTech, Nasdaq Entrepreneurial Center, Out Leadership, PayPal, PitchBook, Republic, Reaching Out MBA, Silicon Valley Bank, Social Venture Circle, TechCrunch, Techstars, US SEC Small Business Advocacy Team, Vets in Tech and many others. StartOut and their collaborators invite all entrepreneurs throughout the US to participate in this seminal DEI project and this survey. Participation is entirely voluntary, and all responses are held in confidentiality. Only aggregated, anonymized insights are shared publicly. Entrepreneurs in the US can easily complete the survey in 2-4 minutes and it can be accessed securely online at: https://bit.ly/3gSealD The StartOut Pride Economic Impact Index is publicly available for free to all at www.inclusionindexes.org or www.startout.org/speii.

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Chase and Tock today announced a new offer for Chase restaurant clients on Tock to support restaurant and hospitality small businesses as they recover from the pandemic.

Those already on Tock with a Chase business checking account linked will receive $1,200 to use towards subscription fees. The restaurant industry has been among the hardest hit by the COVID-19 crisis. As more local businesses quickly reopen, this new offer will help remove barriers including access to service tools and support small business growth. “In many ways, reopening is more difficult than the initial shock of the pandemic,” said Nick Kokonas, CEO of Tock. “Service industry businesses cannot just flip a light switch to scale operations. Tock and Chase want to help by not only making operations more efficient, but also by backing that up with cash.” “Restaurant owners and those in the hospitality business have inspired us over the past year with how quickly they’ve adapted to unprecedented challenges,” said Jennifer Roberts, CEO of Chase Business Banking. “With Tock, we are providing entrepreneurs with an all-in-one system to reach their customers online so that they can focus on what’s important - running their business. We love restaurants and want to do everything we can to support them as they recover.” To receive the Tock offer, eligible small business owners need to complete these steps by Dec. 31, 2021: 1.

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--As much of the country reopens nearly a year and a half since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S., midsize business leaders’ optimism about their industries and companies hit record highs, according to JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Business Leaders Outlook Pulse survey released today. Nearly 9 in 10 business leaders (88%) are optimistic about their company’s performance for the next six months, the highest percentage recorded in 11 years of the survey, and up from 56% one year ago at the height of the pandemic in the U.S. Survey participants are also feeling confident about the industry they’re in: 82% are optimistic about their industry’s performance, a significant jump from 45% a year ago. This rising confidence extends to the broader economy as well. Three-quarters of respondents are optimistic about the local (76%) and national economy (75%), each representing an increase of at least 40 percentage points from a year ago. Optimism about the global economy, which has traditionally been more muted, is at its highest level (53%) since 2018, up from just 17% last summer. The rosy outlook is driving ambitious growth plans for companies: the majority (80%) anticipate a rise in revenue/sales, and close to half (46%) expect to increase investments in capital expenditures, up from 18% one year ago. In line with these growth plans, nearly 4 in 10 businesses (38%) expect an increase in credit needs for the remainder of 2021. “After enduring the challenges of the last year and a half, businesses are feeling overwhelmingly positive about what’s ahead,” said Jim Glassman, head economist, JPMorgan Chase Commercial Banking. “The focus now is on navigating growing pains to harness the momentum of the economic recovery, which is comparatively a good problem to have.” Businesses’ Pandemic-Related Changes Are Here to Stay The disruptions brought on by the pandemic forced businesses to adapt quickly and evolve their business models, with some of these changes expected to be permanent. The top strategic actions business leaders have taken include: Introducing New Offerings: The majority (61%) have diversified and strengthened their offerings by delivering new product and service lines, with many planning to maintain these products and services post-pandemic. Digitizing Operations: 39% of businesses expanded their e-commerce capabilities as more customers shopped online, and 38% digitized their accounts payables and receivables processes to boost efficiency. Expanding Geographically: In addition to reaching customers via new digital channels, 38% of businesses expanded into new geographic markets. “Businesses are proving yet again that when put to the test, they adapt, innovate and rise to the occasion – and in many cases, become stronger and gain market share,” said John Simmons, head of Middle Market Banking & Specialized Industries, JPMorgan Chase Commercial Banking. “We’re working with our clients to help chart a path forward and lean into new opportunities, from digitizing manual back-office processes to evaluating strategic transactions like a merger or sale.” Supply Chain Issues Are a Top Challenge Businesses’ supply chains were hit particularly hard by the events of the past year and a half, and ongoing supply chain issues top the list of challenges for the year ahead. Companies report having to utilize new suppliers, digitize back-office functions and manage their supply chain remotely, with many of them planning to maintain these changes in the future. Other challenges cited by business leaders include uncertain economic conditions and sustaining revenue and sales growth. Businesses are also contending with the reality of a tight labor market as the large majority (81%) hope to hire more workers in the next six months, especially as large numbers of experienced Baby Boomers retire. Cybersecurity is also a growing concern, as one-third of companies report being directly impacted by a cyberattack or fraud since March 2020. Among the businesses that have experienced attacks, 79% say employee education and training has been the most helpful mitigation tactic, and 56% say proactive countermeasures, including deploying new technologies, have been beneficial. The New Workplace With pandemic-related restrictions recently lifted or modified in many parts of the country, businesses are reevaluating their working models. Thirty-eight percent expect all employees to return to on-site work, while one in four respondents (26%) are newly implementing a flexible working model. Of the businesses that are taking a flexible approach, preserving company culture is a top concern, followed by maintaining productivity levels. Looking Forward Companies should factor the following considerations into their business plans to position themselves for success in the year ahead: For more information on the 2021 Business Leaders Outlook Pulse survey, please visit jpmorgan.com/2021midyearoutlook.

WILMINGTON, Del.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Chase Sapphire®, in collaboration with restaurant discovery platform, The Infatuation, announces “Sapphire Supports Restaurants Contest,” an initiative that will give 20 grants of $50,000 each to small business restaurants across America to provide COVID-19 pandemic recovery assistance. Starting today, consumers can nominate their favorite local restaurant to be eligible to win one of 20 $50,000 grants. Contest entries are centered around a prompt asking diners across the country to share what their favorite local restaurant means to them, the role the restaurant plays in the community, and to describe the tenacity they’ve shown through the pandemic. “Small businesses and local restaurants are the heartbeat of our neighborhoods,” said Marleta Ross, General Manager of Chase Sapphire. “The past year has been challenging, especially for the smaller, local places that are some of our favorites. Sapphire wants to recognize these establishments, the people behind them and the service they provide for their communities and help them along in their recovery so they can keep doing what they do best.” Entries will be accepted through August 16, 2021 and will be reviewed by a panel of culinary industry insiders who will consider a variety of factors including the restaurant's impact to the community; their innovation or creativity during the pandemic; and the nominator's passion for the restaurant. There will be five winning restaurants from each of the four geographical regions across the U.S. Eligible restaurants must be located in the United States; have no more than two locations; no more than 50 full-time employees; and have been open prior to or as of March 1, 2020.

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--JPMorgan Chase today announced six organizations to receive philanthropic capital as part of the firm’s $400 million five-year commitment to improve housing affordability and stability for Black, Hispanic and Latino and other underserved households. These commitments and policy solutions are part of the firm’s $30 billion commitment to advance racial equity and help drive an inclusive economic recovery. JPMorgan Chase Institute research has shown almost one in four renters experienced a greater than 10 percent drop in total income during the pandemic, even after accounting for government support, but did not have a forbearance safety net like homeowners, creating economic vulnerabilities for both renters and landlords. Through JPMorgan Chase’s commitments, six organizations will design and test innovative models to improve household stability with the goal of expanding successful models across the U.S. This includes eviction prevention support, rental assistance, access to legal services and resources for small landlords. “Access to safe, affordable housing is key to building wealth but out of reach for far too many families,” said Heather Higginbottom, President, JPMorgan Chase PolicyCenter and Co-Head of Global Philanthropy. “Today’s announcement will help promote immediate housing stability for underserved households and is one step toward our goal of addressing barriers to affordable housing and homeownership, especially for Black, Latino and Hispanic families.” Organizations receiving philanthropic capital: Community Justice Project (Miami, FL) At least 31% of Florida renters could be at risk of eviction by the end of the year.1 With JPMorgan Chase’s $1.6 million three-year investment, Community Justice Project (CJP) will implement a community lawyering model supporting grassroots organizations and tenant-led campaigns to help stop evictions and improve conditions for renters. CJP aims to expand this model beyond Miami-Dade to eight other counties across Florida. Community Legal Services (Philadelphia, PA) During the pandemic, Philadelphia landlords filed to evict 4,500 tenants, disproportionately impacting Black, Latino and Hispanic communities, and the number of filings is expected to significantly increase as COVID-related tenant protections expire.2 With JPMorgan Chase’s $1.5 million three-year investment, Community Legal Services will expand its program design and build capacity to alter the eviction landscape in Philadelphia by combining the following three initiatives: eviction alternatives, right to counsel and eviction record screening protections. The COVID-19 Eviction Defense Project (Colorado) At least 25% of renters in Colorado could be at risk of eviction by the end of year.3 With JPMorgan Chase’s $1.3 million two-year investment, The COVID-19 Eviction Defense Project will support eviction prevention through a strategic model that provides tenants with resources for household stability such as rental assistance, negotiation services, legal services and rehousing placements. Equal Justice Works (Richmond, VA) Five of the top ten cities with the highest eviction rates in the United States are located in the Commonwealth of Virginia.4 With JPMorgan Chase’s $1.5 million three-year investment, Equal Justice Works will bring together a group of lawyers and community organizers (‘Fellows’) as part of its Housing Justice Program to increase access to high-quality legal services and tenant resources for low-income Black, Latino and Hispanic households and residents of public housing. Housing Justice Program Fellows will also engage in high impact litigation to support practices that protect the rights of tenants across Virginia. Neighborhood Housing Services of Chicago (Chicago, IL) In Illinois, 22% of Black renters and 17% of Hispanic and Latino renters are behind on their rent, compared to 9% of white renters.5 With JPMorgan Chase’s $1 million three-year investment, Neighborhood Housing Services of Chicago (NHS Chicago) will provide rental assistance and counseling to around 675 households. NHS Chicago will also support small-unit landlords through rental and mortgage assistance, housing mediation services, renter relocation grants, post-purchase counseling, financial assessments and foreclosure prevention support. Texas Housers (Houston, TX) In Texas, more than 800,000 low-income renter households compete for around 244,000 rental units that are affordable and available to them.6 With JPMorgan Chase’s $1.5 million three-year investment, Texas Housers will provide low-income tenants in Texas with access to resources and advice to help secure rental assistance and long-term affordable housing. This includes helping tenants understand government emergency rental assistance programs and how to protect their homes when facing eviction. The investment will also fund Texas Housers’s work to support and expand a statewide collaboration of tenants and supporters engaged in research and policy discussions to increase the supply of affordable rental housing and secure essential tenant protections at the state and local level. Advancing Data Driven Policy Solutions Recently, the JPMorgan Chase PolicyCenter released data-driven policy recommendations to improve household stability weakened by the pandemic. These recommendations mirror the work of the organizations receiving philanthropic commitments. For example, the firm is supporting policies that: Implement fair eviction standards to help ensure stability and improve outcomes for tenants and landlords; Reduce preventable evictions by establishing eviction diversion programs, applying eviction principles, such as right to counsel, that protect tenants from unlawful eviction and helping ensure a balanced and predictable eviction process; Expand access to homelessness and eviction prevention programs, as well as legal assistance services that help renters navigate their housing options and rights, emergency shelter, and rapid re-housing; and Standardize the collection and tracking, of state and local level eviction data to better inform policy decisions.

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--JPMorgan Chase released a Fact Sheet today to provide an update on its $30 Billion Racial Equity Commitment. The following is the Executive Summary. The full fact sheet is available online here. Executive Summary In October 2020, JPMorgan Chase announced the $30 Billion Racial Equity Commitment to help close the racial wealth gap among Black, Hispanic and Latino communities. The firm is bringing together its business, philanthropy, policy and data expertise to advance racial equity and drive inclusive growth. The five-year Commitment includes lending, equity and direct funding to help increase sustainable homeownership, expand affordable housing, grow small businesses, support diverse suppliers, improve financial health and access to banking and build a more diverse and inclusive workforce. The firm is building the infrastructure and foundation to make progress on its Racial Equity Commitment. With more work to do, below is a summary of progress. Moving forward, JPMorgan Chase plans to publish its progress annually in its Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) report starting in May 2022. Summary of Progress JPMorgan Chase has deployed or committed more than $13 billion of its $30 billion goal to help close the racial wealth gap. This is largely driven by homeownership refinance and affordable rental housing preservation, which were existing products and processes where the firm took prompt action to do more. While there is more work to do, below is an update on the Commitment. Mortgage Refinance: Given the historically low rate environment, the firm quickly helped homeowners save money on their monthly mortgage payments by refinancing 16,000 of the 20,000 incremental loans goal, $4 billion to date.1 Homeownership: Hired more than 130 Community Home Lending Advisors, expanded the homebuyer grant program to $5,000 in 6,700 minority neighborhoods nationwide and enhanced mortgage products to create better access to credit through pricing improvements and credit expansion. Affordable Rental Housing: Funded more than $6 billion in loans to help preserve more than 60,000 affordable housing and rental housing units across the U.S. Also approved lending of $1 billion for the new construction and rehabilitation of affordable housing for low- and moderate-income households. Grow Small Business: Hired more than 20 diverse senior business consultants to provide free one-on-one coaching for business owners in 13 U.S. cities and have mentored more than 900 small business owners so far. Financial Health: Helped customers open more than 200,000 low cost checking accounts with no overdraft fees. Opened nine Community Center branches and hired 72 Community Managers in underserved communities to build and nurture relationships with community leaders, nonprofit partners and small businesses. Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs) and Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs): Invested more than $100 million of equity in 14 diverse-owned or -led MDIs and CDFIs that serve more than 87 communities in 18 states and the District of Columbia. Workforce: Grew partnerships with Historically Black Colleges and Universities from 3 to 17 to deepen the firm’s recruiting partnerships, expand curriculum development, scholarships and mentorship programs. The firm pledged to hire 4,000 Black students by 2024. It has hired more than 3,800 Black students as interns, fellows and entry-level analysts and is on track to surpass the original goal. Philanthropy: Committed $128 million of its five-year, $2 billion philanthropic target, which includes grants, low cost loans and direct equity. The firm is on pace to allocate its full year target of more than $400 million by the end of the year. Additional Activities: The Racial Equity Commitment has been a catalyst for evolving how the firm does business and has inspired other activities and investments that go above and beyond the $30 billion. Some examples include creating an Empower money market share class, co-investing $200 million in Project Black, elevating DEI standards as part of its supply chain assessment and investing in the Appraiser Diversity Initiative. Visit jpmorganchase.com to learn more. Reporting and Governance: Established a robust reporting and governance process for consistent tracking of the $30 billion Commitment, which is run by the Community Impact organization. The Public Responsibility Committee (PRC) of the JPMorgan Chase Board of Directors provides oversight of this work and is briefed bimonthly on the firm’s progress. Next Steps Building on the hiring of community managers, community home lending advisors and small business consultants, the creation and enhancement of products, expansion of new branches in more communities and other efforts, the firm plans to take the following next steps. Homeownership: Continue prudently expanding FHA lending and supporting policy reforms to the FHA program, including servicing standards. Affordable Rental Housing: Explore innovative financing solutions and work with new public resources to support the development of vital community facilities and new housing for individuals and families earning a wider range of incomes than conventional projects serve. Small Business: Further expand access to credit through targeted adjustments to how the firm evaluates credit applications, and it will introduce new product offerings. Financial Health: Continue to open more branches, including Community Center branches in low-to-moderate income communities, hire additional Community Managers and host more financial health workshops. Workforce: Continue to build a more equitable and representative workforce and hold executives accountable. Community Engagement: Host more local convenings with executives who play a direct role in the development of products, services, policy solutions and community investments.

NUEVA YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--JPMorgan Chase publicó una hoja informativa con detalles sobre su progreso en su compromiso de $30 mil millones de dólares hacia la equidad racial. El siguiente es el resumen ejecutivo. La hoja informativa completa está disponible en línea aquí. Resumen ejecutivo En octubre de 2020, JPMorgan Chase anunció una inversión de $30,000 millones en su Compromiso de Equidad Racial para ayudar a eliminar la brecha de riqueza racial entre las comunidades afroamericana, hispana y latina. La empresa está combinando sus conocimientos empresariales, filantrópicos, políticos y de datos para promover la equidad racial e impulsar el crecimiento inclusivo. El Compromiso de cinco años incluye préstamos, capital y financiación directa para ayudar a aumentar las viviendas en propiedad sostenibles, ampliar las viviendas asequibles, impulsar el crecimiento de las pequeñas empresas, apoyar a proveedores diversos, mejorar las condiciones financieras y el acceso a la banca y crear una mano de obra más diversa e inclusiva. La firma creó la infraestructura y los cimientos para avanzar en su Compromiso de Equidad Racial. Aunque aún queda mucho por hacer, a continuación se presenta un resumen del progreso hasta la fecha. De cara al futuro, JPMorgan Chase tiene previsto publicar sus avances anualmente en su informe medioambiental, social y de gobierno (ESG) a partir de mayo de 2022. Resumen de los avances JPMorgan Chase ha distribuido o comprometido más de $13,000 millones de dólares de su objetivo de $30,000 millones para ayudar a cerrar la brecha de riqueza racial. Esto viene impulsado en gran medida por la refinanciación de las viviendas en propiedad y la preservación de la vivienda de alquiler asequible, que eran productos y procesos existentes en los que la empresa tomó medidas inmediatas para actuar más. Si bien queda mucho trabajo por hacer, a continuación ofrecemos una actualización del Compromiso. Refinanciación de hipotecas: Dado el contexto de tipos históricamente bajos, la empresa ayudó rápidamente a los propietarios de viviendas a ahorrar dinero en sus pagos hipotecarios mensuales mediante la refinanciación de 16,000 de los 20,000 préstamos crecientes objetivo, 4,000 millones de dólares hasta la fecha.1 Viviendas en propiedad: Se contrataron más de 130 Community Home Lending Advisors que asesoran a compradores, se amplió el programa de ayudas a la compra de vivienda a $5,000 dólares en 6,700 barrios minoritarios de todo el país y se mejoraron los productos hipotecarios para crear un mejor acceso al crédito mediante mejoras en los precios y la ampliación del crédito. Viviendas de alquiler asequibles: Se financiaron más de $6,000 millones de dólares en préstamos para ayudar a preservar más de 60,000 viviendas de alquiler asequibles a lo largo de Estados Unidos. También se aprobaron préstamos por valor de $1,000 millones de dólares para la nueva construcción y rehabilitación de viviendas asequibles para hogares con ingresos bajos y moderados. Crecimiento de la pequeña empresa: Se contrataron más de 20 consultores empresariales de alto nivel para que ofrecieran asesoramiento individualizado y gratuito a propietarios de empresas en 13 ciudades de Estados Unidos y, hasta ahora, han asesorado a más de 900 propietarios de pequeñas empresas. Condiciones financieras: Se ayudó a los clientes a abrir más de 200,000 cuentas corrientes de bajo costo sin comisiones por sobregiro. La firma también abrió nueve sucursales de centros comunitarios y contratóde 72 gerentes comunitarios o Community Managers en comunidades desatendidas para establecer y fomentar las relaciones con líderes comunitarios, socios sin fines de lucro y pequeños negocios. Instituciones depositarias minoritarias (MDI) e instituciones financieras de desarrollo comunitario (CDFI): Se invirtieron más de $100 millones de dólares de capital en 14 MDI y CDFI de propiedad o dirección diversa que prestan servicio a más de 87 comunidades en 18 estados y el Distrito de Columbia. Fuerza laboral: Se incrementaron las asociaciones con las universidades históricamente destinadas a personas negras de 3 a 17 para profundizar en las asociaciones de contratación de la empresa, ampliar el desarrollo de los planes de estudio, las becas y los programas de tutoría. La empresa se comprometió a contratar a 4,000 estudiantes afroamericanos para 2024. Hasta la fecha, la firma ha contratado a más de 3,800 estudiantes negros como becarios y analistas de nivel inicial, y está en camino de superar el objetivo original. Filantropía: Se comprometieron $128 millones de dólares de su objetivo filantrópico de $2,000 millones, que incluye subvenciones, préstamos económicos y capital directo. La empresa está en camino de alcanzar su objetivo anual de más de 400 millones de dólares a finales de año. Actividades adicionales: El Compromiso de Equidad Racial se ha convertido en un catalizador para la evolución de la forma de hacer negocios de la empresa y ha inspirado otras actividades e inversiones que van más allá de los $30,000 millones de dólares. Algunos ejemplos son la creación de una clase de acciones del mercado monetario Empower, la coinversión de $200 millones de dólares en el Project Black, la elevación de las normas de diversidad, equidad e inclusión (DEI) como parte de su evaluación de la cadena de suministro y la inversión en la iniciativa Appraiser Diversity. Visite jpmorganchase.com/racialequity para obtener más información. Presentación de informes y gobernanza: Se ha establecido un sólido proceso de información y gobernanza para realizar un seguimiento coherente del Compromiso de $30,000 millones de dólares, gestionado por la organización Community Impact. El Comité de Responsabilidad Pública del Consejo de Administración de JPMorgan Chase supervisa esta labor y recibe información cada dos meses sobre los progresos de la empresa. Próximos pasos Sobre la base de la contratación de gerentes comunitatios, asesores de préstamos comunitarios para viviendas Community Home Lending Advisors y consultores de pequeños negocios, la creación y mejora de productos, la expansión de nuevas sucursales en más comunidades y otros esfuerzos, la empresa tiene previsto dar los siguientes pasos. Viviendas en propiedad: Seguir ampliando con prudencia los préstamos de la Administración Federal de Vivienda (FHA) y apoyar las reformas políticas del programa de la FHA, incluídas las normas de servicio. Viviendas de alquiler a precios accesibles: Explorar soluciones de financiación innovadoras y trabajar con nuevos recursos públicos para apoyar el desarrollo de instalaciones comunitarias vitales y nuevas viviendas para personas y familias con niveles de ingresos más amplios que los de los proyectos convencionales. Pequeñas empresas: Se seguirá ampliando el acceso al crédito mediante ajustes específicos en la forma en que la empresa evalúa las solicitudes de crédito, y se introducirán nuevas ofertas de productos. Condiciones financieras: Seguir abriendo más sucursales, incluidas las del Centro Comunitario en comunidades de ingresos bajos a moderados, contratar más gerentes comunitarios y organizar más talleres de orientación financiera. Mano de obra: Seguir construyendo una plantilla más equitativa y representativa y responsabilizar a los directivos. Compromiso con la comunidad: Organizar más reuniones locales con ejecutivos que desempeñen un papel directo en el desarrollo de productos, servicios, soluciones políticas e inversiones en la comunidad. Compromiso multicultural: Explorar las oportunidades de ampliar el acceso a los recursos, servicios y apoyo en el idioma según las últimas directrices de los reguladores del sector.

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Small and midsize U.S. business leaders remain confident in their companies and resourceful in their approaches to confronting macroeconomic challenges that have created growing pains over the last year, finds JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Business Leaders Outlook Survey released today. As a new year begins, the majority of business leaders are feeling upbeat: 83% of midsize and 71% of small businesses are optimistic about their own performance in 2022, up from 77% and 63% one year ago, respectively. Business leaders also have increased optimism around their industry performance and local, national and global economic outlooks compared to the start of 2021. Despite continued uncertainty posed by COVID-19, businesses are setting their expectations high, with 81% of midsize businesses and 63% of small businesses anticipating revenue and sales growth in the year ahead. In line with these expansion plans, more than 4 in 10 of those surveyed expect credit needs to increase in 2022, representing the highest percentages recorded in the last five years. “Businesses have been key accelerators of the continued economic recovery through their resolve and ingenuity in finding new ways to deliver products and services to their customers,” said Jim Glassman, head economist, JPMorgan Chase Commercial Banking. “They now have a stronger sense of how to remain competitive in the current economic landscape, which should allow them to build on last year’s momentum.” More than half (53%) of midsize businesses are operating at least at the same capacity as they were before the COVID-19 pandemic, with nearly one-third (31%) now running at a greater capacity than their pre-pandemic levels, indicating that some businesses have leaned into the disruption and continued to grow. Seventy percent have also seen profits return to or exceed pre-pandemic levels. The return to pre-pandemic productivity is on track to continue as 9 out of 10 midsize businesses expect to grow in 2022, with the most common growth drivers including expansion into new markets or geographies, innovation or diversification in product and services and increased consumer demand. Navigating Economic & Operational Challenges The achievements of the last year have not come easy, as businesses of all sizes have had to navigate an uncertain and obstacle-ridden operating environment. Below are the top three challenges cited by small and midsize business leaders. Business Leaders’ Top Challenges Small Businesses Midsize Businesses Economic uncertainty Labor shortage Inflation Ongoing supply chain issues Shifting consumer habits due to COVID-19 Higher cost of doing business In response to today’s challenges, small and midsize businesses have made changes to their business models, including: Supply Chain Workarounds: To alleviate supply chain disruptions, nearly two-thirds (65%) of midsize businesses have used strategic stockpiling and over half (51%) have added suppliers from new geographies. A significant number have also allocated more funds to cover increased costs related to moving products (48%), changed materials or manufacturing processes (32%) and replaced or stopped doing business with certain suppliers (30%). Employee Incentives: In response to recruiting and hiring concerns, a staggering 81% of midsize businesses and 38% of small businesses have or plan to increase wages. Flexibility is also a key consideration for many business leaders, with 45% of midsize businesses having or planning to give employees flexibility on where they work and 40% of small businesses already offering or planning to offer employees more flexible hours. To retain staff, small businesses have boosted their employee benefits, such as health insurance (61%) and 401K programs (37%). New Consumer Channels: While small businesses are concerned about how shifting consumer preferences due to COVID-19 will impact them, they are increasingly taking action to reach consumers via digital channels. Nearly one-quarter (24%) of small businesses have implemented more contactless payment options and 22% have increased selling on social media platforms. In the year ahead, 19% expect to move to a nearly 100% e-commerce model up from 12% one year ago. “Businesses today are eager to grow, but are having to navigate the reality of not being able to fill open roles quickly enough and dealing with disruptions in their supply chain that are slowing them down,” said John Simmons, head of Middle Market Banking & Specialized Industries, JPMorgan Chase Commercial Banking. “At the same time, it’s encouraging to see companies’ adaptability and the pivots they’ve made to push through major pain points. I’m inspired everyday by the grit and ingenuity of America’s business leaders, who have continued to shine throughout the pressures of the past 18-plus months.” The Financial Needs of Small Businesses In the year ahead, small business leaders are increasingly seeking new ways of financing and funding. Nearly 7 in 10 (69%) report planning or needing financing in 2022, up from 59% a year ago, with software systems and development being the greatest need (23%). To help fund their purchases, nearly half of small businesses plan to use business credit cards (48%), up from 38% a year ago, with line of credit funding being the next most common funding method. A growing number of small businesses (68%) also plan to explore online lending options, up from 56% a year ago. “We’re pleased to see that small business owners’ confidence level is improving,” said Ben Walter, CEO, Chase Business Banking. “Challenges remain, but our clients are resilient and we are proud to support them as they navigate supply shortages, adapt to shifting local safety requirements, and find creative ways to hire employees in a tight labor market. As confidence improves, we see a greater need for credit, and Chase stands ready to help.” New Year, New Considerations Businesses should consider the following as they plan for 2022: For more information on the Business Leaders Outlook, please view the midsize and small business reports. Survey Methodology JPMorgan Chase’s Business Leaders Outlook survey was conducted online from November 11-29, 2021, for small businesses (annual revenues between $100,000 and $20 million) and from November 2-22, 2021, for middle market companies (annual revenues between $20 million and $500 million). In total, more than 2,600 business leaders in various industries across the U.S. participated in the survey. For year-over-year trends, current data is compared to data collected in the first quarter of previous years. The results of this online survey are within statistical parameters for validity, and the error rate is plus or minus 3.1% for the small business findings and plus or minus 2.5% for the midsize business findings, both at the 95% confidence level.

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--JPMorgan Chase today announced two of six winners to receive $5 million each in philanthropic capital as part of an annual competition to source innovative and sustainable ideas to advance equity in communities across the U.S. This year, the firm sourced proposals for projects designed for and by Black and Latina women to address racial and gender wealth gaps. Starting with Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, MD, JPMorgan Chase will award winning collaborations across six U.S. cities a total of $30 million in philanthropic commitments. When COVID-19 disrupted America’s economy, it exacerbated deep economic disparities faced by Black and Latina women.1 Over two million women left the labor force during the COVID crisis, and the unemployment rate for Black and Latina women remains persistently higher than the unemployment rates for White and Asian men and women.2 According to the JPMorgan Chase Institute, Black and Latina women were particularly vulnerable to the financial effects of the pandemic and saw differential impacts such as childcare responsibilities created by closed or virtual schools and day cares. For example, Black and Latina female-led households experienced the fastest depletion of their stimulus balance gains. “To help address the challenges faced by many Black and Latina women across the U.S., we are investing in collaborations, drawing on the strengths of public and private sectors, to develop and test innovative and sustainable solutions. We know taking on these monumental issues will require a diversity of perspectives, areas of expertise, and skills,” said Demetrios Marantis, Global Head of Corporate Responsibility, JPMorgan Chase & Co. “Nearly two years into the pandemic in the U.S., we have continued to lose ground on the longstanding economic disparities that have disproportionately impacted Black, Hispanic and Latino people, especially women.” These proposals will help drive solutions to support Black and Latina women who have been disproportionately impacted by the effects of COVID-19. Winning collaborations demonstrated significant experience improving outcomes for Black and Latina women, and offered timely and promising approaches to financial health and coaching, entrepreneurship, housing stability and career support. Winning proposals were selected both on the strength of their ideas and their potential to reach scale through policy and practice change. JPMorgan Chase will also work with national partners to support evaluation and facilitate a learning community among the six winners to enhance the long-term sustainability of their solutions, meet the changing needs of each community, and share learnings. Today’s announcement is part of JPMorgan Chase’s $30 billion racial equity commitment to drive economic inclusion and builds on the firm’s initiatives to invest in solutions to drive equitable growth and community-based strategies across the country. Five of the six collaborations are led by Black and Latina women. Today, the firm announced two of the winners: Advancing Early Education in Washington, D.C: In the Washington region, the majority of early childcare educators are Black and Latina women and only one-fifth of all early childhood educators in the Washington region have a bachelor’s degree. Educators with bachelor’s degrees have more access to promotions, and the overall average hourly wage for educators with a degree is higher than wages for educators without a degree.3 With JPMorgan Chase’s $5 million three-year commitment, Martha’s Table, LIFT-DC, Venture Philanthropy Partners+ Raise DC, American University, Trinity Washington University, and the Urban Institute are launching the Advancing Early Education Collaborative—a partnership to increase access to education, skills, and training opportunities, as well as wealth building and capacity building for early childhood educators and the centers that employ them. The Advancing Early Education Collaborative will: Expand access to postsecondary education through fully funded scholarships and certification opportunities; Provide services such as education and financial coaching, technology access, professional development, stipends for childcare and transportation, access to children’s clothing and professional attire, and access to healthy groceries for participants; Support early education providers by coordinating and centralizing costs such as information technology, billing services, human resources, professional development, healthcare and retirement benefits for staff. Prioritizing Black and Latina Women’s Economic Rise in Baltimore, MD: 66% of Black, Latino and Hispanic households in Baltimore meet the standard for liquid-asset poverty. The largest percentage of those experiencing poverty are women between 25 and 54, with 50% of this population also being cost-burdened renters.4 With JPMorgan Chase’s $5 million three-year commitment, Latino Economic Development Center of Washington, D.C., University of Maryland Baltimore’s Community Engagement Center, Black Women Build Baltimore, Baltimore D.C. Building Trades, Byte Back and Baltimore Community Lending will create a continuum of wealth building for Black and Latina women developers in West Baltimore. To do so, this collaborative will: Provide lines of credit and grants to Black and Latina women real estate developers in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods of Baltimore City to help eliminate barriers in real estate development and close the appraisal gap; Recruit Black and Latina women into construction apprenticeships by providing readiness training programs to prepare women to apply for, enter, and complete a building trades-registered apprenticeship; Establish a small business incubator program, including direct capital support and one-on-one coaching to meet women entrepreneur’s needs. Four additional winners will be announced in the coming weeks. Today’s announcement builds on JPMorgan Chase’s commitment to expanding opportunities for women around the world by supporting organizations like the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, Jeremiah Program, Capital Enterprise and SmartStart. This year’s investment in the six collaborations across the U.S. draws from lessons learned from previous competitions. Key factors that result in lasting change include: Shared priorities and a common understanding of goals; A powerful vision for the future shaped by deep community engagement; Strong leadership and collaboration among partners with resources to drive change; Data-driven and evidence-based approaches that accelerate progress advancing equity. About JPMorgan Chase’s $500 million commitment to drive growth In 2018, JPMorgan Chase created a $500 million five-year initiative that combines the firm’s lending capital, philanthropic capital and expertise to make investments in cities around the world. The program includes large scale commitments in cities where deeper investments are needed to drive inclusive growth, as well as a challenge to source innovative cross-sector solutions for U.S. cities. What started as the AdvancingCities Challenge launched in September 2018 has since attracted more than 600 proposals over three cycles; in 2021, we received more than 200 applications from nearly 80 communities across 34 states. Statements of Support Kim R. Ford, President & CEO of Martha’s Table: “Our work is driven by our belief that every Washingtonian deserves the opportunity to thrive. We are deeply grateful to the JPMorgan Chase and to our outstanding peers in the Advancing Early Education Collaborative for their partnership. Together, we will help foster a strong workforce of talented early educators as well as an educational system that reflects the true value of this critical profession.” Emi Reyes, Chief Executive Officer of Latino Economic Development Center: “For LEDC, our mission has always been to advance financial wealth in the Latino and underserved communities. LEDC also understands how Black and Latina women can impact our communities and serve as pillars if given the appropriate resources and tools. However, Black and Latina women are often left behind with heavy housing financial burdens or a lack of information and training. The pandemic has also disproportionately affected Black and Latina women and their financial equity. Thanks to JP Morgan Chase's three-year commitment, LEDC can continue to expand its mission in West Baltimore, decrease the wealth gap for Black and Latina women, and generate small business opportunities for all of these women and their ideas.""

WASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--On Tuesday, JPMorgan Chase announced a $75 million, five-year commitment in philanthropic capital and flexible low-cost loans to the Greater Washington region. These investments are drawn from critical lessons learned from the firm’s business growth and community investments in the Mid-Atlantic region over the past five years. Wards 7 & 8 in Washington D.C. and Baltimore, Maryland will each benefit from $20 million from the new commitment, while the remaining $35 million will be divided up across the region including to places such as Richmond, Virginia. This new commitment brings the firm’s total investments focused on Black, Hispanic, Latino and other underserved communities in the region to $125 million by 2025. Prior to the pandemic, almost one-fifth of the D.C. population was living in poverty. The racial wealth gap was eight times greater than the national average, with white households in D.C. having 81 times the wealth of Black households — and the pandemic has only widened the gap (Urban Institute). “Business must do its part to help solve challenges facing the customers and communities it serves,” said Peter Scher, Vice Chairman, JPMorgan Chase & Co “Addressing inequities requires concerted and sustained efforts by public and private sector partners that seek to build wealth for Communities of Color. This new commitment, along with what we’ve learned from growing our business and community support here, will hopefully be a model for others to follow and help create meaningful, lasting, and equitable change in the region.” Creating a More Equitable Greater Washington Region From the firm’s initial $10 million commitment, it has learned a number of lessons which will inform its business and philanthropic investments, collaboration with business and community partners and policy support going forward: 1) Regional collaboration is necessary to bridge the racial wealth divide 2) Invest in women of color, who are key drivers of household economic mobility 3) Change systems by removing embedded barriers through intentional and integrated investment, philanthropy and policy 4) Invest in diverse-led organizations and business that are “by and for” communities of color Some of the firm’s new philanthropic investments, which have been informed by these lessons, include support for an effort to connect women to wealth building opportunities, and a long-term affordable housing initiative that seeks to advance systems change. Connecting Women to Wealth-Building Opportunities in the Region As part of JPMorgan Chase’s annual competition to source innovative and sustainable ideas to advance equity in communities across the U.S., the firm sourced proposals for projects designed for and by Black and Latina women to address racial and gender wealth gaps. Two of the six winning collaborations are from Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, MD. Each collaboration has been awarded $5 million to advance and help source solutions for women who have been disproportionately impacted by the economic effects of COVID-19. Advancing Early Education Collaborative—In the Washington region, the majority of early childcare educators are Black and Latina women and only one-fifth of all early childhood educators in the Washington region have a bachelor’s degree. Educators with bachelor’s degrees have more access to promotions, and a higher average hourly wage (Urban Institute, 2018). With JPMorgan Chase’s $5 million three-year commitment, Martha’s Table, LIFT DC, Venture Philanthropy Partners, American University, and Trinity Washington University will launch the Advancing Early Education Collaborative—a partnership to increase access to education, skills, and training opportunities in the field of early education for Black and Latina women specifically in Wards 7 & 8 in D.C. POWER: Prioritizing Our Women’s Economic Rise Collaborative – 66% of Black and Latino Baltimore households meet the standard for liquid-asset poverty. The largest percentage of those experiencing poverty are women between 25 and 54, with 50% of this population also being cost-burdened renters. With JPMorgan Chase’s $5 million three-year commitment, Latino Economic Development Center of Washington D.C., University of Maryland Baltimore’s Community Engagement Center, Black Women Build Baltimore, Baltimore- D.C. Building Trades, Byte Back and Baltimore Community Lending will create a continuum of wealth building programs for Black and Latina women real estate developers in West Baltimore. Closing the Housing Affordability Gap By combining business, data, policy and philanthropic resources, the firm aims to improve housing affordability and stability as well as homeownership opportunities for Black, Latino and Hispanic households in the Greater-Washington area. JPMorgan Chase is supporting organizations that will create sustainable solutions. Parity Homes– Redlining, urban renewal, and eminent domain have decimated once thriving Black communities, limiting opportunities for Black households to generate wealth. With JPMorgan Chase’s $2 million three-year commitment, Parity Homes will scale its approach to sparking upfront demand for homeownership opportunities in neighborhoods experiencing hyper vacancy by creating pathways for existing residents and other social collectives to purchase homes together block-by-block as a means of community-building and wealth-building. Equal Justice Works – With JPMorgan Chase’s $1.5 million three-year commitment, Equal Justice Works will bring together a group of lawyers and community organizers (‘Fellows’) as part of its Housing Justice Program to increase access to high-quality legal services and tenant resources for low-income Black, Latino and Hispanic households and residents of public housing. Housing Justice Program Fellows will also engage in high impact litigation to support practices that protect the rights of tenants across Virginia. Coalition for Nonprofit Housing and Economic Development – With JPMorgan Chase’s $1.95 million three-year commitment, the Coalition for Nonprofit Housing and Economic Development will lead a multi-sector effort to help Black, Hispanic and Latino residents build wealth by increasing the supply of safe, affordable housing and building pathways for local ownership. This investment is part of the firm’s collaboration with the Center for Community Investment to support six cities to advance more equitable housing results. These commitments continue to be informed by recent progress and insights from the firm’s philanthropic work in the region since 2017, and through conversations with local community, government and business leaders in Washington D.C., Baltimore and Richmond. “We are focused, in Washington, D.C., on how we give more residents a fair shot and make our city’s prosperity more inclusive. Part of that work means bringing together public, private, and philanthropic partners to make strategic investments in the people and communities that need them most. And that’s what we’re doing here,” said Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser. “This investment from JPMorgan Chase, an investment in Black and Latina women, in early education, and in affordable housing, will give more families in D.C. the fair shot they deserve.” Tuesday’s announcement is part of JPMorgan Chase’s $30 billion racial equity commitment to advance economic inclusion and help close the racial wealth gap. JPMorgan Chase has been doing business in Greater Washington since 1999 and serves more than 2.3 million consumers and 94,000 business clients in the region. By the end of 2022, Chase is expected to open more than 70 branches from Baltimore to Richmond with 28% of branches in low to moderate income communities. About JPMorgan Chase JPMorgan Chase & Co.

科羅拉多州博爾德--(BUSINESS WIRE)--(美國商業資訊)--Techstars今天公佈由摩根大通支持的新加速器計畫。該計畫將在全美對多元化企業家和創辦人進行投資，金額超過8,000萬美元。Techstars和摩根大通於2021年開始合作規劃這項計畫，重點是在主要經濟中心推進公平獲得資金的機會。 2021年上半年，黑人企業家僅獲得1.2%的美國創投資金。其他數據顯示，拉丁裔創辦人在2021年僅籌集了2%的美國創投投資。此次合作旨在透過Techstars獨特的創業加速器，為早期階段創業者提供融資管道、一對一的指導和客製化方案，幫助縮小種族和族裔的財富鴻溝。 Techstars執行長Mäelle Gavet表示：「數據和經驗顯示，來自不同社區和背景的創辦人代表尚未開發的市場，對於投資者、企業家及其營運所在的社區而言，這個市場有著巨大的財務上升空間。我們的目標是在摩根大通的幫助下，使我們的計畫在吸引、支持和投資黑人、拉丁裔和其他代表性不足的創辦人方面更有意圖性。」 摩根大通私人銀行(J.P. Morgan Private Bank)另類投資業務全球負責人Kristin Kallergis Rowland表示：「我們與Techstars的共同目標是改善代表性不足的企業家獲得創業、融資和擴大業務規模所需的資金和其他資源的管道。」 Techstars的現有投資組合公司執行長中有27%是黑人、西班牙裔和拉丁裔、美洲原住民、美洲印第安人或阿拉斯加原住民、夏威夷原住民或其他太平洋島民，以及中東或北非人。本次合作旨在為處於早期階段的高成長初創企業的多元化創辦人提供進一步的支援，以創造更高的收入、更大的影響力和更多的財富。 摩根大通私人銀行多元化經理人策略負責人Tiffany Lewis表示：「這項多年期計畫將重點關注那些被傳統創投資金來源忽視的企業家和創辦人。這項新措施將透過獲得金融服務、指導、優質教育和培訓，以及促進包容性商業實務，推動社會向更公平的經濟機會轉變。」 在未來三年內，這筆投資將透過在美國九座城市實施的37個Techstars計畫分配給400多家公司。首批五個城市為亞特蘭大、芝加哥、底特律、邁阿密和華盛頓特區，這些城市今天邀請各種背景的企業家提出申請。洛杉磯、紐奧爾良、紐約和奧克蘭的計畫將於2023年啟動。這九個高成長科技生態系統脫穎而出是出於若干策略性原因，其中包括每項計畫都力求反映的人口構成的多樣性。 每個為期三個月的專案都將支持像Jasmine Jones這樣的創辦人，她在2020年參與了Techstars的坎薩斯市加速器計畫。 Techstars投資組合公司Cherry Blossom Intimates的共同創辦人Jasmine描述她的Techstars經歷是打開了邁向成功的無限可能之門。她表示：「我遇到了90多位導師，他們協助我改良商業模式，建立自己的股權結構表，並在30天內籌集了125萬美元。」 「讓我感到興奮的是，Techstars計畫開啟了新的可能性和商業潛力之門。這個網路是非常寶貴的。」 Cherry Blossom Intimates是經過認證的線上醫療機構和實體精品店。在參與Techstars計畫期間，Jasmine還推出了Myya，這是第一個直接面對消費者的乳房切除術後品牌。該品牌還接受保險，並使病患能與認證介助員聯絡，以便在家裡安裝乳房切除術後胸罩和義乳。 在這項在美國多個城市進行的計畫中衡量影響並確保問責至關重要，因為這些微小的進展可以幫助縮小種族財富差距和日益加劇的經濟不平等。雖然這些計畫對所有背景的創辦人開放，但招募工作將著重於黑人、拉丁裔和西班牙裔企業家，以及那些認同種族和民族多元化的人。計畫進行期間將定期追蹤並與兩個組織的高階領導層分享進展情況。這些努力將進一步擴大計畫的影響力，並為更廣泛的投資界帶來更大的公平性和包容性。 關於Techstars Techstars全球網路協助企業家獲得成功。Techstars創立於2006年，它的成立源於三個簡單的想法——企業家能夠為大家創造更美好的未來；合作推動創新；以及偉大的構想可以來自於任何地方。現在，我們的使命是讓地球上的每個人都能對企業家的成功有所貢獻，並從中受益。除了運行加速器計畫和創投基金之外，我們還聯合初創企業、投資者、大公司和城市的力量，幫助創建欣欣向榮的初創企業社群。Techstars已投資超過2,900家公司，這些公司的合併市值約為1,590億美元。www.techstars.com 關於摩根大通 摩根大通公司(JPMorgan Chase & Co., NYSE: JPM)是全球首屈一指的金融服務公司，擁有3.2兆美元資產，業務營運遍及全球。該公司是投資銀行、消費者和小企業金融服務、商業銀行、金融交易處理和資產管理領域的領導者。摩根大通公司為道瓊工業平均指數的組成部分，以J.P.摩根和大通品牌在美國為數百萬客戶和許多全世界最優秀的企業、機構和政府客戶提供服務。 免責聲明：本公告之原文版本乃官方授權版本。譯文僅供方便瞭解之用，煩請參照原文，原文版本乃唯一具法律效力之版本。"

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Chase today announced that it will pilot public fast electric vehicle charging stations across 50 of its U.S. branches beginning this summer. This adds to the firm’s efforts to promote environmental sustainability in its retail locations as it also aims to expand on-site solar power to approximately 400 additional branches by the end of 2022. To bring the charging stations to branches, the bank partnered with EVgo, a pioneer and innovator in transportation electrification. The company builds, owns and operates the nation’s largest network of public DC fast chargers, powered by 100% renewable energy. Charging stations at branches bring added convenience to customers, allowing them to set up a meeting with a banker and conduct their banking needs while charging their cars. “We’re always listening and taking feedback from customers when it comes to the branch experience, and we know environmental sustainability is important to them,” said Jennifer Roberts, CEO of Chase Consumer Banking. “We’re excited to work together with EVgo to bring electric vehicle charging to our branches and offer this important service to thousands of customers and their communities.” Fast chargers will be installed at select Chase branch locations in states like California, Indiana, Illinois, New York, Oregon, and Pennsylvania, offering thousands of drivers access to 100kW and 350kW chargers that can charge vehicles as much as 80% in 15-45 minutes.* The bank expects to have all stations available for use by the summer of 2023. Once installed and operational at the 50 branch locations, EVgo estimates chargers will deliver up to 9.4million kWh annually to provide nearly 30 million EV miles charged, equivalent to avoiding 12,000 mt of CO2 and planting approximately 196,000 trees each year. “Reducing the amount of pollution from tailpipes will have real benefits for consumers and communities, and increasing the availability of convenient public fast charging gives more drivers peace of mind to switch to electric,” said Cathy Zoi, CEO of EVgo. “Having access to fast charging in everyday settings of life – the local bank being a great example as well as an important community staple – is truly key. We’re excited to partner with Chase, and together with our shared values, we look forward to working together on decarbonizing transportation and improving our communities.” Transportation is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. While electric vehicles promise to be the future of transportation – projected to reach 145 million on the road by 2030 – the lack of charging infrastructure is one of the biggest hurdles to EV adoption. This collaboration will help scale the EV industry in communities across the U.S. The installation of EVgo charging stations, powered by 100% renewable energy, builds on JPMorgan Chase’s efforts to promote environmental sustainability and the adoption of renewables, including in its thousands of retail branches across the U.S. In the coming months, Chase will also continue to expand on-site solar power at its branches across the U.S. To date, Chase has added solar installations at over 350 branches in Michigan, Arizona Nevada, and California, with additional projects underway in Florida, Ohio, Colorado, Illinois, Louisiana, Indiana and New York. Chase’s goal is to complete solar installations at approximately 400 additional branches plus 125 carports – solar panels installed above parking lots – by the end of 2022. When the project is complete, it will provide over 25 megawatts of solar capacity, or enough to power approximately 3,200 homes. This effort is part of the firm’s strategy to minimize the environmental impact of its operations, and will contribute toward the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from its buildings, branches and data centers by 40% by 2030. ## * Actual charging speed depends on vehicle’s charging capability About Chase Chase is the U.S. consumer and commercial banking business of JPMorgan Chase & Co.

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--JPMorgan Chase today unveiled the design for its new state-of-the-art global headquarters at 270 Park Avenue, reinforcing its commitment to New York City. The 1,388-foot, 60-story skyscraper – designed by Foster + Partners – will be New York City’s largest all-electric tower with net zero operational emissions and exceptional indoor air quality that exceeds the highest standards in sustainability, health and wellness. It will help define the modern workplace with 21st century infrastructure, smart technology and 2.5 million square feet of flexible and collaborative space that can easily adapt to the future of work. The project is the first under New York City’s innovative Midtown East Rezoning plan, which encourages modern office construction and improvements to the business district’s public realm and transportation. With this new headquarters commitment, JPMorgan Chase will remain one of New York’s largest employers and continue to make a significant impact on the local economy – helping small businesses and supporting additional job growth as the region recovers from the global pandemic. The firm is also making a significant investment to help improve the city’s infrastructure and transit system and working closely with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The project is expected to be completed by the end of 2025. During the building period alone, the project will create more than 8,000 construction jobs from across 40 local unions – triggering additional economic activity of $2.6 billion for New York City and $3.6 billion for New York State overall. An independent study by Deloitte found that through JPMorgan Chase’s tens of thousands of local employees and operations, the firm contributes $29.8 billion in annual economic activity to New York City, stimulating an additional 40,000 jobs across several local industries. In New York State, the firm contributes a total of $39.8 billion annually to the state’s economy, stimulating an additional 61,000 jobs overall. The new building will house up to 14,000 employees – replacing an outdated facility designed in the late 1950s for about 3,500 employees. It will offer 2.5 times more outdoor space on the ground level of Park and Madison Avenues, featuring wider sidewalks and a large public plaza on Madison Avenue with natural green space and other amenities geared toward the residents, workers and visitors who frequent the neighborhood on a daily basis. The concept for the new design was to create a timeless addition to Park Avenue, which celebrates the city’s iconic architectural history and serves as a powerful new symbol for the next generation of office towers in New York. Using a state-of-the-art structural system to negotiate the site constraints below and at ground level, the innovative fan-column structure and triangular bracing allow the building to touch the ground lightly across the entire block. By lifting the building about 80 feet off the ground, it extends the viewpoint from the Park Avenue entrance through to Madison Avenue. Sustainable design 270 Park will be New York City’s largest all-electric skyscraper with net zero operational emissions and will be 100% powered by renewable energy sourced from a New York State hydroelectric plant. In addition to operating on net zero carbon emissions, the building will use state-of-the-art building technology and systems to ensure it operates as efficiently as possible, including: Intelligent building technology that uses sensors, AI and machine learning systems to predict, respond and adapt to energy needs. Advanced water storage and reuse systems to reduce water usage by more than 40%. Triple pane glazing on the façade and automatic solar shades connected to HVAC systems for greater energy efficiency. Outdoor terraces featuring natural green space and plantings. The firm also recycled, reused or upcycled 97% of the building materials from the demolition – far exceeding the 75% requirement of the leading green building standard. Defining the modern workplace with a flexible design focused on health, wellness and hospitality JPMorgan Chase is partnering with experts, including Director of Harvard University’s Healthy Buildings program Dr. Joseph Allen, wellness expert Dr. Deepak Chopra, and Union Square Hospitality Group’s Danny Meyer to create a world-class wellness and hospitality experience for employees, clients and visitors by: Doubling the amount of outside, fresh air and continuously monitoring air quality to improve the overall health and well-being of employees. Using advanced HVAC filtration systems to continually clean outdoor air as it comes into the building, while simultaneously cleaning recirculated air. Designing 50% more communal spaces and 25% more volume of space per person – giving more choices in where and how to work. Flexible column-free floor plates will allow space to easily change layout and floor design, including inter-floor connections. Offering a state-of-the-art health and wellness center that will feature fitness areas, yoga/cycling rooms, physical therapy, medical services, modern mother’s rooms and prayer and meditation spaces. Designing a large and modern food hall featuring diverse food operators and healthy menus as well as a world-class conference center at the top of the 60-story tower offering unobstructed city views and dynamic events for clients and employees. Creating a touchless journey for employees and visitors with more than 50,000 connected devices that will make it the most connected, data-driven high-rise building in New York City. Bringing nature indoors through biophilic design, including wide use of natural plants and healthier furniture and building materials. Bringing in 30% more daylight than a typical developer-led, speculative office building and using circadian lighting to minimize the effects of electric light and support a healthier indoor environment. Official statements Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of JPMorgan Chase: “With our new headquarters, JPMorgan Chase is making a long-term investment in our business and New York City’s future while ensuring that we operate in a highly efficient and world-class environment for the 21st century. We are extremely excited about the building’s state-of-the-art technology, health and wellness amenities, and public spaces, among many other features. It is in the best location in one of the world’s greatest cities.” New York State Governor Kathy Hochul: “New York is unmatched in our visionary innovation, educated workforce and business-friendly climate, and I commend JPMorgan Chase for expanding their investment in Midtown and recommitting their future to our great state. JPMorgan Chase’s new state-of-the-art global headquarters will not only support thousands of working professionals to New York City, but also will create thousands of good paying, union construction jobs and further spur our state’s economic comeback. As we recover from the pandemic, we will continue to make transformative investments in our infrastructure and workforce so that when it comes to starting or growing your business, there’s no better place than in New York.” New York City Mayor Eric Adams: “New York City’s central business districts were hit hard by the pandemic, and restoring their vibrance is an integral part of our blueprint for an equitable economic recovery. This investment by JPMorgan Chase not only reflects their commitment to keeping and growing good jobs in New York City, it will also catalyze additional investment and new office space throughout Midtown East. And by incorporating sustainable design into the building, they are helping our city prepare for and mitigate the impacts of climate change.” Norman Foster, Founder and Executive Chairman of Foster + Partners: “270 Park Avenue is set to be a new landmark that responds to its historic location as well as the legacy of JPMorgan Chase in New York. The unique design rises to the challenge of respecting the rhythm and distinctive streetscape of Park Avenue, while accommodating the vital transport infrastructure of the city below. The result is an elegant solution where the architecture is the structure, and the structure is the architecture, embracing a new vision that will serve JPMorgan Chase now and well into the future.” Joseph Allen, Associate Professor and Director of the Healthy Buildings program at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and CEO of 9 Foundations: “Designed with a health-first mindset in all aspects, this project proves you can have both excellent indoor air quality for occupants, while also addressing sustainability goals that improve the health of the community by reducing impacts on the planet. This building sets new standards of excellence for healthy building in New York City and around the world.” Gary LaBarbera, President of the Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York: “With the global pandemic impacting our city and our world so dramatically during the last two difficult and painful years, I have never been so proud of the skilled workers of the NYC Building Trades Council who have come to work every day to make sure that major projects like 270 Park Avenue continue to get built and drive economic growth for our region. The men and women who have worked on the demolition and the construction at JPMorgan Chase’s site, and in the below grade East Side Access transportation hub, have demonstrated a level of commitment and determination that is commendable and inspiring, especially during the unprecedented COVID pandemic that continues to impact our country and nations around the world.” New York City Council Member Keith Powers: “270 Park Avenue is a historic project – the first major development under the East Midtown rezoning plan. The JPMorgan Chase headquarters brings many good, well-paying jobs to the community, strong economic growth for the city, and important public improvements such as transportation upgrades and more. I thank all the relevant stakeholders involved in this effort and look forward to enjoying the new and improved amenities and public space on the East Side.” MTA Chair and CEO Janno Lieber: “It was challenging to thread the foundation of the new headquarters through historic Grand Central Station and the new LIRR Terminal below it, but we couldn’t have a better partner than JPMorgan Chase. Putting top-tier companies and thousands of jobs next to the best mass transit is key to New York’s future, and this project has been a model public-private partnership.” Rob Speyer, Chief Executive Officer of Tishman Speyer: “Tishman Speyer is proud to act as the development partner for JPMorgan Chase’s future headquarters. This project will benefit JPMorgan Chase’s workforce, area commuters, visitors and city residents more broadly for decades. 270 Park Avenue will stand as a global model for the next generation of office buildings, serving as an engine for economic growth, fostering a healthy work environment, and prioritizing sustainability.” Troy Rudd, Chief Executive Officer of AECOM: “With a proud history shaping New York City’s future, we applaud JPMorgan Chase’s commitment to New York City at this important moment and we are excited to be part of the team transforming Midtown. This project will continue to fuel New York’s recovery, creating thousands of jobs and generating millions in economic activity, and help the city reach its key sustainability goals.” Vishaan Chakrabarti, Collaborating Architect and Founder, Practice for Architecture and Urbanism: “The new 270 Park will earn its place among Manhattan’s revered Jazz Age skyscrapers. It is a gift to our skyline and our streets, with a monumental axis connecting Park and Madison Avenues, gracious and enduring materials, generous public spaces and sidewalks, and robust connections to Grand Central Station. JPMorgan Chase’s new headquarters is a great example of New York’s resilience and rebirth.” Official images and video Please visit the following link to download the official images and video. https://fosterandpartners.app.box.com/s/l14vsm6abu9v3itt7eepu9h9s9zjgs0y About JPMorgan Chase & Co.

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, StartOut and J.P. Morgan announced the ten companies selected to participate in the StartOut Growth Lab accelerator program.

Morgan is proud to expand its support for StartOut in its mission to accelerate that growth,” said David Barbee, who leads JPMorgan Chase Commercial Banking’s LGBTQ+ initiatives. “We are excited to welcome Cohort 10 to the Growth Lab and know that their growth will catalyze solutions to some of the most pressing issues of the day, from the green economy to enhanced healthcare services and beyond.” The companies selected to join Cohort 10 are: Carbon Reform (Newark, DE): A manufacturer of modular carbon capture devices for commercial building ventilation systems that improve indoor air quality for occupants, create energy savings for building owners, and directly capture and permanently sequesters tons of CO2 annually CreatorUp Inc.

We can’t wait to help accelerate the growth of this next group of passionate entrepreneurs!” Continued Partnership J.P. Morgan’s co-sponsorship of the Growth Lab is an expansion of the firm’s ongoing relationship with StartOut and a part of its broader commitment to supporting LGBTQ+ entrepreneurs. In 2019, JPMorgan Chase sponsored StartOut’s Pride Economic Inclusion Index (SPEII), as part of the firm’s $150 million Small Business Forward initiative to invest in underserved entrepreneurs. In 2021, the firm’s Office of LGBT+ Affairs, which advances equity and inclusion for LGBTQ+ employees, customers, business partners and communities, announced an additional $500,000 commitment to expand the SPEII, which now provides near real-time, data-driven insights into the US entrepreneurial ecosystem.

WASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Morgan Health, the JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) business unit focused on improving the quality, equity and affordability of employer-sponsored health care, announced a $30 million investment in Centivo, an innovative provider of health plans for self-insured employers built to address health care affordability for employees and their families. Centivo’s model is anchored around relationships with leading accountable care providers with a proven track record of delivering high-quality, cost-effective care. Centivo works to align incentives between these providers and self-funded employers through timely access to care, affordable and predictable costs and outcomes-based compensation for providers tied to quality and cost-effectiveness. Through this approach, employers can typically offer health benefit plan options that include free adult and pediatric primary care for all visits, no deductibles, predictable copays for all non-primary care, enhanced patient access and integrated virtual primary care. Among mid-size and large employers, Centivo’s typical client has saved 15 to 30 percent annually compared to traditional insurance models. In addition, members’ medical and pharmacy out-of-pocket cost has, on average, been reduced to less than $350 per person per year. These cost reductions have occurred all while increasing primary care utilization by more than 30 percent and strengthening quality through an advanced primary care-centered clinical model. Centivo members report high levels of satisfaction with overall affordability, cost predictability and care coordination. Morgan Health’s investment is part of an extended Series B-1 financing. This extension will support Centivo’s rapid growth and expansion amid increased demand from employers and employees. “There is a critical and growing need for employers to offer – and for employees to have access to – high quality and affordable health insurance options. Sky-high premiums, deductibles and out-of-pocket costs make coverage unaffordable for too many. Centivo’s model offers a technology-driven and innovative primary care platform that can respond to members’ health needs at every moment,” said Peter Scher, Vice Chairman of JPMorgan Chase, a member of the firm’s Operating Committee who oversees Morgan Health. Scher will join Centivo’s Board. “Centivo recognizes the importance of being an advocate and partner in members’ health care journey. Our strategic investment and long-term support will help accelerate Centivo’s efforts so more Americans with employer-sponsored insurance can benefit from affordable, high-quality primary and accountable care,” said Dan Mendelson, CEO of Morgan Health. Launched in 2019, Centivo has continued to expand its reach among self-insured employers and now has a market presence in 13 states. The company’s growing roster of clients include employers with as few as 51 employees as well as numerous Fortune 500 companies. “We are honored and proud to be among the initial group of Morgan Health’s strategic investments,” said Ashok Subramanian, CEO of Centivo. “Morgan Health and Centivo share a joint mission of restoring health care affordability and value for American workers through a greater emphasis on accountable care. This investment will further increase our ability to do so for more and more employers and their employees while continuing to enhance the simplicity and affordability of Centivo’s health plan for members and patients.” Morgan Health’s investment in Centivo follows its recent investments in Vera Whole Health, and subsequent investment in Castlight, Embold Health and a research collaboration with Kaiser Permanente. Morgan Health will continue to identify emerging and developing accountable care models with the goal of helping to scale and expand these offerings for JPMC’s employees and the more than 150 million Americans with employer-sponsored health insurance. About Morgan Health Morgan Health is a JPMorgan Chase business unit focused on improving employer-sponsored health care. Through its investments and the advancement of accountable care, Morgan Health is working to improve the quality, equity and affordability of employer-sponsored health care for JPMorgan Chase employees, their families and the U.S. health system. The business is led by Dan Mendelson, CEO of Morgan Health, reporting to Peter Scher, Vice Chairman of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and a member of the firm’s Operating Committee. Morgan Health is headquartered in Washington, D.C. Visit morganhealth.com. About Centivo Centivo is an innovative health plan for self-funded employers on a mission to bring affordable, high-quality healthcare to the millions of working Americans who struggle to pay their medical bills. Anchored around a primary care based ACO model, Centivo saves employers 15 to 30 percent compared to traditional insurance carriers. Employees also realize significant savings through our free primary care (including virtual), predictable copay and no-deductible benefit plan design. Centivo works with employers ranging in size from 51 employees to Fortune 500 companies. For more information, visit centivo.com."

WASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Many Americans who depend on employer-sponsored health care are managing complex, costly health conditions and face significant gaps in diagnosis and disease management across race, ethnicity and income levels, according to a new analysis from Morgan Health and NORC at the University of Chicago. Further, for employed individuals with low- and moderate-incomes, the high cost of care and insurance, including deductibles and out-of-pocket costs, forced many to forgo or delay necessary medical treatments. More than 150 million Americans depend on employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) for their health care. While the national focus on health inequities has centered on the U.S. population at large, the health status of ESI enrollees has not been well understood given historical data gaps and limitations in analyzing health outcomes across race, ethnicity and income. “These findings are a wake-up call for business leaders on the severe health disparities that exist across the country’s workforce,” said Dan Mendelson, Morgan Health CEO. “The business community has a responsibility to understand and recognize these disparities, and more importantly, act to eliminate them. This will require active engagement with health plans and providers to close gaps and improve health outcomes.” The Morgan Health-NORC analysis reflects the latest data on ESI enrollees from three nationally-representative, public surveys and national vital statistics records. The findings present an important snapshot of health outcomes and disparities prior to the onset of COVID-19. Some of the most significant disparities appear to be associated with income differences, while others vary by race and sexual orientation, even when controlling for other factors. Key Findings: The burden of chronic disease varies significantly across races with data revealing underdiagnosis of key conditions for certain patient populations. Blood pressure: 60.4 percent of Black enrollees, 40.7 percent of Asian enrollees and 44.2 percent of Hispanic enrollees had high blood pressure, compared to 46.0 percent of white enrollees. After adjusting for age and sex, Black enrollees were 16.7 percentage points more likely to have high blood pressure than white enrollees. Furthermore, Black enrollees were 15.6 percentage points more likely than white enrollees to have uncontrolled high blood pressure. Diabetes: Compared to white enrollees, Asian, Hispanic and Black enrollees were more likely to have diabetes by 6.9 percentage points, 5.6 percentage points, and 5.3 percentage points, respectively, after adjusting for age and sex. The rate of undiagnosed diabetes was approximately 3 percentage points higher for Asian, Hispanic and Black enrollees than white enrollees. Obesity: 42.8 percent of enrollees were classified as obese. After adjusting for age and sex, Black enrollees were more likely to be obese than white enrollees by 13.6 percentage points, while Asian enrollees were less likely to be obese than white employees by 26.2 percentage points.

Widespread variation in Cesarean section (C-section) delivery rates among races reinforce persistent maternal health gaps within the ESI market. Studies have shown that C-section delivery can significantly reduce maternal morbidity and mortality in high-risk deliveries. However, when performed in low-risk situations, C-sections can increase the risk of infections and blood clots and may contribute to unnecessary postpartum complications including death. The analysis showed that 20.1 percent, 17.7 percent, and 17.0 percent of low-risk deliveries among Black, Asian and Hispanic enrollees, respectively, were performed via C-section, compared to a rate of 13.6 percent among white enrollees. After adjusting for differences in age, Black, Asian and Hispanic enrollees with low-risk pregnancies were more likely to undergo a C-section than their white counterparts by 6.5, 3.9, and 3.4 percentage points, respectively. The analysis showed that 20.1 percent, 17.7 percent, and 17.0 percent of low-risk deliveries among Black, Asian and Hispanic enrollees, respectively, were performed via C-section, compared to a rate of 13.6 percent among white enrollees. After adjusting for differences in age, Black, Asian and Hispanic enrollees with low-risk pregnancies were more likely to undergo a C-section than their white counterparts by 6.5, 3.9, and 3.4 percentage points, respectively. Behavioral health and substance use issues were prevalent among all enrollees, however, there were stark differences in severity of these issues and related outcomes for Lesbian, Gay or Bisexual enrollees. The overall rates of anxiety and depression within ESI were 13.3 percent, and 14.1 percent, respectively. After adjusting for age and sex, white enrollees were more likely than Black, Hispanic and Asian enrollees to experience serious psychological distress, by 2.0 percentage points, 1.8 percentage points, and 5.2 percentage points, respectively. The percent of Lesbian, Gay or Bisexual enrollees who reported serious psychological distress was 12.1 percentage points higher, the rate of anxiety was 16.6 percentage points higher and the rate of depression was 18.4 percentage points higher than for straight enrollees after adjusting for age and sex. 19.8 percent of enrollees used tobacco products (inclusive of smoking, vaping, chewing tobacco), 30.1 percent reported heavy alcohol use, and 18.8 percent used illicit drugs, such as marijuana, cocaine, crack, heroin, misuse of pain relievers, stimulants, and tranquilizers, to name a few. Heavy alcohol use was highest among Hispanic enrollees while illicit drug use was highest among white enrollees.

Heavy alcohol use was highest among Hispanic enrollees while illicit drug use was highest among white enrollees. Despite perceptions around the robustness of coverage within ESI, enrollees experience significant barriers to accessing care, particularly for those of racial/ethnic minority backgrounds and individuals with low or modest incomes. Specifically, 6.9 percent of enrollees reported missing medical care due to cost, 9.8 percent reported missing prescriptions due to cost, and 11.9 percent reported difficulty paying medical bills. These numbers vary widely by income. While nearly all enrollees (91.5 percent) reported having have a usual source of care, the analysis showed significant differences in emergency department (ED) utilization – a proxy measure for care accessibility. After adjusting for age and sex, Black enrollees were 4.9 percentage points more likely than white enrollees to have visited an ED; in contrast, Asian enrollees were 4.5 percentage points less likely than white enrollees to have visited an ED. After adjusting for age and sex, enrollees in the lowest income bracket (under $50,000) were 7.1 percentage points more likely than enrollees in the highest income bracket ($150,000 or more) to have visited an ED.

Even with employer-sponsored coverage, some enrollees have unmet social needs that can further exacerbate gaps in health outcomes. More than 7 percent of enrollees were food insecure. After controlling for age and sex, Black and Hispanic enrollees were more likely than white enrollees to be food insecure (by 9.8 and 6.0 percentage points, respectively).

SYDNEY--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Australian midsized businesses are facing challenges rooted in the current labour market, supply chain disruptions and rising prices; yet, in the face of these obstacles, almost all expect growth (94%) and feel confident their businesses will thrive (80%) in the next 12 months, according to J.P. Morgan’s inaugural Australia Business Leaders Outlook Survey released today. “Australian business leaders are finding ways to adapt to the evolving economic landscape,” said Annabelle Mooney, Head of Commercial Banking for Australia and New Zealand, J.P. Morgan. “In spite of headwinds, these midsize companies are primarily optimistic that growth is achievable and are well-positioned to navigate the challenges of today’s uncertain climate.” In a survey of more than 200 senior executives from Australian midsize companies, there is optimism for the year ahead and confidence in their companies’ ability to grow—reflecting higher expectations than their counterparts in the U.S., U.K., Germany and France, according to J.P. Morgan’s recent surveys. They also remain confident in the global and national economy (63%), despite ongoing challenges stemming from the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. The challenges they cited most included a tie between labour concerns (27%) and rising prices (27%), followed by supply chain issues (18%). Their optimistic outlook could in-part stem from the new federal government taking office. In fact, more than half (56%) of Australian business leaders expect the recent election to have a positive impact on their business and just 6% foresee a negative impact, while others remain neutral. “Despite the business environment appearing uncertain for the foreseeable future, we know the Australian business community is resilient and nimble,” said Robert Bedwell, Chief Executive Officer of Australia and New Zealand, J.P. Morgan. “We continue to see these organisations overcome volatility and keep pushing forward with their expectation of growth on the horizon.” Getting Creative to Tackle the Labour Shortage Even as optimism persists, most Australian business leaders (92%) cited feeling the effects of the current labour market as it continues to create obstacles for businesses across the country. As a result of the labour shortage, almost half of current employees (47%) are working more hours, and 44% of midsize businesses are seeing reduced sales/revenue. In the hopes of retaining and attracting top talent, Australian business leaders are implementing: Increased benefits (50%) Upskilling or training opportunities (48%) Flexibility for work location (43%) Flexible working hours (42%) Navigating Shifting Business Concerns, Seeking Growth Supply chain disruptions (36%) and rising prices (27%), including energy and commodity prices, are also among the top challenges facing Australian business leaders for the year ahead. To manage supply chain issues, business leaders are making adjustments to inventory and suppliers by strategically stockpiling (50%), replacing or stopping business with certain suppliers (49%), or increasing prices for goods and services (43%). Managing Impacts of the War in Ukraine While the war in Ukraine continues to be a concern across the globe, nearly half (44%) of Australian business leaders expect the conflict to severely impact their business. Of those who do expect to be impacted, nearly 9 in 10 (88%) believe the impact will continue through the end of the year and more than one-third expect to face supply chain issues (45%), higher energy prices (41%) and higher commodity prices (36%) as a result of the war. Elevating What Success Looks Like Through ESG With companies being held to a higher standard with regard to environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors, more than half (52%) of Australian business leaders expect corporate responsibility to be an increased focus area for their business in 2022. Fortunately, 44% of Australian businesses have a positive outlook on the global focus of ESG, because they believe they’re already meeting the requirements. Of the various ESG focus areas, social factors (43%), diversity, equity and inclusion (41%) and environmental factors (37%) were ranked as most important focus areas to their business strategy in the year ahead. Planning for Succession As Australian businesses prepare for the future, many (75%) are planning or considering a transfer of ownership–with over eight in ten (83%) expecting a complete transition within the next five years. For leaders aiming to transition their business, more than half (61%) plan to transfer it to family either through inheritance (28%), sale (26%) or as a gift (7%).

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--JPMorgan Chase released today a comprehensive report examining the firm’s use of arbitration for legal disputes of certain U.S. employee-related claims and the impact of binding arbitration on its workplace culture. The report follows a successful engagement with and withdrawal of a shareholder proposal by the Nathan Cummings Foundation, which asked the firm’s Board of Directors to oversee a review of the mandatory employee arbitration program. JPMorgan Chase worked with employment law attorneys from the firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman and University of Nebraska Law Professor Kristen Blankley to examine the potential benefits and drawbacks of employee arbitration; fairness and bias in arbitration; discovery in arbitration as compared to litigation; and arbitration and litigation data over the past six years, including time to resolution and outcomes. The review found no basis to believe that the arbitration program impacts JPMorgan Chase’s ability to learn about gaps in the workplace culture or inhibits creating a positive workplace environment. It found that JPMorgan Chase’s policies and procedures for addressing employee concerns and potential wrongful conduct comport with best practices and concluded that arbitration remains a superior method to resolve many disputes between employees and the firm that are not resolved through other means. As noted in the report, JPMorgan Chase has identified potential enhancements to the program and will undertake certain changes, including permitting plaintiff employees to disclose arbitration awards at their discretion.

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--JPMorgan Chase announced five organizations will receive philanthropic commitments of $3 million each to scale innovative climate resilient affordable housing models. This work is part of the firm’s $400 million five-year commitment to improve housing affordability and stability for households of color, particularly in Black, Hispanic and Latino communities. The five organizations will work primarily in Inland Empire CA, Rio Grande Valley, TX, Buffalo, NY, Washington, D.C., and Miami-Dade County, FL with a goal to generate a broader impact on a national level. As part of JPMorgan Chase’s strategy to combat the housing affordability crisis, the firm is supporting organizations advancing innovative housing models that can be successfully scaled throughout the country. Through testing new models and collecting lessons learned, these commitments aim to increase the supply of sustainable and affordable housing for households of color across the U.S., as well as influence key stakeholders in the housing industry, including the public and private sectors. This commitment also reflects how the firm is building on previous experience and insights gained through its unique set of business, data, policy and philanthropic resources to help close the housing affordability gap. The Challenge Against the backdrop of historically high rents and persistent barriers to homeownership rates for communities of color, Americans are facing a housing supply crisis, with a shortage of nearly 3.8 million units nationwide.1 In addition, the climate crisis has adversely affected housing supply, with extreme weather affecting about 1 in every 10 homes in the United States in 2021.2 Low-income Black, Hispanic and Latino households are often concentrated in locations that are highly vulnerable to environmental disasters, subjecting them to effects of the climate crisis and economic uncertainty. “In our efforts to advance an inclusive economy, we remain committed to addressing some of the barriers to affordable housing and homeownership to provide family stability and build generational wealth for households of color,” said Abigail Suarez, Head of Neighborhood Development, JPMorgan Chase. “More households deserve accessible options to homeownership and now more than ever we need equitable, sustainable solutions that better equip communities with affordable, climate resilient housing.” Working with Local Partners to Deliver Impact Today’s announcement will support organizations working to reverse racial inequities and climate risks embedded in the existing housing system. To address the shortage of energy-efficient and climate-resilient affordable housing, the following organizations will each receive $3 million in philanthropic capital to influence housing construction practices: come dream. come build (cdcb) - Rio Grande Valley, TX: cdcb will expand their MiCASiTA program, which offers affordable sustainable homeownership options for rural families of color. This includes constructing and selling modular homes, lowering the home base sales price to 15% less than a stick-built home, enhancing the model’s sustainable features by integrating solar, energy, and water efficiency systems, and expanding into six new locations in other rural Black, Latino, and Indigenous communities. Neighborhood Partnership Housing Services (NPHS) – Inland Empire CA: is building Homes by NPHS, a scalable social enterprise that will increase the supply of affordable housing by building factory-built single-family homes and accessory dwelling units (ADUs) on vacant lots, with anticipated savings of 20% in construction costs compared to site-built homes. NPHS will also increase the number of developers of color who can access factory-built housing and incorporate energy-efficient features and weatherization upgrades into factory-built homes in order to help lower pollutants, stay resilient and adaptive against weather, and lower utility costs. “NPHS is grateful for JPMorgan Chase’s investment which will support the use of factory-built housing technology to increase the supply of affordable homeownership and mitigate the impacts of climate change on low-income homeowners,” stated NPHS CEO, Clemente Mojica. “This grant will expand our reach throughout underserved markets and address the systemic obstacles that have historically impeded households of color from achieving and sustaining homeownership.” To help decarbonize affordable housing, the following organizations will each receive $3 million in philanthropic capital to increase the technical knowledge and financing tools in the housing industry to reduce carbon emissions: Solar and Energy Loan Fund of St. Lucie County (SELF) – Miami-Dade County, FL: SELF aims to increase the supply of resilient and sustainable affordable housing by scaling their climate resiliency and clean energy home improvement program to help homeowners, landlords, developers, and contractors of color access innovative funding to rehab homes, upgrade workforce housing and increase green sustainable, affordable housing supply and building expertise. National Housing Trust (NHT) – Washington D.C. Metro Area: NHT aims to promote decarbonization efforts in the Washington DC metro area by involving residents in program and policy design, providing retrofit technical assistance to owners of buildings to improve resident health outcomes, and engaging decisionmakers and lenders to make public resources and mission-driven capital products more accessible and aligned for decarbonizing affordable housing. NHT also aims to have at least 50% of affordable housing rehabilitation projects in the Washington area incorporate yearly decarbonization measures by 2025. PUSH Buffalo – Buffalo, NY: PUSH Buffalo will advance sustainable affordable housing initiatives by building and rehabbing single-family affordable housing with net zero standards and decarbonizing vacant two-unit buildings with green technology for first time homeownership. PUSH Buffalo will also study the health and utility impact of replacing natural gas with electricity in different aspects of affordable homes to understand the resident experience, inform local residents and connect them to new technology and provide data to the wider ecosystem. JPMorgan Chase will work with the Urban Institute to support grantees in the execution of their strategies and in the testing and scaling of their innovations, which will include measuring impact and sharing insights with the housing industry to advance housing stability and affordability for Black, Hispanic and Latino households. “I am pleased that Urban has this great opportunity to help these innovative changemakers accelerate solutions. Together with JPMorgan Chase, we will support, collaborate with, and spread insights from this new group of field-leading grantees, who are working to expand and decarbonize the country’s housing supply, tackle housing affordability, and address the embedded inequities for households of color in our housing system,” said Urban Institute President Sarah Rosen Wartell. A Firmwide Approach to Supporting Affordable Housing This philanthropic commitment complements the firm’s sustainability efforts to help advance the transition to a lower-carbon future and support community resilience to the climate crisis, as well as the JPMorgan Chase PolicyCenter’s housing recommendations to increase equitable access to stable, affordable housing. Additional firmwide efforts to help close the housing affordability gap include: Since 2021, the firm has committed more than $145 million of its $400 million philanthropic commitment to organizations across the country. This includes low-cost loans, equity and grants to advance housing stability and affordability strategies. For example, the firm’s commitments to Stewards of Affordable Housing for the Future and Housing Partnership Network helped support housing stability of low-income households affected by the pandemic. The program disbursed more than $1.7 million to 19 nonprofit housing providers to support services that helped more than 7,800 families remain housed through the pandemic. For example, the firm’s commitments to Stewards of Affordable Housing for the Future and Housing Partnership Network helped support housing stability of low-income households affected by the pandemic. The program disbursed more than $1.7 million to 19 nonprofit housing providers to support services that helped more than 7,800 families remain housed through the pandemic. To help address two of the biggest barriers to achieving homeownership, Chase expanded its Homebuyer Grant program to offer a $5,000 grant to help customers with closing costs and/or down payment assistance when buying a home in predominantly Black, Latino and Hispanic communities across the country. These commitments are part of the firm’s $30 billion commitment to advance racial equity and drive an inclusive economic recovery that was announced in October 2020.

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--JPMorgan Chase today announced that it is now able to accept government deposits in all 50 U.S. states. This milestone is significant because most states require or encourage banks to have a local branch presence to be eligible to receive or hold government deposits in the state, often described as a qualified public depository. As the only bank to achieve this status today, JPMorgan Chase is expanding its banking services to new states and municipalities, improving accessibility to innovative and secure financial solutions that help public entities operate more efficiently and dedicate more resources to serving their communities. Chase Consumer Banking announced a major expansion effort in 2018 to increase its retail branch presence and by August 2021, Chase opened branches in all of the lower 48 states becoming the first national bank to have a retail presence in the contiguous United States. The market expansion effort was pivotal in the Bank securing today’s distinction. “Being able to accept government deposits in all 50 states has been a multi-year effort and a true testament to our firm’s dedication to the public sector,” said Mike Nevins, Head of Government Banking for JPMorgan Chase’s Middle Market Banking & Specialized Industries business. “We’ve been working with governments since 1799 when Aaron Burr founded the earliest predecessor of JPMorgan Chase, the Manhattan Company, to deliver fresh water to lower Manhattan. We have been serving citizens and governments since our inception and are thrilled at the prospect of building on that strong foundation as we enter new communities.” The expansion benefits public entities as they now have more choices when searching for a financial institution to help with their banking needs. Examples of these entities include cities, counties, school districts and other special districts, like airports, water and transit authorities, tax assessors, public universities, hospitals and community colleges. “Our business is only as strong as our communities, and that’s why we’re committed to deepening our impact,” said Jamie Dimon, CEO and Chairman of JPMorgan Chase & Co. “We’ve done this in many ways, including by extending credit to vital institutions—such as hospitals, governments and schools—that keep the communities where we live and work healthy, stable and vibrant. Expanding our ability to serve states and municipalities across the country is another example of our commitment and an exciting milestone as we continue to focus on making a positive difference in our communities.” Located in communities nationwide, the Government Banking group consists of a dedicated team of bankers that brings specialized knowledge of these complex organizations to serve governments at every level and across all areas of their business. Examples of helping governments innovate and make citizens’ lives easier, include: implementing contactless payment technology in everyday scenarios like public transportation, online digital bill payments, lending for capital projects and essential equipment, and tax and fee collection, among others.

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Chase today announced it is giving Secure Banking customers more flexibility over how they manage their money by providing access to direct deposits up to two days early. Beginning this month, Secure Banking customers will receive access to eligible direct deposits, such as payroll, tax refunds, government benefits, and pensions, up to two business days early. This covers nearly 90 percent of Secure Banking direct deposits. “Millions of customers rely on payday to keep up with their bills, so having early access helps them manage unexpected expenses and avoid potential late fees,” said Jennifer Roberts, CEO of Chase Consumer Banking. “This is another way we are giving customers more value and greater flexibility over their finances.” There is no enrollment required. Secure Banking customers who have direct deposit will automatically receive it up to two days earlier. Customers can sign up for direct deposit alerts to be notified when their money is available in their accounts. Customers who already signed up for direct deposit alerts will be notified via text, email or push notifications when funds have been credited to their account. Chase Secure Banking already helps customers pay bills, cash checks, and send money — all for the same $4.95 monthly service fee. Secure Banking customers: Need no minimum deposit to get started Pay no overdraft fees because they can spend only what they have Have access to 16,000 Chase ATMs and 4,700 branches Can review their account and pay bills through the Chase Mobile app and chase.com Receive text and email alerts to help them monitor their balance and transactions “Secure Banking customers have told us that early access was one of the most appealing benefits we could offer,” said Ryan MacDonald, Head of Growth Financial Products. “At a time when budgets are stretched thin by competing priorities, this is a compelling option to give households more control over how they manage their financial lives.” Chase Secure Banking customers say they save an average of $50 a month on fees, compared to solutions they used before they opened their account. Chase continues to find ways to help customers manage their money. To learn more, visit: www.chase.com/SecureBanking.

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The majority of small and midsize U.S. business leaders anticipate a recession in 2023, according to JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 annual Business Leaders Outlook survey released today. In total, 65% of midsize businesses and 61% of small businesses expect a recession in the year ahead. The heightened recession expectations come as businesses nationwide continue to combat inflation. Nearly all midsize businesses (91%) are experiencing inflation challenges, while 45% of small businesses list inflation as a top challenge for the year ahead, up from 20% one year ago. Inflation has forced small and midsize businesses to re-evaluate approaches to pricing, sourcing materials and running operations and has had widespread impacts, including: Passing Costs onto Consumers: 83% of midsize businesses have passed at least some increased costs onto consumers and buyers, while 68% of small businesses have raised prices on select or all products and services. Rising Business Expenses: 94% of small businesses say inflation has impacted expenses, with 38% noting that expenses have increased by 11% or more. Leading cost drivers for both small and midsize businesses include wages and benefits costs for hiring and retaining employees, shipping and other supply chain-related expenditures, including costs of raw materials. Bracing for Longer-Term Increases: 82% of midsize businesses are likely to continue to increase prices to mitigate costs, while the majority of small businesses expect that higher costs for labor, rents, shipping and materials are here to stay. “Inflation has been a challenging headwind impacting businesses of all sizes, across all industries,” said Ginger Chambless, head of research, JPMorgan Chase Commercial Banking. “While we have seen some encouraging signs that inflation has started to moderate and should cool over 2023, businesses may still want to consider adjustments to strategies, pricing or product mixes to help weather the storm in the near-term.” Mixed Economic Views Despite the shared consensus on a recession in 2023, small businesses remain more optimistic in their economic outlooks than midsize business leaders, who expressed much more downbeat views compared to this time last year. Midsize businesses expressing optimism for the global economy declined to 8% from 34% one year ago and the number optimistic about the national economy fell to 22% from 50% at the start of 2022. Conversely, nearly half of small businesses, which are less likely to have exposure to national and international markets, expressed optimism for the national and global economy at 49% and 45%, respectively, which is similar to last year’s sentiment. High Performance Expectations Small and midsize business leaders’ outlook for their own company’s performance remains high, with 72% of small businesses and 66% of midsize businesses expressing optimism for the year ahead. More than two-thirds (69%) of small businesses expect increased revenue and sales in the year ahead and 65% anticipate greater profits in 2023. Similarly, 63% of midsize businesses expect increased revenue and sales in 2023, and 51% predict greater profits. “Following the challenges of the last few years, it’s encouraging to see the resilience of small business owners and leaders,” said Ben Walter, CEO, Chase Business Banking. “The next economic cycle is always right around the corner, so our role is to help small business owners plan ahead so they can succeed in good times and bad.” Help Still Wanted Concerns of a recession and dimmed economic outlooks largely aren’t restraining 2023 hiring plans, as 51% of small business leaders anticipate hiring full-time employees and 50% of midsize business leaders expect to increase headcount. To hire and retain employees, 67% of midsize businesses plan to increase wages and/or benefits and 43% plan to offer upskilling and training opportunities, while 42% of small businesses expect to increase wages. Small businesses’ primary drivers for full-time hiring plans include expected sales growth and improved financial positions. “While businesses may be cautious in their economic outlooks, their actions display a focus on growth and investing in their employees,” said John Simmons, head of Middle Market Banking & Specialized Industries, JPMorgan Chase Commercial Banking. “Businesses are signaling that they’re practiced in being nimble and prepared for several different scenarios, which are keys to operating effectively in today’s economy.” New Year’s To-Do List Businesses may consider focusing on the following considerations in their 2023 planning: For more information on the Business Leaders Outlook survey, please view the midsize and small business reports. +++ Survey Methodology JPMorgan Chase’s Business Leaders Outlook survey was conducted online from November 14-22, 2022, for small businesses (annual revenues between $100,000 and $20 million) and from November 29 – December 13, 2022, for midsize businesses (annual revenues between $20 million and $500 million). In total, 1,799 business leaders in various industries across the U.S. participated in the survey. For year-over-year trends, current data is compared to data collected in the fourth quarter of previous years. The results of this online survey are within statistical parameters for validity, and the error rate is plus or minus 3.1% for the small business findings and plus or minus 3.5% for the midsize business findings, both at the 95% confidence level.

NUEVA YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--La mayoría de los líderes de las pequeñas y medianas empresas de EE.UU. considera que habrá una recesión en 2023, según la encuesta anual Business Leaders Outlook (Perspectivas de los Directivos Empresariales) 2023 de JPMorgan Chase, publicada hoy. En total, el 65% de las empresas medianas y el 61% de las pequeñas esperan una recesión para el año próximo. Las mayores expectativas de recesión se producen cuando las empresas de todo el país continúan combatiendo la inflación. Casi todas las medianas empresas (91%) están experimentando desafíos inflacionarios, mientras que el 45% de las pequeñas empresas consideran que la inflación es el principal desafío para el año que viene, frente al 20% de hace un año. La inflación ha obligado a las pequeñas y medianas empresas a reevaluar sus métodos de fijación de precios, aprovisionamiento de materiales y gestión de las operaciones y ha tenido repercusiones generalizadas, como por ejemplo: Transferir los costos a los consumidores: El 83% de las medianas empresas han transferido por lo menos una parte del aumento de los costos a los consumidores y compradores, mientras que el 68% de las pequeñas empresas han subido los precios de algunos o todos los productos y servicios. Aumento de los gastos empresariales: El 94% de las pequeñas empresas afirman que la inflación ha afectado los gastos y el 38% señala que los gastos han aumentado un 11% o más. Los principales factores de costos, tanto para las pequeñas como para las medianas empresas, son los salarios y beneficios para contratar y retener a los empleados, el transporte y otros gastos relacionados con la cadena de suministro, en particular los costos de las materias primas. Tener que prepararse para aumentos a largo plazo: El 82% de las medianas empresas probablemente seguirán aumentando los precios para mitigar los costos, mientras que la mayoría de las pequeñas empresas esperan que el aumento de los costos de mano de obra, alquileres, envíos y materiales lleguen para quedarse. ""La inflación ha sido un viento en contra que perjudicó a las empresas de todos los tamaños y sectores"", afirma Ginger Chambless, directora de investigación de JPMorgan Chase Commercial Banking. ""Si bien hemos visto algunos signos alentadores de que la inflación ha comenzado a moderarse y debería enfriarse a lo largo de 2023, es posible que las empresas todavía tengan que evaluar la posibilidad de reajustar las estrategias, los precios o las combinaciones de productos para ayudar a capear la tormenta en el corto plazo"". Puntos de vista económicos mixtos A pesar del consenso generalizado sobre la probabilidad de que haya una recesión en 2023, las pequeñas empresas siguen siendo más optimistas en sus perspectivas económicas que los líderes de las medianas empresas, quienes expresaron opiniones mucho más pesimistas en comparación con el año pasado por estas fechas. Las empresas medianas que expresan optimismo respecto a la economía mundial descendieron al 8% desde el 34% de hace un año y el número de optimistas sobre la economía nacional cayó al 22% desde el 50% a principios de 2022. Por el contrario, casi la mitad de las pequeñas empresas, que son menos propensas a tener exposición a los mercados nacionales e internacionales, expresaron optimismo por la economía nacional y mundial en un 49% y 45%, respectivamente, es decir, cifras similares a las del sentimiento del año pasado. Expectativas de alto rendimiento Las perspectivas de los líderes de las pequeñas y medianas empresas sobre el rendimiento de su propia empresa siguen siendo altas: un 72% de las pequeñas empresas y un 66% de las medianas empresas expresan optimismo para el próximo año. Más de dos tercios (69%) de las pequeñas empresas esperan un aumento de los ingresos y las ventas en el próximo año y el 65% anticipan mayores ganancias en 2023. Del mismo modo, el 63% de las medianas empresas esperan un aumento de los ingresos y las ventas en 2023 y el 51% predice mayores beneficios. ""Luego de los desafíos de los últimos años, es alentador ver la resiliencia de los propietarios y líderes de las pequeñas empresas"", aseguró Ben Walter, gerente general de Chase Business Banking. ""El siguiente ciclo económico siempre está a la vuelta de la esquina y por eso, nuestra función es ayudar a los propietarios de las pequeñas empresas a planificar con anticipación para que puedan tener éxito en los buenos y en los malos tiempos"". Aún se busca ayuda Las preocupaciones por una recesión y las perspectivas económicas atenuadas en gran medida parecen no están restringiendo los planes de contratación de 2023, ya que el 51% de los líderes de las pequeñas empresas anticipan contratar empleados de tiempo completo y el 50% de los líderes de las medianas empresas esperan aumentar la plantilla. Para contratar y retener a los empleados, el 67% de las medianas empresas tienen previsto aumentar los salarios y/o los beneficios y el 43% tienen previsto ofrecer oportunidades de mejora de las competencias y de capacitación, mientras que el 42% de las pequeñas empresas esperan aumentar los salarios. Los principales factores que impulsan los planes de contratación de tiempo completo de las pequeñas empresas son el crecimiento previsto de las ventas y la mejora de la situación financiera. ""Si bien las perspectivas económicas de las empresas pueden ser prudentes, sus acciones demuestran que ponen el foco en el crecimiento y la inversión en sus empleados"", subrayó John Simmons, director de Banca de Mercado Medio e Industrias Especializadas, JPMorgan Chase Commercial Banking. ""Las empresas reflejan que tienen práctica en ser ágiles y estar preparadas para situaciones de lo más diversas, que son las claves para operar con eficacia en la economía actual"". Lista de tareas para el año nuevo Las empresas pueden considerar concentrarse en las siguientes consideraciones en su planificación para 2023: Para más información sobre la encuesta Business Leaders Outlook (Perspectivas de los Directivos Empresariales), consulte los informes sobre pequeñas y medianas empresas. +++ Metodología de la encuesta La encuesta Business Leaders Outlook (Perspectivas de los Directivos Empresariales) de JPMorgan Chase se realizó en Internet del 14 al 22 de noviembre de 2022 para pequeñas empresas (ingresos anuales entre 100.000 y 20 millones de dólares) y del 29 de noviembre al 13 de diciembre de 2022 para medianas empresas (ingresos anuales entre 20 y 500 millones de dólares). En total, participaron 1.799 directivos empresariales de diversos sectores de Estados Unidos. Para trazar las tendencias interanuales, los datos actuales se comparan con los reunidos en el cuarto trimestre de años anteriores.

MUMBAI, India--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Almost all (91%) Indian midsize business leaders are expecting their revenues to rise this year, and more than 84% are anticipating their profits to also climb, according to J.P. Morgan’s inaugural India Business Leaders Outlook survey released today. “Even with concerns over rising costs and a competitive business environment, Indian midsize business leaders are strikingly confident about this year,” said Pranav Chawda, Head of Commercial Banking, India, J.P. Morgan. “The survey results help us to anticipate that India will continue on an upward trajectory as businesses explore new and advanced distribution channels internationally, along with forging strategic partnerships and looking for investment opportunities to grow.” In a survey of more than 300 senior executives from Indian midsize companies, many are confident in the global (63%) and national (68%) economy in the year ahead. Amid the notable optimism, 78% of Indian midsize business leaders are experiencing inflation challenges and rising costs for their businesses—and a large majority expect capital expenditures (76%) and capital needs (82%) to rise, and are therefore scaling their business activities accordingly. “We are happy to see that the post-pandemic progress is likely to continue in India as midsize businesses are taking the necessary steps to navigate through global recessionary pressures, high inflation, and supply chain uncertainties that will continue this year,” said Kaustubh Kulkarni, Senior Country Officer, J.P. Morgan India and Vice Chair, Asia Pacific. Establishing Positive Working Environments With optimism at the forefront, 81% of Indian midsize business leaders expect to increase or preserve their company’s headcount over the next 12 months. Of those planning to add or maintain headcount, they’re combatting the current labor environment and make hiring and retaining strong talent possible by taking some intentional measures through: Giving employees flexibility on where they work (64%) Increasing wages and benefits (60%) Offering flexible work hours (57%) Offering upskilling/training opportunities (56%) Combatting Inflation and Rising Costs In spite of the local optimism, business leaders are facing challenges and navigating obstacles. Like most businesses across the world, inflation continues to be a major hurdle for Indian businesses with nearly eight in ten (78%) experiencing increased business costs driven by supply chain issues (69%), raw materials (67%) and energy (65%). To account for inflation, Indian business leaders indicate they are watching prices more closely (53%), making changes to purchasing to reduce expenses (50%), and prioritizing the production, delivery and sale of their most profitable products (49%). Additionally, 61% are passing on up to half of their increased costs to consumers—and almost all (94%) say they will continue to do this in the year ahead. On a positive note, nearly half (46%) of business leaders sharing that supply chain pressures have improved over the past 12 months. This is generally a result of businesses adding new suppliers from new geographies (55%), allocating more funds to cover increased costs related to moving products (55%), and shifting manufacturing and distribution closer to key markets (51%). Elevating What Success Looks Like Through Corporate Responsibility In the year ahead, business leaders have assigned paramount importance to corporate responsibility factors, citing social (74%) and environmental (64%) factors, and diversity, equity and inclusion (64%) as most important to their business strategies. Top outcomes of these corporate responsibility efforts are rooted in improving employee retention (63%), and enhancing marketing and finding new customers (60%). Planning for the Future As Indian midsize businesses prepare for the future, two thirds (66%) plan to introduce new products and services, nearly six in ten (58%) plan to expand into new geographical markets domestically, and more than half (55%) plan to expand into new distribution channels over the next 12 months. “Indian midsize company leaders’ business transfer strategies range from short-to-medium-to long term,” says Chawda. “Depending on the time horizon, the transfer method ranges from dilution through a Private Equity raise, to going public—and many transferring to family.” Nearly three quarters (74%) of Indian midsize business leaders are planning or considering a full or partial transfer of business ownership. And of those, the top business transfer method cited is to family or through a gift (32%)—and the majority (91%) expect this transfer to be complete in the next two years.

SYDNEY--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The majority of Australian midsize business leaders are grappling with rising costs and challenges driven by inflation (71%). At the same time, nearly six in ten (59%) feel confident about the global and national economy, and expect their revenue (77%) and profits (74%) to increase in the year ahead, according to J.P. Morgan’s second annual Australia Business Leaders Outlook survey. “Australian business leaders continue to demonstrate their resilience as they skillfully manage various geopolitical and economic obstacles,” said Annabelle Mooney, Head of Commercial Banking, Australia and New Zealand, J.P. Morgan. “While they see potential for growth in the year ahead, they’ve had to be nimble, adopting and deploying new strategies in response to changing market conditions.” In a survey of 200 senior executives of Australian midsize companies, the theme of optimism is clear with less than half (46%) of local business leaders expecting a recession in 2023—reflecting lower expectations than their recently surveyed counterparts in the U.S. (65%), U.K. (69%), India (61%), Germany (59%) and France (53%). “As we continue to withstand a complex and evolving economic environment, Australian midsize business leaders are proving once again that they have the agility to keep pushing forward and combat the challenges that arise,” said Robert Bedwell, Chief Executive Officer, J.P. Morgan Australia and New Zealand. Mitigating Inflation and Supply Chain Disruptions With headwinds of elevated inflation spanning economies around the world, seven in ten (71%) Australian midsize business leaders have experienced rising costs as a result. Of those facing inflation challenges, over two-thirds (67%) report that the increased cost of energy, as well as rising interest rates and cost of capital (61%) are driving higher business costs. The top ways decision makers are tackling inflation are through raising prices (43%), automating more processes (43%) and changing their pricing models (42%). To further mitigate costs, nearly half (45%) of Australian midsize companies are passing up to one-quarter of their increased costs onto consumers—with more than eight in ten (83%) saying they are likely to continue increasing prices. In response to supply chain disruptions, less than half of respondents (40%) note that pressures have gotten worse over the past 12 months, and one-third (33%) say they have gotten better. To counteract ongoing supply chain challenges, business leaders are allocating more funds to cover increased costs related to moving products (41%) and shifting manufacturing and distribution closer to key markets (41%). Navigating a Tight Labour Market The Australian labour environment remains top of mind for midsize business leaders, with over half (52%) expecting to add headcount in the next year. As they contend with a high demand for labour, of those preparing to hire more, they are: Offering flexible work hours (54%) Giving employees flexibility on where they work (51%) Offering upskilling and training opportunities (51%) Increasing wages and benefits (49%) Elevating What Success Looks Like Through Corporate Responsibility In the year ahead, Australian midsize business leaders are focusing on the importance of corporate responsibility factors, citing social (57%) and environmental (51%) factors, and diversity, equity and inclusion (57%) as most important to their business strategies—up 14%, 14% and 16% respectively from 2022. Top outcomes of these corporate responsibility efforts are rooted in improving employee retention (52%) and building company culture (50%), up 4% and 11% respectively from last year. Preparing for the Future As Australian midsize business leaders prepare for the future, over half expect to expand into new distribution channels (53%) and new geographical markets domestically (51%), and plan to introduce new products and services (44%). Six in ten business leaders shared they are not planning to sell or transfer ownership at this time, up 36% from 2022. For leaders considering a full or partial transfer, 30% intend to sell to a third party or management group—with 19% planning to transfer to family through a gift, up 12% from 2022.

This is in spite of less than half (46%) of U.K. midsize business leaders feeling upbeat about the global economy in the year ahead, down 20% from 2022—and nearly seven in ten (69%) bracing for a recession in 2023, more than any other country polled in this year’s survey. “We know 2022 was a challenging year for many businesses as they tried to recover from the pandemic amid fierce economic headwinds, and this upcoming year will bring its own set of challenges,” said Catherine Pierre, Head of Commercial Banking, U.K., J.P. Morgan. “However, it’s heartening to see the resilience U.K. decision makers are showing by focusing on recession-proofing and remaining optimistic about growth. It gives hope that U.K. businesses can weather the storm ahead and emerge on the other side stronger.” In a survey of more than 300 senior executives from U.K. midsize companies, many are feeling confident in what they can control: their own companies. Nearly three in four (73%) business leaders say they’re optimistic about their company’s performance, down 7% from 2022, and nearly nine in ten (89%) expect their revenues to increase or remain the same in the year ahead. “While optimism for the greater economy may have trended down, local decision makers are still planning for a brighter future with expected business growth,” said Vis Raghavan, Chief Executive Officer EMEA, J.P. Morgan. “British business leaders are pragmatic and are having to make strategic decisions with challenging choices given the current cards dealt and what’s expected ahead.” Energy Prices Threaten Business Success While businesses are focusing on resilience, they remain concerned about threats beyond their control. The top threat: Energy prices were cited as the biggest external threat to businesses by a quarter (25%) of respondents, overshadowing general market volatility (15%), the cost of debt and interest rates (13%) and threats of competition (11%). The business impact: Seven in ten business leaders concerned by inflationary challenges and rising costs reported that the increased cost of energy was making doing business more expensive, far outstripping the pressures of rising interest rates (53%) and increasing costs of raw materials (56%). The consumer impact: With costs soaring from inflation, almost half (48%) said they’d already had to raise prices. Many (68%) have raised prices up to 50%, while just under a quarter (22%) of those who’ve had to raise prices have done so by between 51% and 75%. Supply Chain Challenges Lead to Business Change Although energy price concerns dominate, supply chain issues remain. Supply chain woes: While some acute supply chain problems linked to the pandemic and Brexit have faded from the headlines, nearly two thirds (63%) of business leaders say supply chain pressures have worsened in the last year. A similar number (62%) say increased costs related to supply chain issues are driving the cost of business higher. Nearshoring: As supply chain worries worsened throughout the year, more U.K. businesses have taken decisive action to address it with nearly half (42%) moving manufacturing and distribution nearer to their key markets, up 12% from 2022. Other adjustments: Nearly half (46%) are now allocating more money to cover rising costs of moving products, up 10% from 2022, and less than one third (32%) have taken to strategic stockpiling to manage the issues. The Rise of the ‘S’ in ESG The range of considerations for business leaders is broad and the focus on environmental, social and governance (ESG) measures remains strong. In fact, social concerns around employees and customers now match the concern for environmental issues. Increased focus on social standards: Social factors like customer satisfaction, workplace health and safety and data privacy were reported by 56% as important to their business strategy, up 25% from 2022. They now rank as highly as environmental factors (56%), like reducing carbon emissions and energy efficiency. The benefits: The most commonly cited reason for the focus on corporate responsibility was to improve employee retention (52%). Cited nearly as often were the desire to reinforce the company’s position in the community (51%) and to enhance marketing and find new customers (49%). Business Transitions Decline As Leaders Hold On Through Tough Times The number of leaders with no plans to sell or transfer ownership of their company in the next year has increased significantly to 45%, up 16% from 2022. Future plans: Among those considering a full or partial transfer, more than half (56%) are seeking to do so through a sale or gift to family, and 74% expect the transition to be complete withing the next two years, up 24% from 2022.

PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Selon la deuxième édition de l’enquête annuelle de J.P. Morgan, France Business Leaders Outlook (Perspectives des dirigeants d'entreprises françaises), plus de la moitié des dirigeants d’entreprises de taille moyenne françaises se sentent optimistes quant aux perspectives économiques mondiales (58 %), nationales (56 %) ainsi que locales et régionales (55 %) pour l'année à venir. Pour autant, 53 % d'entre eux s'attendent à une récession en 2023 et se préparent à ses répercussions, un taux moins élevé que leur homologues européens au Royaume-Uni (69 %) et en Allemagne (59 %). « Les défis auxquels les entreprises françaises de taille moyenne et à croissance rapide ont été confrontées ces dernières années les ont préparées à faire face à une incertitude accrue pour l'année à venir », a déclaré Olivier Simon, responsable de la banque commerciale de J.P. Morgan France et Benelux. « Les décideurs d'entreprise continuent de démontrer leur capacité à s'adapter rapidement aux défis tant locaux qu’internationaux et à les surmonter. » Dans une enquête menée auprès de plus de 250 cadres supérieurs d'entreprises françaises de taille moyenne, les dirigeants d'entreprise continuent de faire preuve de confiance et de résilience. Bien que beaucoup se préparent à une récession en 2023, près des trois quarts (72 %) prévoient de maintenir ou d’accroître leurs effectifs au cours de l'année à venir, plus des deux tiers (68 %) des dirigeants d’entreprises de taille moyenne françaises s'attendent toujours à une augmentation des revenus et des ventes, et six sur dix (61 %) prévoient une hausse des bénéfices. « De nombreuses entreprises françaises ont dû s'adapter au paysage actuel, caractérisé par une inflation élevée et d'autres contraintes externes », a déclaré Kyril Courboin, Président de J.P. Morgan France. « Bien qu'ils s'attendent concrètement à de véritables difficultés à venir, les dirigeants d'entreprises françaises sont restés assez optimistes quant aux prévisions de croissance des entreprises. » Faire face à l'inflation et relever les défis de la chaîne d'approvisionnement Alors que l'inflation continue d'être un défi majeur pour les entreprises dans le monde entier, plus de la moitié (56 %) des dirigeants d'entreprises françaises ont, en conséquence, été confrontés à une augmentation des coûts. L'impact observé : Parmi ceux confrontés à des problèmes d'inflation, deux tiers (67 %) déclarent que l'augmentation du coût des matières premières, ainsi que l'augmentation du coût de l'énergie (62 %), entraînent une hausse des coûts opérationnels et commerciaux. La réponse apportée : Pour aider à équilibrer, la plupart des dirigeants (70 %) indiquent qu'ils compensent jusqu'à la moitié de l'augmentation de leurs coûts en la répercutant sur le consommateur. Parmi ceux-ci, 85 % sont enclins à continuer à augmenter leurs prix dans l'année à venir. De plus, de nombreux dirigeants font également état de difficultés persistantes en matière de chaîne d'approvisionnement, 63 % d'entre eux indiquant que la situation s'est dégradée au cours des 12 derniers mois. Délocalisation à proximité ou ’Nearshoring’ : En réponse, 35 % des dirigeants d'entreprises françaises de taille moyenne continuent de déplacer la fabrication vers de nouvelles zones géographiques, et plus de 30 % ajoutant désormais de nouveaux fournisseurs issus de nouvelles zones géographiques, une tendance qui s'est quelque peu accélérée à partir de 2022. Autres ajustements : Les dirigeants d'entreprise sont également légèrement plus nombreux (38 %, soit 5 % de plus qu'en 2022) à augmenter leurs allocations de fonds pour couvrir les coûts plus élevés liés au déplacement des produits, tandis qu'une part similaire modifie les matériaux ou les procédés de fabrication. Naviguer l'incertitude énergétique, un défi majeur pour la communauté entrepreneuriale française Les prix de l'énergie sont considérés comme la principale menace extérieure par un tiers (33 %) des dirigeants d'entreprises françaises, ce qui reste le taux le plus élevé parmi leurs homologues européens : 25 % au Royaume-Uni et 23 % en Allemagne. En conséquence, les entreprises ayant indiqué que les prix énergétiques constituaient leur principale menace externe prévoient d'investir dans des sources d'énergie renouvelables (69 %) au cours de l'année à venir. Relever les défis du marché du travail et répondre aux urgences sociales et environnementales Les décideurs français continuent de naviguer sur le marché complexe de l'emploi et les pénuries de main-d'œuvre, et la plupart d'entre eux prévoient d'augmenter (41 %) ou de maintenir (31 %) leurs effectifs au cours du prochain exercice. Pour aider à conserver et à attirer les talents, les dirigeants d'entreprise répondent aux attentes des employés en : Augmentant les salaires et les avantages sociaux (46 %) Offrant une certaine souplesse en matière d'horaires et de lieu de travail (43 %) Investissant dans des technologies d'automatisation (43 %) Proposant des horaires de travail flexibles (42 %) La responsabilité sociale de l'entreprise reste également une priorité pour les dirigeants d’entreprises de taille moyenne françaises, qui accordent une importance accrue aux facteurs environnementaux tels que la réduction des émissions de carbone, la gestion des déchets et l'efficacité énergétique (54 %, soit 21 % de plus qu'en 2022), notamment en raison de la crise énergétique actuelle et des stratégies de conservation déployées dans toute la France. En outre, 44 % affirment que le fait de se concentrer sur les facteurs énergétiques et environnementaux a permis à leur entreprise d'établir ou de renforcer leur positionnement au sein de leur communauté, suivi par l'amélioration du marketing et la recherche de nouveaux clients (43 %). Les affaires dans l'année à venir Pour l'année à venir, les décideurs se concentrent sur l'expansion sur de nouveaux marchés — tant nationaux qu'internationaux (respectivement 46 % et 42 %) — ainsi que sur la priorité donnée aux produits et services rentables (40 %) et à l'introduction de nouveaux produits (32 %). La majorité des dirigeants d'entreprises françaises ont en outre mis en place des plans de transition complets ou partiels, un tiers d'entre eux prévoyant de céder leur entreprise à leur famille (50 %, soit 10 % de plus qu'en 2022) ou de la vendre à une tierce partie ou à un groupe spécialisé dans la gestion des ventes (33 %). La grande majorité (67 %, soit 23 % de plus qu'en 2022) s'attend à ce que ces transitions se produisent dans les deux prochaines années.

PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--On par with last year, more than half of French midsize business leaders are feeling optimistic about the global (58%), national (56%), and local and regional (55%) economic outlook in the year ahead, according to J.P. Morgan’s second annual France Business Leaders Outlook survey released today. This is in spite of 53% expecting a recession in 2023—a lower rate than their European counterparts in the U.K. (69%) and Germany (59%)—and gearing up for its repercussions. “The challenges faced by French midsize and fast-growing companies over the last several years have prepared them for dealing with heightened uncertainty in the coming year,” said Olivier Simon, Head of Commercial Banking, France and Benelux, J.P. Morgan. “Business decision makers continue to demonstrate their ability to quickly adapt to global and local challenges and overcome them.” In a survey of more than 250 senior executives from French midsize companies, business leaders continue to showcase their confidence and resiliency. In spite of many bracing for a recession in 2023, nearly three-fourths (72%) plan to maintain or add additional headcount in the year ahead, more than two-thirds (68%) of French midsize business leaders are still expecting an increase in revenue and sales, and six in ten (61%) foresee a rise in profits. “Many French companies have had to adjust to today’s landscape of high inflation and other external pressures,” said Kyril Courboin, Head of France, Senior Country Officer, J.P. Morgan. “Though they have practical expectations of the real threats ahead, French business leaders have remained fairly optimistic with expectations for business growth.” Responding to Inflation and Navigating Supply Chain Challenges As inflation continues to be a top challenge for the business community globally, more than half (56%) of French business leaders have experienced rising costs as a result. The business leader’s impact: Of those experiencing inflation challenges, two-thirds (67%) report that the increased cost of raw materials, as well as the increased cost of energy (62%) is driving higher business costs. The business leader’s response: To help compensate, most leaders (70%) indicate they are offsetting up to half of their increased costs by passing them along to the consumer. Of those, 85% are likely to continue increasing prices for their consumers in the year ahead. Additionally, many business leaders also report continued supply chain challenges, with 63% noting that it has worsened over the past 12 months. Nearshoring: In response, 35% of French midsize businesses leaders are continuing to shift manufacturing to new geographies, and more than 30% now adding new suppliers from new geographies, a trend that has somewhat accelerated from 2022. Other adjustments: Slightly more business leaders (38%, up 5% from 2022) are also increasing their allocation of funds to cover higher costs related to moving products while a similar share is changing materials or manufacturing processes. Navigating Energy Uncertainty, A Top Challenge for the French Business Community Energy prices are considered the top external threat by one-third (33%) of French business leaders, which remain the highest among their European counterparts: UK (25%) and Germany (23%). As a result, companies who noted energy prices as their top external threat plan to invest in renewable energy sources (69%) in the coming year. Responding to Labor Market Challenges and Addressing Social and Environmental Urgencies French decision makers continue to navigate the complex job market and labor shortages, and most expect to either add to (41%) or maintain (31%) headcount over the next 12 months. To help retain and attract talent, business leaders are responding to employee expectations by: Increasing wages and benefits (46%) Providing flexibility on work hours and location (43%) Investing in automation technology (43%) Offering flexible work hours (42%) Corporate social responsibility also remains a priority for French midsize business leaders, who place increased importance on environmental factors like reducing carbon emissions, waste management and energy efficiency (54%, up 21% from 2022), particularly in light of the current energy crisis and conservation strategies being rolled out across France. In addition, 44% claim that focusing on energy and environmental factors has enabled their company to establish or reinforce their positioning within the community, followed by enhancing marketing and finding new customers (43%). Business in the Year Ahead In the upcoming year, decision makers are focused on expansion into new markets—both domestic and international (46% and 42%, respectively)—as well as the prioritization of profitable products and services (40%) and introduction of new products (32%). Additionally, the majority of French business leaders have a full or partial transition plan in place with one-third planning to transfer to family (50%, up 10% from 2022) or sell to a third party or sales management group (33%). The vast majority (67%, up 23% from 2022) expect these transitions to take place in the next two years.

FRANKFURT, Germany--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Optimism is falling among German Mittelstand leaders, with nearly six in ten (59%) expecting a recession in 2023, and more are feeling pessimistic about the global (24%) and national (28%) economy compared to last year, according to J.P. Morgan’s third annual Germany Business Leaders Outlook survey released today. “As uncertainties persist into the year ahead, it does not come as a surprise that business leaders have a more subdued outlook on the economy,” said Bernhard Brinker, Head of Commercial Banking, DACH Region, J.P. Morgan. “At the same time, however, we recognize that Mittelstand companies are resilient and have taken thoughtful precautions to navigate through this uncertain environment.” In a survey of more than 250 senior executives of German Mittelstand companies, many leaders still expect their business to grow in revenue (69%) and profits (59%), though these figures are down 10% and 14% respectively from 2022. More than half (56%) expect capital expenditures to increase, down 10% from 2022, with nearly two out of three expecting capital needs (64%) to also increase. “While companies are bracing themselves for a harsher business climate, we see that the German Mittelstand community is tackling the economic challenges proactively and continues to have conviction about the strength and success of their businesses,” said Stefan Povaly, Head of Germany, Senior Country Officer, J.P. Morgan. Adapting and Solving for Persistent Business Challenges Business challenges like supply chain issues were evident throughout 2022, with nearly six in ten (57%) leaders citing that supply chain pressures have gotten worse over the past 12 months. To account for this, those experiencing supply chain pressures are allocating more funds to cover increased costs related to moving products (45%), focusing on strategic stockpiling (40%) and are near-shoring by shifting manufacturing or distribution closer to their key markets (39%). While those experiencing higher costs of doing business cite increased cost of energy (77%) as the biggest driver, nearly a quarter (23%) of Mittelstand leaders see energy prices as the number one external threat or risk to their business. Notably, nearly seven in ten (69%) companies still face inflation challenges, and more than half (53%) have raised prices to account for inflation. Of those who have raised prices, the largest share (36%) is passing along 26%-50% of their increased costs on to their consumers. This trend is likely to stay, as a vast majority (83%) of those passing along costs plan to continue to do so. Creatively Attracting and Retaining Top Talent In the midst of continued economic headwinds, 39% of Mittelstand leaders are planning to add headcount and 38% plan to maintain their current headcount in the year ahead. In light of the current labor environment, Mittelstand leaders planning to add or maintain headcount are taking a variety of measures to attract and retain talent through: Increasing wages and benefits (52%) Offering flexible work hours (51%) Offering upskilling and training opportunities (44%) Investing in automation technology (40%) Continued Search for Growth as Attitudes Toward Ownership Change Mittelstand companies continue to look for ways to generate growth and secure the future of their business. When asked about their plans for the next 12 months, almost half of Mittelstand leaders said they are planning to grow their business by expanding into new geographical markets both internationally (43%) and domestically (41%), developing strategic partnerships or investments (42%) and expanding into new distribution channels (41%). Unlike previous years, 55% of Mittelstand leaders are not planning to sell or transfer ownership of their company in the next 12 months, up 25% from 2022. Of those who have a transition plan in place, 36% plan to transfer to family through a sale, up 23% from 2022—and notably less (27%) plan to sell to a third party or management group if they’re transferring ownership, down 17% from 2022. Nearly eight in ten (78%) of those considering a full or partial transfer expect it to take place within the next two years, up 32% from 2022. Elevating What Success Looks Like Through Corporate Responsibility In the year ahead, Mittelstand leaders are focusing on importance of corporate responsibility factors, citing social (56%) and environmental (49%) factors, and governance (48%) as most important to their business strategies—up 15%, 9% and 19% respectively from 2022. Top outcomes of these corporate responsibility efforts are rooted in enhancing marketing and finding new customers (54%) and establishing the company’s position within the community (51%).

WILMINGTON, Del.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, on National Lose the Jet Lag Day, the United Family of Cards from Chase announced that it has teamed up with Timeshifter, the world’s most advanced circadian technology platform, to launch the “Jet Set & Reset” pledge and Sweepstakes* designed to help travelers understand and tackle the underlying cause of jet lag - a nemesis to great travel. Exclusive to United MileagePlus® members, those who take the “Jet Set & Reset” pledge to take on jet lag in 2023 will be entered into a Sweepstakes for a chance to win a prize from three potential prize categories that help turn those pledges into action: One (1) winner will receive a year-long subscription to the Timeshifter jet lag app and 1 million United MileagePlus miles, the ultimate package for more and better travel experiences. Eight (8) people will receive a year-long subscription to the Timeshifter jet lag app and 500K United MileagePlus miles. 500 pledge takers will win a year-long subscription to the Timeshifter jet lag app, which provides highly personalized plans for managing jet lag. “The United Family of Cards from Chase brings more and better travel to the world through card rewards and benefits, and the turn of the new year is the perfect time to commit to getting the most out of travel,” said Laurinda Rainey, General Manager of United Co-Brand Cards at Chase. “We are excited to launch this Sweepstakes on National Lose the Jet Lag Day to raise awareness of the impact jet lag has on travel.” According to Timeshifter, jet lag causes significant human and financial costs – from poor concentration and reduced productivity to less enjoyment and weakened immune function. Timeshifter debunks common jet lag myths and replaces them with real science, allowing travelers to control circadian rhythms by taking small actions at specific times to ensure they arrive at their best. “When I was an astronaut, we learned how to shift our circadian rhythms to prepare for rocket launches and spacewalks. Because our circadian clock regulates our sleep, alertness and almost all other biological systems in our body, it was key to our safety, performance and health,” said Mike Massimino, former NASA Astronaut and Timeshifter Advisor. “It’s gratifying to see circadian science finally being applied outside of NASA to equip travelers to tackle jet lag, and I applaud Chase and United for shining a light on jet lag health with their ‘Jet Set & Reset’ campaign.” The Timeshifter jet lag app was developed with world-renowned scientists, led by Associate Professor at Harvard Medical School and Timeshifter’s Chief Scientist, Dr. Steven W. Lockley, based on the latest research in sleep and circadian neuroscience. The app provides users with highly personalized jet lag plans based on their normal sleep pattern, chronotype, itinerary and personal preferences. “We want United flyers to enjoy their travel experiences on and off the plane, and our United Family of Cards from Chase help people maximize their travel,” said Marketing & Loyalty VP and MileagePlus President, Luc Bondar. “We’re excited to kick off the new year with an opportunity for travelers to take on jet lag and commit to getting the most out of their travel in 2023. With our expanded network reach this year, travelers have more access to their favorite destinations and new places they have yet to visit.” Take the pledge to enter the Sweepstakes, and learn tips for overcoming jet lag by visiting: https://jetsetreset.chase.com.

ATLANTA--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Chase leaders and community partners cut the ribbon on a new Community Center branch in the Summerhill neighborhood of Atlanta, the first of its kind in the city and one of only 16 Community Center branches nationwide. The Summerhill Community Center, located at 9 Georgia Ave SE – at the corner of Hank Aaron Drive – aims to expand access to banking, tools and advice that helps customers get on a path to financial health and resilience. The branch features a strong team of local financial health experts focused on community engagement, mentorship and advice. The location looks and feels different from a “typical” bank – it combines a modern design, spacious layout, and the latest banking technology, reflecting how customers engage with Chase today. Offerings include: Specialty financial health workshops on topics such as budgeting, credit and homeownership, for both individuals and groups Free one-on-one mentorship support to help local entrepreneurs grow, start or expand their small business A community “living room” area to serve as event space for partner nonprofits Complementary Wi-Fi for community groups and individuals on-site All Community Center branch programming is complementary and open to Chase customers and non-customers alike. This community-inspired bank model is part of the firm’s $30 billion Racial Equity Commitment to help close the racial wealth gap. “Atlanta’s growth and prosperity in recent years has exceeded all expectations, but more people need to be part of the opportunity this city represents,” said Jamie Dimon, CEO, JPMorgan Chase. “Our Summerhill Community Center branch is our stake in the ground to fuel opportunity for more residents, especially underserved populations. At the same time, we are also growing our presence here through jobs and branches, which will have a direct impact on strengthening the local economy.” To build the new Summerhill Community Center, Chase contracted with FS 360, a Black-owned building firm in Atlanta. FS 360 also built the Chase Lounge at the Russell Center and has since built more than seven spaces for Chase in Georgia, Florida and South Carolina. The cost of construction for a new branch ranges from about $1 - 1.5 million per branch, and all labor and resources are locally sourced when possible. “The opening of this center provides a physical space for the community to tend to their financial health, grow their small businesses and more,” said Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens. “Thank you to Jamie Dimon and JPMorgan Chase for their partnership in assisting our Administration’s vision of building stronger neighborhoods.” To better engage with community members, Chase has hired talented professionals from the Atlanta metro area in new roles to the bank including: Community Managers, Mathilda Lambert, a lifelong Atlanta native, will engage the Summerhill community and its surroundings to increase awareness of financial health resources, and host interactive programs on topics such as goal setting, budget building and understanding credit. Lambert is one of four Community Managers in the Atlanta metro region. Branch Manager, Kevin Brown, a 26 year resident of Atlanta and a 9 year veteran of Chase, will oversee all aspects of the Summerhill branch including traditional banking services and local community engagement. Senior Business Consultants, Rashida Winfrey and Shea Taylor, will provide access to complementary 1:1 business coaching, technical assistance and advice to hundreds of Atlanta entrepreneurs and minority small business owners on everything from boosting creditworthiness to managing cash flow to effective marketing. “The Summerhill Community Center may look like just a building to some, but for others—those who have not had access to financial health and support resources – it represents possibility and opportunity,” said Brigitte Killings, Chase’s Community and Business Development Director for the South. “We look forward to delivering on the promise this Community Center branch represents for the people of Summerhill and the city of Atlanta.” Our Community Impact Since 2021, the firm has made more than $10.5 million in philanthropic commitments in the region – including a $2.4 million commitment to Atlanta Neighborhood Development Partnership (ANDP) announced in 2022. Using the funds from JPMorgan Chase, ANDP is developing 173 affordable single-family homes for homeownership. Of the 50 homes sold to date, nearly 50% of the homebuyers earned 80% or less of the area median income and nearly 90% of the buyers were Black or Latino. In addition, as the official bank sponsor of the Atlanta Hawks, the two organizations have partnered on multiple community-focused initiatives including: Project Rebound: Chase is the presenting sponsor of this initiative which provides basketball and fitness equipment to youth organizations and schools in high needs communities. Second Chance: The Hawks and Chase have also partnered to provide funding for the Center for Employment Opportunities, an Atlanta-based nonprofit which provides employment services for people with past records in Atlanta. “Our partnership with Chase goes well beyond the walls of the arena into communities like Summerhill and throughout greater Atlanta,” said Grant Hill, Vice Chair of the Board of the Atlanta Hawks. “Chase demonstrates its commitment to Atlanta daily through our joint initiatives like Project Rebound and Second Chance, both of which strengthen Atlanta’s underserved people and communities. We look forward to seeing that commitment grow through this space and the people in it.” Serving Atlanta’s Small Businesses According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, Georgia is home to 1.1 million small businesses – more than 1/3 of which are minority-owned. A core function of the Atlanta Community Center is supporting those businesses and helping them grow and succeed. In 2021, Chase launched a program to support minority entrepreneurs and hired Senior Business Consultants in 21 cities, including Atlanta, to provide minority business owners with free one-on-one advice and coaching. Since its launch, the small business mentorship program has mentored 4,000 minority business owners, including Atlanta's hometown coffee brand, Hot Coffee, and hosted over 1,200 events. “Building a relationship with my bank has opened opportunities for me to grow and manage my business that I might not otherwise have had,” said Kat Taylor, founder and CEO of Hot Coffee. “As my business has grown, my Senior Business Consultant was able to connect me with other small business owners facing similar challenges as well as experts in things like bookkeeping and accounting, enabling me to focus my time on marketing my products and serving my customers.” Growing in Atlanta Chase also announced it plans to open 15 more branches to greater Atlanta, bringing its total to 110 branches by 2024. Approximately 30 percent of these branches will be in low-to-moderate income communities. The firm also plans to grow its workforce locally by one-third by hiring 500 new employees by the end of 2025. To accommodate this growth, the company is adding 40,000 square feet of office space at the Monarch Tower in Buckhead. New jobs in the market include roles with the firm’s Atlanta -based technology team - including software engineers, developers, architects, as well as to support and build a new phone-based Personal Wealth Advisors team, among other hiring needs.

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”) announced today its replacement rate for certain outstanding floating rate and fixed-to-floating rate debt securities and certificates of deposit issued by JPMorgan Chase, JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the “Issuers”) that are linked to U.S. dollar LIBOR ICE Swap Rates (“USD LIBOR ISR”) of one or more tenors. In March 2021, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (“ARRC”) suggested a fallback formula (the “ARRC fallback formula”) for USD LIBOR ISR that consists of using the U.S. dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate (“USD SOFR ISR”), adding the tenor spread adjustment for 3-month U.S. dollar LIBOR of 0.26161% per annum and applying technical adjustments to account for differences in payment frequency and day count conventions between USD LIBOR and SOFR swaps. On June 8, 2022, the ARRC recommended that calculation agents consider the ARRC fallback formula in determining successor rates for USD LIBOR ISR where a legacy position cannot be proactively converted and its fallback provisions cannot be amended. In the case of any of the above securities or instruments that permit the calculation agent to select a successor rate following the discontinuation of USD LIBOR ISR, the calculation agent has determined that, for the purposes of calculating any payment on any such securities or instruments that is to be determined using one or more USD LIBOR ISR after June 30, 2023, any such USD LIBOR ISR will be replaced by the USD SOFR ISR for the same tenor as such USD LIBOR ISR, subject to the adjustments, including the 0.26161% per annum tenor spread adjustment, in accordance with the ARRC fallback formula. In the case of any of the above securities or instruments that permit the calculation agent to make a determination of the relevant rate in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner if any applicable dealer poll does not yield a rate following the discontinuation of any USD LIBOR ISR, the calculation agent has determined that, for the purposes of calculating any payment on any such securities or instruments that is to be determined using one or more USD LIBOR ISR after June 30, 2023, it will reference the same replacement rate described above. This announcement does not apply to any USD LIBOR ISR-linked securities or other instruments issued by the Issuers that are not governed by New York law and that do not settle through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company.

Concerns about Jamie Dimon's departure are premature; the focus should be on JPM's ambitious European expansion with Chase, which shows promising growth potential."

Underlying conditions are improving, and management meaningfully boosted net interest income guidance for 2025, but regulatory reform could be an even bigger boost to longer-term growth and profitability.

Close U.S. stock futures are pointing lower as investors ready for today's tariffs announcement expected from President Donald Trump after markets close; Tesla (TSLA) is slated to report first-quarter deliveries amid a downturn for its stock; Visa (V) reportedly is offering a payment of roughly $100 million to get Apple's (AAPL) credit card payment network business; and USDC stablecoin issuer Circle files for an IPO. Here's what investors need to know today. 1. US Stock Futures Dip as Investors Await Tariffs Updates U.S. stock futures are pointing lower following a volatile trading session as investors await White House tariff plans expected to be announced later today. Market watchers are also following today's private sector payrolls release ahead of Friday's job report. Nasdaq futures are 0.8% lower after the tech-focused index gained 0.9% Tuesday. Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 futures are lower by about 0.5%. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is down slightly at around $85,000. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is down below 4.15%. Oil futures are down. Gold futures are slightly higher. 2. Investors Brace for Trump Tariffs Announcement After Markets Close President Donald Trump is set to unveil his latest tariffs proposal at a White House event slated to start at the close of markets at 4 p.m. ET. Trump's advisers continue to hash out the details surrounding the new tariffs he plans to implement ahead of the ""Liberation Day"" event, Bloomberg reported. While Trump has said he was seeking reciprocal tariffs to match import taxes on U.S.-made products, a report in The Washington Post indicated that advisers were also mulling a 20% tariff on nearly all imported products. 3. Tesla Stock Slips Ahead of Quarterly Deliveries Data Tesla (TSLA) shares are down 2.5% in premarket trading ahead of the electric vehicle maker's expected release of its first-quarter deliveries data this morning. Analysts expect Tesla to report 393,000 deliveries, up less than 2% year-over-year but fewer than last quarter's 495,570 vehicles. The data comes as analysts have raised concerns that CEO Elon Musk's work with the Trump administration is creating distractions and impacting Tesla's business. Tesla shares have shed one-third of their value in 2025. 4. Visa Offers Apple $100M to Take Over Credit Card Network, Report Says Visa (V) is offering a payment of roughly $100 million to get Apple's (AAPL) credit card network business, according to The Wall Street Journal. The report said that Apple would select a payment provider before selecting a bank to take over its credit card from Goldman Sachs (GS), and that Visa is competing with Mastercard (MA)—which is ""fiercely trying to keep its role as the network on this card""—and American Express (AXP). The Journal previously reported that JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Synchrony Financial (SYF), Capital One (COF) and American Express were in the running to take over as the issuer of the credit card. 5. USDC Stablecoin Issuer Circle Files for IPO Circle, the company behind the dollar-backed USDC stablecoin, has filed for a U.S. initial public offering (IPO). In its prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Circle said it plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under ticker symbol ""CRCL."" Circle, which had previously announced plans to go public in 2021 via a SPAC merger, said its 2024 net income was $155.7 million, down from $267.6 million a year earlier.

Building an optimal credit card strategy ahead of a major purchase requires more than just interest rates, though that is a key consideration. You should also balance rewards and examine your credit health. Start by selecting a card with a strong rewards program in your purchase category and then pre-qualify to avoid hard inquiries, ensuring approval odds match your FICO score. Preferably that will be north of 700. Next, secure a 0% APR intro offer to spread payments without interest, saving hundreds of dollars on your purchase, and then pay your bill on time. You will want to keep your credit utilization below 30% (for example, only use $1,500 on a $5,000 limit) to boost your score. Also try to stack a sign-up bonus for extra value. After you make your purchase, automate minimum payments, but then pay off your balance aggressively before the introductory period ends. This maximizes rewards, minimizes costs, and strengthens your credit. The situation This is more of an introduction to using your credit wisely, but there are really advanced options who want to make the best use of their credit availability. A Redditor on the r/CreditCards subreddit recently looked for advice on starting a two-player setup, which is where partners, spouses, or close allies coordinate their credit card usage to maximize rewards, bonuses, and financial benefits. One strategy might be to seek out the Chase Trifecta and Capital One Savor cards for their compelling options, but to also understand bonus categories as critical to unlocking their full potential. Chase Trifecta The Chase Trifecta comprises the Chase Sapphire Preferred, which has a $95 annual fee, Chase Freedom Unlimited, and Chase Freedom Flex, both of which have no fee. The represent a powerhouse for versatility. The Sapphire Preferred earns 3x points on dining and travel, with a 60,000-point sign-up bonus that is worth $750 in travel after you spend $4,000 in three months. Points transfer one-for-one to partners like United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), amplifying their value by 25% through Chase’s portal. The Freedom Unlimited adds 1.5x points on all non-bonus spending, while the Freedom Flex offers 5x on rotating quarterly categories such as groceries up to $1,500. Together, they cover broad spending options &#8212; travel, dining, and everyday costs &#8212; while pooling points for outsized redemption. The flexibility to shift points to travel or cashback cushions rising costs. For a two-player setup, one partner can wield Sapphire while the other uses Freedom cards, splitting duties to hit bonuses and diversify earnings. Capital One Savor Meanwhile, the Capital One Savor (also a $95 annual fee) shines for dining enthusiasts, offering 4% cashback on dining and entertainment. You can get $200 back on $5,000 in restaurant spend annually. Its 3% on groceries and streaming complements a food-focused lifestyle, and a $300 bonus after spending $3,000 in three months sweetens the deal. Unlike Chase’s points, Savor’s cashback is simpler, suiting those who prefer immediate rewards over travel planning. Pairing it with a no-fee card like Capital One Quicksilver (1.5% on all purchases) creates a lean duo, though it lacks Chase’s transfer flexibility. Understanding the bonus opportunity Bonus categories are the linchpin. Chase’s 5x quarterly caps demand proactive planning. If you activate them late or overspend the spending limit, you will find yourself squandering their potential. Savor’s 4% dining edge shines for restaurant buffs, but fades if your big purchase &#8212; say a $5,000 appliance &#8212; falls outside of food or entertainment, and nets just 1%. It is critical to understand your spending habits. A travel-heavy lifestyle favors Chase, while foodies should lean toward Savor. Pre-qualifying ensures approval without dinging your credit, especially vital if you have a major purchase looming. Pairing with a 0% APR card, such as Chase Slate Edge, which gives you 18 months to pay off the balance, stretches payments interest-free and saves you hundreds of dollars on hefty purchases. For sheer value and adaptability, Chase Trifecta triumphs with its point ecosystem. For dining out, though, Savor reigns supreme. But aligning categories with your actual spending habits unlocks the true payoff.

What is &#8220;the best card that can give me the max amount of cash back for everyday purchases like gas etc?&#8221; This is the question posed in our next drawing from the Reddit mailbag. Our caller today, let&#8217;s call her &#8220;Gwen,&#8221; is a young adult fresh out of college and off to a good start with a credit score of 746 (which FICO considers &#8220;very good&#8221;), but looking for a better credit card to maximize her cash back. Gwen is rocking a Chase Freedom Student card at present, a holdover from her college days that Chase Bank actually no longer offers. The Chase Freedom Student has been phased out and replaced by a similar card that&#8217;s now called &#8220;Chase Freedom Rise.&#8221; It&#8217;s not a bad card as cashback cards go. It doesn&#8217;t charge any annual fee for example. But it only pays 1.5% cash back on purchases, which these days is really the absolute minimum you should demand in a cash back card. Long story short, Gwen can do better. Let&#8217;s help her out with that. .keypoints-box { margin-bottom: 20px; } Key Points No one credit card is best for cash back. A good cash back strategy includes a single all-around card paying 2%, supplemented by multiple cards paying more cash back for specific kinds of purchases. The Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express pays 6% cash back for gas grocery and streaming purchases, but it does charge an annual fee. The right cash back credit card can earn you hundreds, or thousands of dollars a year for free. Our top pick pays up to 5% cash back, a $200 bonus on top, and $0 annual fee. Click here to apply now (Sponsor) Ordinarily, my advice when picking cash back cards is to go for a mixed approach, holding one card that pays a decent cash back rate on all purchases in all categories, with no limit on the cash back you can earn, and no annual fee. Any of several major branded credit cards fit this bill, including The Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) Active Cash card, Citi (NYSE: C) Double Cash, and SoFi&#8216;s (Nasdaq: SOFI) Unlimited 2% credit card. This all-around &#8220;good enough&#8221; card should then be paired with a handful of other cards that pay less than 2% for what Gwen might call &#8220;etc&#8221; purchases, but more than 2% for specific categories of purchases where she spends heavily. Whenever making one of these specific purchases, Gwen would switch out her good-enough card, and use one of these credit cards tailored to the specific purchase she&#8217;s making, be it gas, or groceries, or restaurants for example. Good options for this part of the package might include Bank of America&#8216;s (NYSE: BAC) Customized Cash card, which lets a cardholder pick one category of purchase to receive 3% cash back on; or Citi&#8217;s Custom Cash card, which let&#8217;s you pick a category to receive 5% cash back (albeit, only up to $500 in purchases per month). Is the Blue Cash Preferred Card a good cash back card? Gwen seems to be thinking along these same lines as well, asking specifically if she should ditch her Chase Freedom Student card in favor of the Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express (NYSE: AXP). So should she? My first instinct is to say &#8220;no&#8221; without thinking, because unlike all of the cards I&#8217;ve named above, the AmEx card charges a $95 annual fee (after the first year). But on further reflection, the Blue Cash Preferred Card idea may have some merit, especially when used in conjunction with a second, good-enough card. Why? Well, consider this: The Blue card pays a superb 6% cashback on grocery purchases, 6% more on &#8220;select&#8221; streaming subscriptions, and 3% on gas stations. It pays only 1% cashback on everything else, but Gwen already has a card that she can use for everything else, her Chase card, and it pays 1.5%. The question really comes down to this: Will Gwen spend enough on groceries and streaming, to cover the $95 annual fee, and still give her more cash back than she&#8217;d get if she used a different card (or cards) paying only 3% on groceries and streaming? It&#8217;s not too hard to answer that question, though. First, we need to know how much Gwen pays for groceries and streaming in an average month. Is it $500? If so, then at 6% cashback she&#8217;s getting $30 back a month on those purchases, or $360 a year, instead of the $15 a month, or $180 a year, she&#8217;d be getting with a 3% cash back card (or cards). The difference between $360 and $180 ($180), is more than the $95 annual fee, so Gwen is actually getting a good deal in this case. Conversely, if Gwen spends only $200 a month on groceries and streaming, her cashback at 6% is $144 a year. Minus the $95 annual fee, she&#8217;s netting only $49 cash back, which is less than the $72 she&#8217;d get on a 3% cashback card with no annual fee. In that case, she&#8217;s better off finding a different card, and leaving the AmEx card to bigger spenders.

Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Markets Look Up 2:17 pm by Gerelyn Terzo Wall Street is determined to end the week on a positive note, as all three of the major stock market averages make their way decidedly into the green. The Nasdaq Composite is leading the charge with a 1.8% advance, followed by the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average, which are up 1.6% and 1.4%, respectively. China is apparently ready to come to the negotiating table on tariffs, infusing optimism into an otherwise confused stock market today. The Nasdaq Composite is being led by stocks like Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL), Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) and Apple Materials (Nasdaq: AMAT) today. At the current pace, the Nasdaq Composite is looking at a 7% gain for the week, giving it a year-to-date advance of about 3%. Whipsaw Trading 12:18 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The markets are seeing green as of early afternoon trading in what has been a whipsaw trading session for investors. All three of the major stock market indices are now seeing green, but there is a lack of conviction in either direction today. The Nasdaq Composite is being lifted by stocks like Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) and Linde (Nasdaq: LIN), with gains of 3% and 2%, respectively. While the latest wholesale price data shows inflation is waning, policymakers aren&#8217;t convinced. NY Fed official John Williams predicts economic growth will slow to a mere 1% in 2025, blaming tariffs for what he expects could result in 4% inflation by year-end. Stocks Flip Green 10:00 am by Gerelyn Terzo As of mid-morning trading, the stock market has turned higher, with all three of the major stock market averages now seeing green. Most sectors of the economy are now trading higher, led by materials and technology, each of which are up about 1%. The economy is still uncertain, but inflation is headed in the right direction &#8211; lower. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink warned on CNBC that a recession might have already reared its head in the U.S. economy. Here&#8217;s a look at where things stand at last check: Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 198.68 (+0.48%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 129.17 (+0.79%) S&amp;P 500: Up 24.31 (+0.40%) The markets remain fearful, falling modestly at the open across the board amid what JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has called a turbulent economy. Dimon also warned that S&amp;P 500 earnings estimates are going to be revised downward as corporate American continues to cancel their current outlooks, some of which have already begun to do so. He expects that American banks will be in the crosshairs of the trade wars. Markets are also weighing some better than expected economic data on the inflationary front. Wholesale price declined by 0.4% last month, yet another indication of waning inflation as the Federal Reserve gears up for its May meeting on interest rates. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 305.83 (-0.77%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 78.09 (-0.44%) S&amp;P 500: Down 32.54 (-0.66%) Market Movers It&#8217;s a tale of two markets for the chip stocks today. Texas Instruments (Nasdaq: TXN) is falling a steep 8.9% to about its 52-week low level. The stock was trading in the $200 area last month to currently hover at $142 per share. On the flip side, Advanced Micro Devices (Nasdaq: AMD) is gaining 4.3% today to nearly $94 per share. The stock was well over $100 per share in recent weeks and has been volatile. Earnings season has begun. Financial stock Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) reported better-than-expected Q1 profit results, sending shares up about 1%. The company&#8217;s results were fueled by robust stock market trading, leading to a record performance in that business. Advertising technology company AppLovin (Nasdaq: APP) shares are under pressure today, falling 6% to below $250 per share as the tug-of-war in that stock continues to unfold.

Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Broader Markets for the Win 2:41 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The broader markets are headed for the win column, with the S&amp;P 500 currently gaining 1.5% alongside a rising Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite. If the gains hold, the S&amp;P 500 is on pace for a 5.4% gain this week after taking investors on a roller coaster ride. China is looking ready to negotiate on tariffs, filling in the missing piece of the tariff puzzle that has kept things interesting this week. Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM) and Monolithic Power (Nasdaq: MPWR) are the top gainers of the day, while Texas Instruments (Nasdaq: TXN) and Intel (Nasdaq: INTC) are laggards. First quarter earnings season is officially underway, which could insert another round of uncertainty. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned that corporate America would be revising their outlooks downward. But for now, the markets will take the win. Stocks Show Backbone 12:30 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The broader markets are now moving higher, with all three of the major stock market indices trading in the green. It&#8217;s been a topsy turvy trading session as the markets process improving inflation data, faltering consumer confidence and fears of a recession. Fed Official John Williams is stoking fears of inflation rearing its head to the tune of 4% by year-end 2025, pointing to the tariffs as the negative catalyst. He also warned that economic growth could slow to below 1%. S&amp;P 500 component Fastenal (Nasdaq: FAST), which distributes construction supplies, is rising by 6% today after increasing its prices in response to the tariff effect. The company also declared a $0.44 dividend, up from $0.39 previously, alongside its Q1 results. Roller Coaster Ride 10:30 am by Gerelyn Terzo The markets remain under pressure after the University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey showed weakness. Just about every sector of the economy is now in the red after a mixed showing earlier this morning. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon expects corporate America to renege on their earnings outlooks, while BlackRock CEO Larry Fink believes an economic recession is brewing. Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) reported better-than-expected Q1 profits on strong trading volumes. The markets are continuing their roller coaster ride this morning, going from red to green and then back again. This wild week on Wall Street has seen it all, as a perfect storm of trade wars, recession talk and economic uncertainty dominate the headlines. At last check, all three of the major stock market averages were under pressure while sector performance is split between winners and losers. On the economic front, wholesale prices fell more than expected last month, a welcome surprise and an indication of waning inflation. Before the markets had much of a chance to celebrate, another round of economic data swung the other way. Consumer sentiment is down in April, according to the latest University of Michigan poll, as investors lose sleep over the trade war and inflation. The hits keep coming, as JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned he expects that S&amp;P 500 earnings estimates will be changed to the downside amid a turbulent economic backdrop. Not to be outdone, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink would not be surprised if there is already a recession emerging in the economy. China has lifted its tariffs on U.S. imports to 125% as the trade war saga continues to unfold. Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) has kicked off Q1 earnings season with stronger than expected profits, buoyed by high trading volumes. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 166.15 (-0.42%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 106.23 (-0.63%) S&amp;P 500: Down 29.27 (-0.56%) Market Movers Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM) is extending its rally, rising 7% on the day as investors flock to safe-haven assets like gold. Wall Street firm UBS upgraded its rating on NEM to buy with a $60 price target attached. The stock is currently hovering at just over $54 per share. Farmland and ag stock The Mosaic Company (NYSE: MOS) is up 4.6% today. MOS shares are nearing their 52-week high as investors flock to commodity-related stocks.

Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Another market reversal 1:03 pm by Joel South U.S. stock markets advanced, with the S&amp;P 500 increasing by 1.4%, the Dow rising 484 points (1.2%), and the Nasdaq gaining 1.7%, even as trade disputes and weak consumer confidence fueled earlier fluctuations. This rebound follows China&#8217;s imposition of 125% tariffs on U.S. products, contributing to persistent uncertainty after a turbulent week sparked by U.S. tariff announcements. The stock market is shrugging off the latest salvo between the U.S. and China over trade. All stock indices opened slightly higher at the morning bell, with the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO) up 0.7%. China raised its tariffs on U.S. goods to 125%, matching the rate President Trump had imposed on Chinese imports. Beijing, though, said it no longer matters what further increases the U.S. hits it with as it will not respond because &#8220;Given that, at the current tariff level, U.S. exports to China are no longer commercially viable, China will not respond to any further tariff hikes by the U.S. on Chinese goods.&#8221; With Trump having essentially eliminated the de minimis rule that Chinese marketplaces like Temu and Schein used to ship cheap goods to the U.S. duty-free, it&#8217;s not unreasonable to say trade between the U.S. and China is dead. Big names bolster market Although most components of the Vanguard ETF are down, the biggest components of the index are moving higher. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), representing the second largest position in the exchange-traded fund at over 6%, is up more than 2%, helping to drive the ETF higher. Even though top dog Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is in the red, it is almost at break-even so its impact is negligible. Yet some components are up strongly in morning trading. Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), which is the eighth largest position, is up 3.4%. The AI chipmaker&#8217;s stock has held up better than most over the tumultuous week with shares 22% higher. Banking on trading turmoil What is buoying stocks this morning are the results of bank stock earnings starting to come in with giants like JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) reported record revenue on higher trading despite caution over economic headwinds. JPM stock represents 1.5% of VOO&#8217;s portfolio, just behind 10th place Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) at 1.6%. JPMorgan is up 2% in morning trading. Other financial stocks in the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF that reported earnings today include Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), both of which had better than expected results. Yet banks were also being very cautious and were setting aside larger amounts for credit losses. It suggests they foresee tougher times coming and are preparing for the worst. JPMorgan&#8217;s provision for credit losses in the fourth quarter rose to $3.3 billion from $2.6 billion. Wells Fargo&#8217;s provision, however, was lower than expected. It set aside $932 million, less than the $1.2 billion Wall Street wass anticipating. Morgan Stanley&#8217;s credit loss provision was just $135 million, but it is markedly higher than the $6 million et aside in its year-ago first quarter.

It’s a real-world truth that your first credit card, especially if you get it while in high school or college, will likely be a fairly basic card. Yes, some rewards might be available, but they will be limited compared to the type of cards you can get today. .keypoints-box { margin-bottom: 20px; } Key Points Upgrading your current card is a relatively simple process, provided you have established some credit history. If you stick with your current issuer, you should be able to make an easy transition. The downside of sticking with the same bank might be losing our on bonus miles or points. The right cash back credit card can earn you hundreds, or thousands of dollars a year for free. Our top pick pays up to 5% cash back, a $200 bonus on top, and $0 annual fee. Click here to apply now (Sponsor) If you have a more basic credit card, the good news is that if you have a good payment history and are looking to get yourself something that can offer you more travel benefits, you should absolutely take that step. You could easily be on your way to more travel rewards. What To Know One of the most important things to know is that you are likely to have the best luck upgrading your card to another option in your issuers current lineup. For example, if you have a more introductory Chase card, you might consider upgrading to another card in the Chase lineup that focuses more on travel. The benefit of doing so is that you can avoid having a hard credit hit on your credit card, which can temporarily lower your credit score. Most people experience this when they apply for new credit with a new bank, and it&#8217;s a definite annoyance. However, the downside might be that you don’t get to take advantage of any signing bonuses that are available. Many credit cards, especially travel cards, will offer you bonus number of miles or points if you spend a certain amount in the first 90 days. This is usually a very attractive offer, and losing it can be a shame, but you have to balance this against the hard credit inquiry. How To Upgrade Same Issuer Once you have settled on a new credit card to consider, the next step is to determine whether you want to stay with the same issuer or another issuer. Depending on the option, your next steps will be slightly different. If you stay with the same issuer, you just have to call the number on the back of your credit card and ask about upgrade options. The benefit of calling and talking to someone might be taking advantage of new card sign-up bonuses, as you might get lucky. On the plus side, if you stay with a current issuer, you might get a slightly higher credit limit if you have a good payment history. This credit history could be utilized to determine whether your issuer feels you qualify for a higher balance, which could also result in a hard inquiry. New Issuer If you don’t want to use the same issuer, it’s as simple as applying for a new card online after you settle on which card you want. The hope is that you have narrowed down whether you want a credit card that focuses on miles, hotels, or just general travel points that can be used for any type of travel. Another good reason to go with a new issuer is that many websites will let you know via a pre-approval link, something you may get in the mail or through email. This will help you know which credit card might approve you with better perks and a higher balance. There is also the bonus of using a pre-approval link as a soft credit inquiry. If you don’t get approved, you don’t have to worry about a hard hit on your credit when you try to apply for another credit card from another issuer. What To Do With Your Old Card Once you apply for and receive a new card offering better travel benefits, you must decide what to do with your old card. In most cases, you should pay off the balance and leave it alone, which translates to just throw it in a drawer. Unless you plan on applying for a mortgage, rent, car, or anything requiring a credit inquiry, you can pay off the balance and not worry about canceling the card anytime soon.

JPMorgan is a high-quality bank with strong fundamentals, superior profitability, and a solid business profile, giving it a competitive edge over peers. Despite strong performance, JPMorgan's valuation remains high, trading at a premium compared to peers, and recent market volatility adds uncertainty to its outlook.

JPMorgan's Q1 2025 results show strong performance with a 9% YoY net income increase, despite rising credit costs and macroeconomic headwinds.

In the world of cash-back credit cards, Chase and Capital One are undoubtedly two of the best places to start. With various credit cards offering a myriad of benefits and perks, there is every reason to consider either of these card issuers when looking for something great. Key Points Shopping websites are available to both Capital One and Chase credit card holders. The Capital One site is arguably much easier to use and has more partners available. The Chase website does offer seasonal offers and strong notification alerts. The right cash back credit card can earn you hundreds, or thousands of dollars a year for free. Our top pick pays up to 5% cash back, a $200 bonus on top, and $0 annual fee. Click here to apply now (Sponsor) One Redditor explains why these two brands are so favored by pointing out that Chase and Capital One have specialized shopping websites. Both of these websites offer cardholders discounts at various retailers and the opportunity to earn even more cashback. The Concern What initially concerns this Redditor is that the variety of offers was just jarring when they logged into their Chase and Capital One shopping portals. The original poster immediately noticed that Capital One had over 100 offers while their Chase account only had 14, which was a surprising difference. To be fair, this individual is new to Chase, which is likely why they are seeing so few offers, but it’s concerning that this isn’t immediately clear to this individual as a new Chase customer. A few comments in the Reddit post immediately highlight that once you have been a Chase customer for a while, the company learns your shopping habits and will show you more offers. There is a bit of a caveat here, as the Redditor admits they were able to find more offers and discounts eventually, but they wrote the post after they only saw the initial small selection of cashback offers. As a longtime Chase cardholder, I can verify that I could log in myself and see a similar number of offers compared to Capital One, but with the same caveat that they are not easy to find. The Offers Capital One If you are not familiar with either of these portals, as the Redditor is pointing out, both Chase and Capital One offer shopping portals that anyone with a card can join. In fact, with Capital One, the shopping portal is public, but having an existing card login helps you get directly into the portal setup. Once you are logged in, it’s immediate that Capital One is focusing on getting your attention upfront with big names like up to 5% back at Walmart, 2% at Apple, 7% at Macy’s, 13% at Best Buy, and so on. The thing with Capital One and what makes it such an attractive shopping portal is that the big names continue with Target, Dick’s, Home Depot, Lowe’s, and dozens more of your favorite retailers. Chase Unlike Capital One, which is open to the public, the Chase shopping portal requires you to log in with a Chase account. Once you are in, you have a vastly different setup that makes it a lot harder to identify where your offers are. I’m very familiar with the Chase site, and finding a complete list of offers still takes several clicks. There is no question that Capital One is more user-friendly. This said, Chase offers also seem to lack the same level of big names, or at least from what is immediately apparent. You’ll still see Dell, Office Depot, Lenovo, BackCountry, and other names like Samsung, but the &#8220;star power&#8221; isn&#8217;t there as far as retailers. Still, it takes a lot more searching on the website to find these offers, which ties directly back to the original poster’s concern that Chase seems lacking. Which Is Better? In some ways, Chase has a leg up by highlighting offers for Spring Deals, which is a nice addition to its portal page. They also allow me to choose a set of favorite shopping categories like tech, home, beauty, etc. However, I still have to agree with the original poster and highlight that Capital One’s layout is far easier to navigate, but it’s also easier to pick which offers are online and which are in-store, a distinction I couldn’t find on the Chase site. This distinction makes a big difference because I saw Petco offering me up to 7% cash back with my Capital One card. I purchased dog food there, so a benefit just appeared right before me that I immediately wanted to take advantage of it. Chase is upfront about special deals, seasonal sales, and bonus offers, but everything is more difficult to navigate, making it a more frustrating shopping experience. Even if Chase were to offer a slightly higher percentage than Capital One, trying to find it might be enough of a headache that I would choose Capital One and skip the headache.

The Criteria With an income of over $300,000 and a FICO score of 800, this Redditor hopes to get a solid travel card that allows them to use points for domestic and international travel. Currently, they are okay with category-specific cards but do not favor rotating-category cards, which knocks some of the more popular cashback cards off the board. While they only travel once per year, either domestically or internationally, they have an international trip already planned, so it would be ideal to have a card they could use to rack up some points this year. As far as expenses, they have their once-yearly travel plans, a $5,000 monthly mortgage, a $500 HOA, and $350 in monthly utilities, none of which are paid by card. There is also a Costco membership, but this really isn’t a factor, and they already have a Costco Citi Visa, BoA unlimited cash rewards, BoA customized cash rewards, and a Discover card. So, after considering the AMEX Platinum and Bilt cards, they are still waiting to find something better. However, it’s worth noting that in the comments, they clarify that they are okay with an annual fee and the option to downgrade if they find themselves traveling less. The Options AMEX Platinum Among the top recommended options is a card that the original poster is already considering. The American Express Platinum card has a $695 annual fee, which is a definite negative, but it also has many bonuses to help offset this charge. However, before getting into the benefits, it&#8217;s worth knowing that the attractive 80,000 membership reward point bonus requires $8,000 in eligible purchases over 6 months. While we don’t know precisely what the Redditor spends monthly, this should be manageable based on their overall income and general spending habits. With this card, you get a $155 Walmart+ credit, a $200 hotel credit every year, a $240 digital entertainment credit, and a $200 airline fee credit, which means the $695 annual fee is offset by $900 in value when you also get a $15 Uber Cash credit every month. Capital One Venture X Another solid option for this Redditor might be the Capital One Venture X card. While it has a $395 annual fee, it offers a $300 annual travel credit, a $120 Global Entry or TSA PreCheck credit, 10,000 bonus miles (equivalent to $100) every year, and 75,000 bonus miles after you spend $4,000 in the first three months. Earning 10X miles on hotel and car rentals, 5X miles on flights, and 2X miles on all other purchases, this Redditor should have more than enough time to spend and save for their once-yearly big trip. Plus, you get access to more than 1,300 lounges, which could be beneficial if and when the original poster goes international and wants a nicer place to sit and wait for their flight. Chase Sapphire Preferred Among Chase’s best cards, this one offers an outstanding balance between general and travel spending, making it a top option. The Chase Sapphire Preferred has a $95 annual fee but offers 100,000 bonus points with just $5,000 in spending after 90 days, a pretty strong bonus overall. In addition, you get $200 in partner value from Chase partners, $50 statement credits every year when booking through Chase Travel, and 25% more value when rewards are redeemed for travel. To earn rewards, you can earn 2X on all travel purchases, 3X on dining out or taking in, 3X points on grocery purchases, and 3X on streaming services, so rewards can quickly add up.

Asking 'why' repeatedly is crucial for investors to understand the root causes of macroeconomic shifts and avoid being blind sided by market disruptions.

Key Points Warren Buffett is a long-term investor by nature, and only invests in those business models that are simple to understand. He is not one of those investors who keeps his strategy private; Buffett has been transparent along his investment journey. We’ve identified a trio of ETFs that fit his strategy and therefore would likely receive Buffett’s stamp of approval for the average investor in July. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Everybody wants to invest like Warren Buffett, and rightfully so. The Omaha of Nebraska has amassed a fortune of $145.3 billion as of mid-2025 since making his first investment at the ripe age of 11. Now that he&#8217;s 94 years old, Buffett has become better with age, making him one of the most successful investors who ever lived. Fortunately, Buffett has shared investment nuggets along the way from which investors can glean to build their own winning strategies, formulas that fit both their risk tolerance, financial goals and budget. While Buffett is known for investing in individual stocks, those whose business models are simple enough to understand, he is ultimately an investor who is in it for the long haul. Similarly, ETFs are designed to let investors ride the market wave without having to make frequent changes if they don&#8217;t want to. That is why we believe we&#8217;ve identified three ETFs that Buffett himself would approve of for the average investor in July. iShares U.S. Financials ETF (IYF) Considering Warren Buffett&#8217;s inaugural investment was famously in a bank—Cities Service preferred shares—and financial institutions remain a lighthouse for his investment decisions, it makes sense to begin our exploration here. Our first pick: the iShares U.S. Financials ETF (IYF). And with Buffett&#8217;s own Berkshire Hathaway counted among this ETF&#8217;s top holdings, it would likely appeal to the Oracle of Omaha. In addition to banks, IYF targets exposure to the insurance sector, playing into the hands of Buffett&#8217;s affinity for insurance, which he has called the &#8220;engine&#8221; that has powered Berkshire Hathaway&#8217;s performance for decades. The IYF ETF boasts a lineup of colossal financial institutions like JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) and Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC), offering investors access to stable banks renowned for their robust balance sheets. These titans of finance have a demonstrated history of navigating—and profiting through—evolving market cycles. This resilience can significantly benefit investors, especially when these institutions commit to enhancing shareholder value through activities like stock buybacks. Even in economic climates with elevated interest rates, banks often find an advantage, benefiting from higher loan rates for borrowers while simultaneously attracting savers with compelling yields. Investors have also been betting on the likelihood of lower interest rates, a phenomenon that could take hold as soon as July at the next Fed meeting. This optimism has benefited the iShares U.S. Financials ETF, sending the fund to revisit its 52-week high level of approximately $123 recently, offering investors an opportunity to potentially ride this wave in July. As of early July, the IYF ETF has delivered returns of 10.8%, nearly doubling the S&amp;P 500&#8217;s returns of 6.75% over the same stretch. Over the past year, this financials ETF boasts a total return of 19.5%, in line with its benchmark index, the Russell 1000 Financials 40 Act 15/22.5 Daily Capped Index (USD). With an expense ratio of 0.39%, investors won&#8217;t have to worry about having to overpay: If you invest $10,000 in IYF, you would pay approximately $39 in fees per year. Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) Next up is the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD). Not only does this ETF deliver consistent income, but one of its core components is yet another Warren Buffett favorite: Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO). The iconic beverage giant commands a 4.3% slice of the SCHD ETF, and remarkably, represents a whopping 9.7% of Berkshire Hathaway&#8217;s total portfolio. Within the SCHD ETF, Coca-Cola is joined by fellow dividend stalwarts like Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ), Altria Group (NYSE: MO) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT). These companies have built reputations for consistently returning value to shareholders through robust dividends, making them almost a guaranteed fit for Buffett&#8217;s investing playbook. Their predictable cash flows and essential products underpin a long history of rewarding shareholders, a characteristic central to Buffett&#8217;s philosophy. While Buffett&#8217;s company, Berkshire Hathaway, isn&#8217;t a dividend-paying stock itself, that certainly doesn&#8217;t mean he discounts their power. Buffett has openly championed dividend-paying stocks as a shrewd strategy for investors on the hunt for steady income. Perhaps the most convincing evidence lies in Berkshire Hathaway&#8217;s top holding—Coca-Cola—a stock that diligently pays a dividend, which Buffett has no intentions of selling anytime soon. Its global brand power and consistent profitability make it a perpetual cash cow for Berkshire&#8217;s coffers. In early 2025, Coca-Cola announced its 63rd straight annual dividend hike, lifting its quarterly payout by 5.2% to $0.51 per share. Considering Buffett owns approximately 400 million shares of Coca-Cola stock, his company is effectively raking in over $800 million each year in dividend checks. Coca-Cola stock is also up 14.5% year-to-date, offering investors the added bonus of capital appreciation alongside their income. As for the broader Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF, it meticulously tracks the total return of the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index. With an incredibly modest expense ratio of just 0.060%, the SCHD ETF boasts over 100 holdings, granting shareholders a strong degree of diversification for protection. The fund’s underlying strategy prioritizes quality over quantity, avoiding risky high-yielding dividend stocks. Instead, it favors companies with long, proven track records of reliable payouts, offering investors a more reliable income stream and reduced volatility. This disciplined approach means even when the fund&#8217;s overall value experiences a dip, as it appears to have done in this wild 2025, investors still receive the benefit of earning consistent income through dividend distributions—which, Buffett seems to agree, is the ultimate icing on the cake for dividend stock investors anyway. Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) The Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) is a popular ETF known for its exposure to some high-flying technology stocks, including Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) and Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN). In fact, most of its top-10 holdings are technology stocks, with the exception of Costco Wholesale (Nasdaq: COST). While Warren Buffett isn&#8217;t known for his technology prowess, favoring instead businesses with more simple models, he has warmed up to the technology sector in recent years. Today, Apple and Amazon comprise 21.7% and 0.8% of Berkshire Hathaway&#8217;s portfolio, respectively. Apple is one of only a handful of Buffett&#8217;s technology stocks, which he began adding nearly a decade ago. The billionaire investor dove in head first with a $1 billion investment, making the iPhone maker one of the top holdings of Berkshire&#8217;s portfolio. Today Apple remains a key holding, with Berkshire&#8217;s investment worth over $64 billion. Buffett also bemoaned his hesitancy to add Amazon stock sooner than he did, kicking himself for for being &#8220;too dumb.&#8221; But he won&#8217;t make that mistake twice, and his AMZN holdings are now worth $2.2 billion in the Berkshire portfolio. Given their high-growth nature, the companies that make up the QQQ ETF are heavy capex spenders. While this strategy comes with an inherent amount of risk, which is the first group to be punished in challenging economic environments, the payoff can be equally as rewarding. And when it comes to capital appreciation, QQQ doesn&#8217;t disappoint. The QQQ ETF has delivered impressive long-term returns, outshining the S&amp;P 500 in seven out of the past 10 years. Investors who directed $10,000 invested in Invesco QQQ in 2020 would have seen their investment balloon to approximately $22,976 today. So far in 2025, QQQ posted a strong year-to-date gain of approximately 8%; at this pace, it will replicate last year&#8217;s returns of approximately 16%. Investors also receive a rather efficient expense ratio of just 0.20%, making it a cost-effective investment vehicle for access to Big Tech stocks, among other sector leaders. Investors with an appetite for risk and growth might find the QQQ appealing while also seizing the opportunity to hold a couple of Warren Buffett favorites.The post Here Are 3 ETFs Warren Buffett Would Approve Of for the Average Investor appeared first on 24/7 Wall St.."

Key Points The bank consolidations caused by the 2008 subprime mortgage banking meltdown wound up favoring large corporations for ongoing business at the expense of smaller ones. The Business Development Company sector has filled the debt financing gap for small and medium sized businesses abandoned by the large banks after 2008. Due to BDC registration requirements for capital markets access, shareholders receive 90% of BDC profits, often resulting in double digit annual yields. It’s hard to believe, but today there are credit cards offering up to 6% cash back, $200 statement credits, $0 annual fees, travel rewards, and more. See for yourself, I couldn’t believe it at first. Frankly, with rewards this good we don’t expect them to be available forever. But if you sign up today you can secure some of the best rewards we’ve ever seen. Click here to get started. Prior to 2008, some of the more popular US banking institutions included: Lehman Brothers Bear Stearns Wachovia Bank Washington Mutual Merrill-Lynch IndyMac As depicted in the 2015 movie, The Long Short, the unsustainable subprime mortgage bubble wound up causing a banking industry meltdown. All of the banks in the list above despite decades of successful operations, were caught flatfooted and insolvent when the crash hit. The federal government was forced to trigger TARP (Troubled Asset Relief Program) which helped to shore up the balance sheets of the largest institutions. The leftover banks were steered towards the TARP recipients for acquisition, with Bear Stearns most notably being acquired by JP Morgan Chase at a fire-sale price of $2 per share. Unsurprisingly, turning around operations to remove red ink from balance sheets became the imperative of all of these new consolidated banks. For example, Brian Moynihan of Bank of America, which acquired Merrill-Lynch, issued a directive for brokers to close out accounts smaller than $200,000. An unforeseen casualty of the bank consolidations were the small and medium sized businesses that had been relying on the Washington Mutuals, et al. for their revolving credit lines, their inventory finance, and a panoply of other debt finance services. With millions of medium and small businesses suddenly stuck without financing options, Business Development Companies (BDCs) emerged to fill the gap, which has subsequently created a sizable standalone BDC category estimated to be over $350 billion and part of the larger $1.8 trillion private credit sector. As BDCs are registered with the SEC, they are treated comparably to REITs and thus, shareholders receive 90% of BDC profits. The five BDC examples below give a good example of the demand strength in the sector and the boost to entrepreneurship and business creation and the yields each offers investors. WhiteHorse Finance, Inc. WhiteHorse Finance has provided over $2.78 billion worth of financings since 2012, with a partiality to software companies. WhiteHorse Finance, Inc. (NASDAQ: WHF) Yield: 17.66% WhiteHorse Finance, Inc. is a Business Development Company that finances lower and mid-tier companies with growth capital in the form of senior secured notes or first lien notes. Headquartered in Miami, FL, WhiteHorse typically originates its debt underwritings in the $25 million to $50 million range for US companies in the $50 million to $350 million enterprise value category. It has deployed its $642 million portfolio to finance $2.78 billion across 260 transactions since going public in 2012. Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc. Investment banking behemoth Goldman Sachs has a BDC industry presence under its own moniker. Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc.(NYSE: GSBD) Yield: 14.13% The lucrative profits that well financed firms can avail themselves of in the BDC space have caused some of the aforementioned larger banks to get a foothold into it as well, after abandoning it years ago. Goldman Sachs is one of them. MSNBC’s Jim Cramer described Goldman Sachs recently as a firm with “a thirst that can’t be slaked without more deals.” Journalist Matt Taibbi dubbed Goldman Sachs, the prestigious (some would say nefarious) investment bank with the nickname, “Great Vampire Squid” due to it being “wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money” and its omnipresent shadow on any financial platform where money can be made. The self-descriptive Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc. represents the Goldman Sachs BDC footprint. Stellus Capital Investment Corporation Orthotics producer Dr. Scholl&#8217;s is one of Stellus Capital Management&#8217;s 350+ financing clients. Stellus Capital Investment Corporation (NYSE: SCM) Yield: 11.47% Participating in both the private corporate debt and equity markets, Houston, TX headquartered Stellus Capital Investment Corp. finances deals for American and Canadian companies with EBITDA between $5 million and $50 million. With a $3.4 billion AUM warchest, Stellus has invested over $9.8 billion across 350+ investments since beginning over 20 years ago. The company currently has over 100 financings currently active. Carlyle Secured Lending, Inc. Carlyle Secured Lending is the BDC arm of Carlyle Group, best known for its financings in the aerospace and defense industries. Stock: Carlyle Secured Lending, Inc. (NASDAQ: CGBD) Yield: 12.93% Best known for its involvement with its aerospace and defense industry investments, NY based Carlyle Group has stakes in a number of other financial platforms. With a multi billion portfolio, Carlyle Secured Lending, Inc. is Carlyle Group’s entry into the BDC arena. Golub Capital BDC Inc. Small businesses and private credit financings that might be too small for most BDCs make up a sizable portion of Golub Capital&#8217;s clientele, and have helped it to earn its numerous awards. Golub Capital BDC Inc. (NASDAQ: GBDC) Yield: 10.65% Golub Capital BDC Inc. has an unbroken award winning decade-long streak in process, with its 2024 Lender of the Year win. In 2023, Golub Capital won all three Lender of the Year, Senior Lender of the Year, and BDC Manager of the Year in the Americas awards from Private Debt Investor (PDI), and has won 24 PDI awards since 2013. Its latest acknowledgement came this year from Newsweek, which listed Golub Capital BDC in its “America’s Greatest Midsize Workplaces” rankings.

The company also agreed to a 10-year deal with the DoD establishing the government as a long-term customer of MP's rare earths with a price floor of $110 per kilogram. The Trump administration has stated that becoming less dependent on other nations like China for rare earths—metals used in production of a variety of commercial and military products—is a top priority and national security concern. Shares of MP and USA Rare Earth (USAR) have been boosted this year by that commitment. MP Materials hit their highest price since April 2022 on Thursday morning, while USA Rare Earth shares were up nearly 14% shortly after markets opened.

Bank Stocks Continue Trending Down 12:06 pm by Eric Bleeker It&#8217;s now a little past noon, and there&#8217;s been no turnaround for either Wells Fargo or BlackRock. Wells Fargo is trading down about 5.5%, which is its daily low point. BlackRock has bounced back from its 11 a.m. lows, but is still down 5.7% on the day. Why is Wells Fargo Down? 11:09 am by Eric Bleeker Wells Fargo beat estimates but its shares are down about 5% in early trading. Let&#8217;s look at some reasons the stock is down despite this earnings beat: The company lowered expectations for its net interest income. Previously the company had guided to 1 to 3% growth in 2025, but now says it expects interest income to be &#8220;roughly in line&#8221; with 2024. The stock has also performed strongly in 2025. Shares were up more than 18% headed into today, so taking a breather isn&#8217;t unusual. We&#8217;ll continue monitoring what Wall Street has to say about Wells Fargo as the day progresses. BLK slid about 0.45% around 10:41 AM as volume spiked over 170% in that minute. 11:00 am by Eric Bleeker BlackRock just saw a significant volume spike at 10:41 a.m. ET. Its slide has accelerated since and the stock is now down 6.9% as of 11:01 a.m. ET. Major Outflow Weights on BlackRock Stock 10:32 am by Eric Bleeker Like Wells Fargo, BlackRock also reported solid earnings but is seeing its stock drop in early trading. One area that investors are watching is the company noting a $52 billion outflow from a major client. This led to a significant reduction in quarterly inflows (dropping the total down to $68 billion) and could be weighing on the stock this morning despite its solid EPS beat. Earnings season kicked off this morning with a group of powerful financial companies. Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC), and BlackRock (NYSE: BLK) each reported earnings before the bell. As of 10:00 a.m., both stocks were down. Wells Fargo: Down 4.5% BlackRock: Down 6.4% The morning has generally been unkind to stocks in the financial space. JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM) also reported earnings and is down about .6%. Citigroup (NYSE: C) is the lone bright spot in the financial space this morning, up 1.4%. We&#8217;ve compiled the main need-to-know information about each company&#8217;s earnings below and will be updating this live article with earnings analysis throughout the morning.

The results demonstrate the power of advice and supporting clients as the intermediary of capital across products and geographies, particularly during periods of uncertainty.&#8221; Strategic Updates: &#8211; The firm continues to invest in technology and automation to enhance operational efficiency and client service capabilities, while maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation amidst market volatility. Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) reports before the bell today. Large financial companies struggled yesterday. Stocks in the Financials sector declined 1.71%. Both Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) and BlackRock (NYSE: BLK) saw particularly steep declines after reporting earnings. Will Morgan Stanley plummet as well? We&#8217;ll be updating this live article with analysis after the company&#8217;s earnings drop. Let&#8217;s take a look at the need-to-know figures Wall Street is watching. Q2 Earnings Expectations Here are the key figures Wall Street is expecting when Morgan Stanley&#8217;s earnings release: Revenue: $16.02 billion EPS (Normalized): $1.98 Book Value/Share: $61.38 Net Income (GAAP): $3.14 Billion Key Areas to That Could Drive Today&#8217;s Performance What areas will determine whether Morgan Stanley&#8217;s stock rises or falls after today&#8217;s earnings release and conference call (scheduled for 8:30 a.m. ET). Wealth Management Margins: Last quarter normalized pre-tax margins for Wealth Management came in below their target (30 to 32%). With net interest income (NII) on the decline and exepnse pressures, any continued margin pressure in this unit could cause Morgan Stanley&#8217;s stock to sell off today. How Significant is NII Pressure: Wells Fargo shares fell yesterday on NII pressure and Morgan Stanley came in below many peers last quarter. If the company sees NII continue to trend down, it could be the primary area Wall Street focuses on today. Investment Banking Rebound: Investment banking was a bright spot in the first quarter. If Morgan Stanley speaks bullishly about its pipeline headed into the second half of the year and 2026, that could be a share price catalyst today.

NII Projected to $15.5B to $15.7B by Q4 7:25 am by Eric Bleeker This banking earnings season has been dominated by how banks are guiding net interest income, and Bank of America guided to $15.5B to $15.7B in Q4. That will likely be a number that analysts focus on in the company&#8217;s conference call which starts shortly. The Two Numbers to Watch 7:16 am by Eric Bleeker Bank of America just delivered $.89 in adjusted EPS versus estimates of $.86. Revenue came in at $26.5 billion, which is slightly below expectations of $26.73 billion in revenue. Shares are initially up 1.45% in premarket trading.

A Look Back at Bank of America&#039;s First Quarter 6:50 am by Eric Bleeker Before Bank of America reports its second-quarter earnings, let&#8217;s look back at how they fared in the prior quarter. Bank of America Q1&#8217;25 Earnings Highlights: • Adj. EPS: $0.90 ; UP +18% YoY • Revenue: $27.5B ; UP +6% YoY • Net Income: $7.4B ; UP +11% YoY • Return on Assets: 0.89%; UP +3 bps YoY • Return on Tangible Common Equity: 14%; UP +100 bps YoY • Deposits: Nearly $2 trillion; UP +8% from mid-2023 low Outlook: &#8211; Expectation for continued growth in net interest income (NII) driven by fixed-rate asset repricing and loan growth. &#8211; Anticipate stable deposit growth despite potential economic headwinds.

We saw good organic client activity, good growth in revenue and earnings, and we continue to invest in the future growth of our company.&#8221; CFO Commentary: &#8211; Alastair M. Borthwick: &#8220;We generated $7.4 billion in net income or $0.90 per diluted share this quarter, and that represents good growth over both last quarter and the year earlier period. Noninterest expense was $17.8 billion, up from the fourth quarter, driven by seasonally elevated payroll taxes and markets revenue-related costs of processing and incentives.&#8221; Strategic Updates: &#8211; Continued investment in commercial banking and wealth management to drive organic growth. &#8211; Focus on enhancing digital capabilities and customer engagement, with significant growth in digital interactions and sales. Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) is reporting earnings this morning and we&#8217;ll be updating this article with live analysis once results hit. Yesterday, companies like Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) and BlackRock (NYSE: BLK) reported earnings that broadly beat expectations, but still saw their shares fall. One reason for the drops: financial stocks have generally seen a strong 2025 year-to-date. Wells Fargo was up more than 18% headed into earnings, so poor interest income guidance was enough to sink the stock. Bank of America has lagged many of its peers, with &#8216;just&#8217; a 4% return year-to-date. So, the stock may be able to see stronger performance if its results top Wall Street expectations. What Wall Street Expects When Bank of America Reports Here are the key figures to watch when Bank of America reports shortly: Revenue: $26.73 billion EPS (Normalized): $.86 Net Income (GAAP): $6.51 billion Book Value/Share: $36.85 3 Key Areas to Watch in Bank of America&#8217;s Conference Call Bank of America is hosting its conference call at 8 a.m. ET. Here are some key areas Wall Street will be watching: Net Interest Income Pressure: Wells Fargo&#8217;s shares fell today on NII pressure. It&#8217;s likely that Wall Street will be zeroed in on how much lower short-term rates could impact Bank of America&#8217;s net interest in the second half of the year. Revenue Growth and Expense Management: With sluggish growth projected in 2025, Bank of America can continue to grow profitability by keeping expense management in check and growing operating leverage. Investment Banking Trends: Bank of America saw stronger investment banking business last quarter. Was the bounce temporary or the beginning of sustained growth in the division?

Here’s the Smartest Way to Turn It Into Monthly Passive Income","Inherited $400,000? Here’s the Smartest Way to Turn It Into Monthly Passive Income
Key Points The SPHD and DIVO ETFs are ideal vehicles for volatility mitigation and reliable income. Furthermore, you can enhance your monthly income potential with single-stock ETFs. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) If you&#8217;re fortunate enough to inherit $400,000, it may be tempting to spend that money on cars and vacations. However, the smart-money move is to invest the funds wisely and plan for your financial future. One approach is to invest that $400,000 in exchange traded funds (ETFs) that provide passive income every month. That way, you can reinvest the cash distributions and take advantage of the compounding effect. So now, it&#8217;s time to reveal four funds that unlock monthly income opportunities so you can turn your inheritance into a cash-producing machine. SPHD: A Reliable Pick for Low Volatility $400,000 is a whole lot of money to inherit and invest. Therefore, your first priority shouldn&#8217;t be maximizing your monthly dividends. Instead, it should be mitigating your risk so you don&#8217;t lose all of that money. When safety and reliability are your top priorities, the Invesco S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility ETF (NYSEARCA:SPHD) is a solid pick. This fund has 52 stocks in its holdings, all carefully selected from the S&amp;P 500 large-cap stock index. The SPHD ETF specifically chooses stocks &#8220;that historically have provided high dividend yields and low volatility.&#8221; Examples include Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), Realty Income Corp. (NYSE:O), Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), and Altria Group (NYSE:MO). These companies are known for providing consistent dividend payments, and their stocks typically aren&#8217;t volatile. Furthermore, the Invesco S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility ETF features a 12-month distribution rate (i.e., a forward annual dividend yield) of 3.44%. Plus, the SPHD ETF pays out its distributions on a monthly basis. With all of that in mind, you could take $150,000 of your inherited $400,000, put it into the Invesco S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility ETF, and sleep soundly at night. Stay in the Safe Lane With DIVO With $400,000 to invest, you&#8217;ll have a large account and there&#8217;s no need to drive in the fast lane. Instead, you can stay in the &#8220;safe lane&#8221; but still get a passive income stream with the Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF (NYSEARCA:DIVO). Much like the SPHD ETF, the Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF seeks to reduce share-price volatility while providing exposure to high-quality dividend-paying companies. Moreover, like the other funds mentioned today, DIVO puts cash distributions into your account on a monthly basis. The Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF has 24 stocks in its holdings, and you&#8217;ll see plenty of large-cap sector leaders in there. Among the top holdings in the DIVO ETF are Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), RTX/Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), Visa (NYSE:V), and Home Depot (NYSE:HD). Again, we&#8217;re choosing safety first and then aiming for good yield. Since the Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF invests in great companies and features an impressive 4.73% annual distribution rate, it checks all the right boxes. Thus, it would make sense to allocate $150,000 of a $400,000 inheritance toward the DIVO ETF. Accelerate Your Yield With Single-Stock ETFs It&#8217;s wise to dedicate $300,000 of your $400,000 inheritance toward diversified low-volatility funds like SPHD and DIVO. If you do that, then you can invest the remaining $100,000 in ETFs with greater risk but also higher yields. To that end, YieldMax offers a wide variety of ETFs that each focus on a single stock instead of a diversified basket of stocks. Typically, these YieldMax ETFs derive monthly income from U.S. Treasury bonds and sophisticated options-trading strategies. One way to reduce the risk is to stick to YieldMax ETFs that focus on established large-cap companies. For example, the YieldMax AAPL Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:APLY) indirectly derives income from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock. Currently, the APLY ETF advertises an annual distribution rate of 26.99%. This fund shouldn&#8217;t be excessively risky as Apple is a reliable blue-chip business with staying power. So, you could invest $25,000 of your $400,000 inheritance in the YieldMax AAPL Option Income Strategy ETF. A reasonable plan would be to pick four single-stock ETFs with a focus on high-confidence companies. Then, you could allocate $25,000 toward each of the four funds you picked. A Mixed-Risk Approach APLY is just one example of many monthly-paying single-stock ETFs you can choose from. Here&#8217;s a summary of other funds in this category, and while you explore them, you might think about picking your four favorites: The YieldMax AMZN Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:AMZY); based on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock; 47.82% annual distribution rate The YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:NVDY); based on NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock; 74.99% annual distribution rate The YieldMax GOOGL Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:GOOY); based on the stock of Google parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL); 32.9% annual distribution rate The YieldMax MSFT Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:MSFO); based on Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock; 34.9% annual distribution rate The YieldMax JPM Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:JPMO); based on JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) stock; 39% annual distribution rate The YieldMax AMD Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:AMDY); based on Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock; 68.07% annual distribution rate The YieldMax DIS Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:DISO); based on Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) stock; 38.55% annual distribution rate The YieldMax XOM Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:XOMO); based on Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) stock; 38.04% annual distribution rate Just to provide an idea of what your overall plan might look like, you could invest $150,000 in SPHD, $150,000 in DIVO, and $25,000 each in APLY, MSFO, DISO, and XOMO. All in all, you can mix low-risk ETFs with a handful of higher-risk ETFs to turn your inherited $400,000 into a fairly reliable monthly income-producing machine.The post Inherited $400,000?

With inflation sticky and rate cuts unlikely in 2024, investors should consider repositioning into high-yield stocks to offset volatility.

Key Points The RSPA ETF will immediately turn the bulk of your $25,000 account into a diversified income machine. Smaller allocations into SCHD, JEPQ, and FDVV will help you build a low-fee passive income foundation. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) How far can $25,000 get you? If you have a well-considered plan in place, you can actually turn your small account into a passive income factory. This can be done with a carefully selected group of high-yield, low-fee exchange traded funds (ETFs). With just $25,000, you can build a super-low-cost portfolio that consistently pays you cash dividends/distributions. Plus, you can de-risk your portfolio through multi-sector diversification and investment in famous large-cap companies. So, let&#8217;s start right now with a smart-money plan to extract sizable cash payouts from a small but growing account. Start With RSPA for Extra Diversification Out of a $25,000 account, you can confidently put $10,000 into just one ETF. That&#8217;s because the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF (NYSEARCA:RSPA) checks all of the right boxes for a small-sized high-growth portfolio. To populate a small-sized portfolio, I would want to use funds that invest in successful, blue-chip business. I would also insist that the ETFs should be diversified and need to have annual operating expenses below 0.5%. With a focus on companies in the prestigious S&amp;P 500 index, the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF has 525 stocks in its holdings. Suffice it to say, then, that the RSPA ETF is widely diversified. When you examine the fund&#8217;s holdings list, you&#8217;ll find established large-cap leaders across multiple economic sectors. Some examples are Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), and Consolidated Edison (NYSE:ED). An interesting feature of the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF is that each of the holdings has a small, roughly equal weighing to the other stocks in the fund. That way, you won&#8217;t over-invest in any single stock. In addition, the RSPA ETF is low-cost as it only deducts annualized operating fees of 0.29%. And for all of you yield hunters out there, the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF currently features a 12-month distribution rate of 9.42%. All in all, this ultra-diversified fund is ideal for a $25,000 account and I would feel comfortable dedicating $10,000 toward RSPA. Expand Your Portfolio With SCHD and JEPQ Even though the RSPA ETF would already expose you to 500+ stocks, you still probably wouldn&#8217;t want to toss your entire $25,000 into just one fund. Consequently, we will now explore three more ETFs and, after conducting your own due diligence, you could invest $5,000 in each one of them. The first of these three intriguing funds is the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHD). This ETF tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index and has a portfolio comprising 103 stocks. Again, we&#8217;re looking for famous large-cap names and multi-sector diversification. The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF meets these expectations with recognizable stocks like Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Merck (NYSE:MRK), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and Chevron (NYSE:CVX). Moreover, the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF serves up a trailing 12-month distribution yield of 3.87% but only deducts 0.06% worth of annual operating expenses. Therefore, investors should have no objections to allocating $5,000 toward the SCHD ETF. Next up is the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:JEPQ), which is centered around the technology-focused NASDAQ 100 index. This fund includes 107 stocks so you can participate in the growth of tech&#8217;s heavy hitters, such as NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Committing $5,000 of your $25,000 portfolio to the JEPQ ETF will unlock extra share-price appreciation potential from a variety of top tech firms. You&#8217;ll also get access to substantial cash distributions as the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF features an impressive 11.52% annual yield. We&#8217;re still sticking to the low-cost theme here since JEPQ only deducts operating fees of 0.35% per year. So, why not add some technology-fueled firepower to your small portfolio with the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF? Round It Out With FDVV To round out your $25,000 passive-income plan, you could assign $5,000 toward the Fidelity High Dividend ETF (NYSEARCA:FDVV). Instead of concentrating on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&amp;P 500, or NASDAQ 100, the FVDD ETF corresponds to the Fidelity High Dividend Index. Among the holdings list of the Fidelity High Dividend ETF, you&#8217;ll find large-cap superstars like Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), Visa (NYSE:V), Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG), and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). Overall, you&#8217;ll get exposure to plenty of consistent dividend deliverers with FDVV. The other need-to-know stats are that the Fidelity High Dividend ETF offers a trailing 12-month distribution yield of 3.07% but only deducts 0.16% in annualized operating expenses. With all of those benefits in mind, you can proudly add $5,000 worth of FDVV shares to your $25,000 account. Now, you&#8217;ve got a four-pack of funds with RSPA as your anchor as well as SCHD, JEPQ, and FDVV for extra diversification. That&#8217;s a savvy plan to keep the fees to a minimum while turning your $25,000 account into a low-risk regular income producer.The post How to Build a Super Low Cost Passive Income Fund for Only $25,000 appeared first on 24/7 Wall St.."

Shares of Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) gained 2.33% over the past month, bringing its year-to-date gain to 15.02%. Since hitting its 2025 low on April 4, the stock is up nearly 40%. When the company reported Q2 earnings earlier in July, it announced mixed results with EPS of 89 cents versus analysts&#8217; expectations of 86 cents, and revenues of $26.61 billion versus expectations of $26.72 billion. It was the only major U.S. bank to fall short on revenue for the quarter. Since its Depression-era roots in San Francisco, Bank of America has weathered close to a century of wars and financial upheavals to rise as one of the top financial institutions in the US, ranking #2 behind JP Morgan Chase by asset size. Bank of America’s massive AUM heft made it a $45 billion “too big to fail” TARP bailout recipient during the 2008 subprime banking meltdown. It also acquired Wall Street investment banking stalwart Merrill-Lynch as a kicker. CEO Brian Moynihan has ruthlessly slashed operations to focus on growing assets under management with lower overhead. 24/7 Wall St. has analyzed the stock, industry, sector and the macro environment to forecast where shares of Bank of America could be heading over the next five years. Bank of American (BAC) Recent Stock Success After reaching its five-year high of $49.18 per share in January 2022, Bank of America has struggled to attain that level again. Efforts to climb higher had been thwarted, but after bottoming in late October 2023, the stock has rallied back gaining nearly 84% by the end of January 2025. Regardless, investors are much more concerned with future stock&#8217;s performance over the next one, five and 10 years. While most Wall Street analysts will calculate 12-month forward projections, it’s clear that nobody has a consistent crystal ball, and plenty of unforeseen circumstances can render even near-term projections irrelevant. 24/7 Wall St. aims to present some farther-looking insights based on Bank of America’s own numbers, along with business and market development information that may be of help to our readers’ own research. Year Price Revenues Net Income 2015 $13.99 $79.804B $15.910B 2016 $18.67 $80.104B $17.822B 2017 $25.50 $83.730B $18.232B 2018 $21.53 $87.738B $28.147B 2019 $31.47 $85.582B $27.430B 2020 $27.81 $74.208B $17.894B 2021 $41.61 $93.707B $31.978B 2022 $31.70 $92.407B $27.528B 2023 $33.23 $94.187B $26.515B LTM $40.75 $93.156B $24.517B Key Drivers for Bank of America’s Stock in the Future 1. Interest Sensitive Balance Sheet: The Federal Reserve&#8217;s Fed Funds rate hikes have boosted BAC&#8217;s net interest income (NII), but negatively impacted the stock price. Rate cuts might temporarily help lending and mortgage finance, but any renewed inflation signs will be red flags and could trigger further problems. 2. Net Interest Income: The rise in NII due to higher interest rates and corresponding robust loan interest rate growth has been a critical factor for that segment, but at the cost of higher default rates and lower transaction volumes. 3. Branch Growth: Expanding financial centers and branches into currently untapped demographic markets is a part of Bank of America’s “local” growth strategy. Its Branch Expansion agenda aims to have a presence in every state. The physical presence results in a 100% increase in digital sales, and looks to expand its 3,800 branches. 4. Technology: Improved digital offerings and the use of AI and other customer service tools, can boost customer satisfaction and fees that could boost earnings. 5. Capital Deployment Strategies: Bank of America&#8217;s dividend increases and share repurchase plans reflect a strong capital position, attractive to dividend hawk-oriented investors. Bank of America (BAC) Stock Prediction for 2025 The current Wall Street consensus, median one-year price target for Bank of America is $52.24, which represents 8.96% potential upside from today’s share price. BAC receives a consensus &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; rating from the 19 analysts covering the stock, with 16 assigning it as a &#8220;Buy,&#8221; three assigning it as a &#8220;Hold&#8221; and none assigning it as a &#8220;Sell.&#8221; 24/7 Wall St.&#8216;s 12-month forecast for Bank of America is more conservative. We see BAC ending 2025 at a price of $47.20, or 1.54% lower than today&#8217;s share price. Bank of America (BAC) Stock Forecast 2025–2030 By 2030, the Branch Expansion program should have met its targeted location goals, and all of them would be primed for using the latest and most sophisticated Bank of America digital financial tools. Bank of America Erica(c) digital assistant, Zelle, Venmo, proprietary digital payment systems, online brokerage and other virtual platforms would be fully implemented and income generating. 24/7 Wall St.’s price target for 2030 is $63.96 per share, representing a potential gain of 33.41% from the current share price.
