    "text": "Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Roku (ROKU) +2.13% 4:45 pm Roku executed cleanly, but the modest stock move reflects already high expectations. Free cash flow, platform margin expansion, and a solid Q3 guide reaffirm the recovery story. The question now is whether Roku can re-accelerate engagement and ad yield fast enough to justify further multiple expansion. More Takeaways 4:43 pm Platform Margins Rebound: Platform gross profit rose 20% YoY, while platform gross margin rebounded to 54.5% (up from 51.8% last quarter). This reflects improving ad pricing and better optimization of first-party demand. Free Cash Flow Turns Positive Again: Roku reported $26.5 million in free cash flow, swinging back into the black after a few quarters of cash burn. Operating leverage from better gross margins and tight expense control helped drive the shift. Active Accounts &amp; Engagement Trends 4:35 pm Active Accounts: 84.8 million (up 1.7M QoQ, up 12% YoY) Streaming Hours: 31.7 billion (flat QoQ, up 20% YoY) Roku added more accounts than expected, but total streaming hours plateaued sequentially — a key area to watch as engagement fuels ad inventory monetization. Guidance Update 4:23 pm Roku provided the following Q3 2025 outlook: Revenue: ~$940 million Adj. EBITDA: $(20) million Gross Profit: ~$430 million This represents a ~7.6% sequential growth in topline revenue, while narrowing EBITDA losses significantly. Gross margin guidance implies modest operating leverage ahead. CEO Anthony Wood emphasized that advertising spend is stabilizing, and Roku continues to gain share of traditional TV budgets. The tone was cautiously optimistic, especially on the AI-powered ad tools improving campaign efficiency and targeting. “We are seeing healthy engagement and strong monetization as marketers adapt to converged TV,” said Wood. CFO Dan Jedda added that “Disciplined expense management” remains a top priority amid evolving macro conditions. Roku Earnings Out, Stock Up 4:11 pm Roku share are up 3% immediately after releasing earnings. Metric Reported Consensus Estimate Beat/Miss Revenue $1.118B $1.072B Beat Adjusted EPS –$0.07 –$0.16 Beat Free Cash Flow $161.7M $57.7M Beat Gross Profit $500M N/A — Gross Margin 44.7% 43.5% (est. Q1) Beat What&#039;s Wall Street saying about Roku? 3:33 pm by Eric Bleeker We&#8217;re now just 30 minutes away from earnings. One question before earnings is what Wall Street has been saying about Roku recently.

    "text": "Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Conference Call Is Over 6:10 pm Apple&#8217;s conference call has ended and shares are up 3%. Overall, the company did a lot tonight to push the narrative they&#8217;ll be aggressive to catch up in AI and that device sales are rebounding. It&#8217;s a good quarter for Apple that might start turning around what&#8217;s been a disappointing 2025. Tim Cook on AI 5:58 pm TD Cowen Analst: Tim, I was curious about your thoughts on AI for edge devices. There&#8217;s like some people who think that LLM could be a commodity in the future. Do you think &#8212; do you see a scenario where the LLM become a third part of your iOS or is the SLM the way to go and how to think about evolution of edge devices in a futuristic AI world and is smartphone going to be the choice of device. Just curious your thoughts on it, broadly speaking. Timothy Cook Chief Executive Officer The way that we look at AI is that it&#8217;s 1 of the most profound technologies of our lifetime. And I think it will affect all devices in a significant way what pieces of the chain are commoditized and not commoditized, I wouldn&#8217;t want to to really talk about today. because that gives away some things on our strategy. But I think it&#8217;s a good question. . Tim Cook on Apple Momentum 5:48 pm Here&#8217;s what Tim Cook had to say about Apple&#8217;s surprising momentum in China last quarter: &#8220;Yes. We did grow in Greater China by 4% during the quarter versus the previous quarter, it was driven by an acceleration by iPhone, although we also had substantial growth on the MAC year-over-year. From a &#8212; as you know, the government has placed certain subsidies that affects some of our products, not all of them, but there are some of them. And I think that had some effect. It was the first full quarter of the subsidy playing out. that cut in during a portion of the previous quarter. The other things I would say are that the installed base hit a record high in Greater China &#8212; and we set an all-time record for the iPhone installed base. The iPhone upgraders in Mainland China set a record for the June quarter. And according to Boral Panel, which was formerly known as Kantar, iPhone had the top 3 models in Urban China, which is extraordinary. Also, if you look at the other products, Mac, iPad and watch, the majority of customers that are buying in China Mainland were new to the product. So lots of good things there. And the other thing I would point out, which is an interesting point, The MacBook Air was the top-selling laptop model in all of China, and the Mac Mini was the top-selling desktop model in all of China. So overall, a positive &#8212; very positive quarter.&#8221; Apple&#039;s CFO Says AI Investments Will Rise 5:47 pm &#8220;I would say, a pretty significant driver as Tim talked about, is the fact we are increasing our investment significantly in AI. So that is certainly a component of it. As you know, we&#8217;ve been investing in private cloud compute, which is also in our first-party data centers. The other piece, as you know, is we do have a hybrid strategy where in cases we do use third parties to make capital investments, and we also invest in our own. So you are going to see an increase in CapEx. We also, from time to time, have other investments in facilities in tooling, but I would say a significant portion of the driver of growth that you&#8217;re seeing now is really driven by some of our AI-related investments.&#8221; &#8211; Kevan Parekh, Apple CFO Tariff Implications 5:22 pm On Apple&#8217;s conference call they just said they incurred $800 million in tariff-related costs last quarter.

    "text": "Shares of Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) gained 3.95% over the past five trading sessions after reporting Q2 earnings on July 31, bringing the e-commerce and cloud storage solutions stock&#8217;s year-to-date gain into the green with a gain of 0.67%. Over the past year, it is up 32.91%. On July 8, it was reported that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos sold nearly three million shares worth $665.8 million over two days in July as part of a plan announced earlier in 2025 that will see Bezos unload up to 25 million shares through May 2026. In its most recent earnings call, the company reported that net sales increased 13% to $167.7 billion in the second quarter, compared with $148.0 billion in the year-prior quarter. Net income increased to $18.2 billion, or $1.68 per diluted share, compared with $13.5 billion, or $1.26 per diluted share, in Q2 2024. However, free cash flow decreased to $18.2 billion TTM, compared with $53.0 billion TTM the year prior due to Amazon&#8217;s ongoing CapEx on AI. In June and July the stock saw a series of adjusted price targets. Analysts at Stifel ($262 from $245), Barclays ($275 from $240), Bank of America ($272 from $265), Piper Sandler ($255 from $250), Capital ($270 from $233), Citi ($265 from $225), Needham ($265 from $220), Cantor Fitzgerald ($260 from $240), Truist ($250 from $226), all recently upgraded their price targets for AMZN. Amazon announced in July that it has deployed its 1 millionth robot while also deploying its new AI foundation model to power its robotic fleet. Its first twelfth generation automated fulfillment center launched in late-2024 and the robots are primarily focused on delivery station efficiencies. The robotics cycle is &#8220;early,&#8221; according to Bank of America&#8217;s analyst, who expects Amazon to leverage robots to reduce labor dependency, increase order accuracy and improve warehouse efficiency, driving material cost savings. While there can be little doubt about Amazon&#8217;s current financial health, investors and potential investors may be right to wonder whether growth can continue at Amazon&#8217;s historic pace, and whether the stock is safe as a long-term holding. Let&#8217;s take a look at where the share price could be headed. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: Amazon is facing substantial headwinds this year, but the stock remains fundamentally sound with a &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; rating. AWS, AI and ad sales continue to be major drivers for the Magnificent Seven stock. If you’re looking for a megatrend with massive potential, make sure to grab a complimentary copy of our “The Next NVIDIA” report. This report breaks down AI stocks with 10x potential and will give you a huge leg up on profiting from this massive sea change. Why Invest in Amazon? In the past 20 years, Amazon&#8217;s stock is up more than 9,491%. The company has been called one of the most influential economic and cultural forces in the world, and its brand is one of the world&#8217;s most valuable. Though the stock tumbled as the COVID-19 pandemic waned and lockdowns ended (along with the broader markets), it has more than recovered. Shares of this Magnificent Seven member hit an all-time high on Feb. 4, 2025, but with the Nasdaq briefly entering bear market territory in March, it had been downhill for Amazon in 2025. There have been signs of hope recently, with AMZN rebounding along with the broad market. It is hard to imagine that the company or its share price will collapse any time soon, but analysts and investors may see the stock as overbought. Let&#8217;s see what Wall Street expects. Amazon as a Company The company engages in the retail sale of consumer products, advertising, and subscriptions service through online and physical stores internationally. It also manufactures and sells electronic devices and develops and produces media content. Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides compute, storage, database, analytics, machine learning, and other services. And Amazon Prime is the company&#8217;s membership program. Amazon is based in Seattle. It was founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos, the former chief executive officer and now executive board chair. Amazon went public in May 1997. Its retail competitors include Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE:BABA), Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT). It also competes with the likes of Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT). The company continues its push into artificial intelligence with an update of its Alexa feature to Alexa+. AWS investments in cloud computing and AI also continue, with the former being the world&#8217;s largest cloud services provider and the latter nearing its debut of its &#8220;Nova&#8221; chatbot, which will compete in price with ChatGPT. Additionally, Amazon has been expanding its same-day delivery services, and its entertainment division has secured the James Bond franchise with the acquisition of MGM Studios. Headwinds include ongoing labor issues. The most recent quarterly results showed strong performance, with AWS as a major growth driver. Amazon as a Stock Wall Street analysts&#8217; median price target of $264.21 is above Amazon&#8217;s all-time high share price seen earlier this year and good for potential upside of 19.17%. Of the 44 analysts covering AMZN, all but one assign it a &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating, with the other assigning it a &#8220;Hold&#8221; rating. Overall, the stock receives a consensus &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; rating. With 63.76% of shares held by institutional investors — including notable stakes from the three largest asset management companies, Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street — the stock is popular among Wall Street&#8217;s sell-side firms. Institutional holdings of Amazon have seen net increase with 3,073 position increases versus 2,270 position decreases. Wall Street expectations for where the stock goes in the next 52 weeks vary. While analysts overall anticipate healthy upside, the lowest price target indicates a decline in the share price. The consensus projection signals strong upside potential for the next 52 weeks, based on strong forward guidance for business segments like AWS and Prime Video&#8217;s ad sales, which saw enormous year-over-year increases as the platform now hosts the NFL&#8217;s Thursday Night Football programming. Estimate Price Target %Change From Current Price Low $235 5.99% Median $264.21 19.17% High $300.00 35.31% Amazon does face some headwinds and risks in addition to those mentioned above. Consumer spending has rebounded in the wake of Trump&#8217;s tariff threats and subsequent pauses, which could help GDP in Q2 after it contracted GDP in Q1, raising the risks of a possible recession in 2025. Over the past three months, the consumer discretionary sector of the S&amp;P 500 — into which Amazon falls — has performed the fourth best, posting a gain of 8.94%. While the company dominates in the retail space and is a tech leader, competition in neither category is likely to go away anytime soon. All these things could have a huge impact on profitability. Despite some skeptics, the prospects for Amazon are optimistic overall, especially in the short term. Wall Street&#8217;s &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; consensus rating and the upside potential far outweigh the downside potential shares of AMZN face.
