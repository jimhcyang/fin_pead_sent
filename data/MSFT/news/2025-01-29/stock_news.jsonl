Al asociarse con Microsoft y aprovechar su Semantic Kernel, Omada ha creado asistentes de Inteligencia Artificial (en adelante IA) centrados en la seguridad de las identidades que impulsan la automatización, mejoran la toma de decisiones y ofrecen experiencias de usuario altamente personalizadas y contextuales. El asistente de IA se ha basado en Microsoft Semantic Kernel, un potente marco de desarrollo de código abierto que permite a las empresas integrar capacidades de IA en las aplicaciones. Diseñado para ofrecer flexibilidad y escalabilidad entre los modelos avanzados de IA y los procesos de negocio, con el fin de proporcionar un rápido despliegue de soluciones inteligentes adaptadas a las necesidades específicas de cada organización. La combinación de portabilidad y extensibilidad que ofrecen los plugins convierte a Semantic Kernel en una herramienta robusta y versátil para desarrollar soluciones avanzadas de IA. Tanto si se trata de mejorar aplicaciones de Microsoft 365 como de crear copilotos personalizados, estas funciones garantizan que la IA pueda integrarse a la perfección en diversos flujos de trabajo y plataformas, proporcionando una solución potente y flexible para las empresas modernas. Para los usuarios ocasionales de los sistemas IGA, interactuar esporádicamente con estas herramientas puede ser una experiencia confusa y no siempre sencilla, que a menudo conduce a la ineficacia y a la aparición de prácticas de shadow IT. Para los usuarios frecuentes, aunque la experiencia resulte más familiar en ocasiones puede ser igualmente difícil, ya que requiere información clara y contextual sobre los solicitantes y sus necesidades. La nueva integración basada en IA aborda ambos escenarios permitiendo flujos de trabajo intuitivos y conversacionales a través de Microsoft Teams. Este enfoque reduce drásticamente la complejidad, acelera la realización de tareas y minimiza los errores humanos. La perfecta integración de Omada Identity Cloud con las capacidades de IA de Microsoft crea una experiencia más inteligente, rápida y fácil de usar. Donde los usuarios ocasionales disponen ahora de asistencia guiada para ser autosuficientes en estos entornos menos habituales. Y los usuarios frecuentes se benefician de una visión contextualizada de los solicitantes, lo que permite la toma de decisiones y un procesamiento más rápido de las solicitudes. La integración de Omada Identity Cloud con Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service y Semantic Kernel a través de Teams, transformando la experiencia del usuario para aprovechar un canal conocido y habitual del mismo, en un proceso intuitivo y conversacional para mejorar la eficacia. El resultado es una mejora de la productividad, menos cuellos de botella operativos y una reducción significativa de las solicitudes de soporte de TI. Esta integración proporciona a las organizaciones poder para: Michael Garrett, Director Ejecutivo de Omada, explicó: \"Esta innovadora asociación tecnológica con Microsoft transforma el Gobierno de la Identidad en una experiencia fluida impulsada por la IA y adaptada al lugar de trabajo moderno. De cara al futuro, estas interfaces basadas en IA pueden evolucionar hasta convertirse en sistemas altamente adaptables que ayuden en las tareas inmediatas y proporcionen una ligera formación en seguridad durante las interacciones, reforzando la comprensión del usuario de los procesos críticos de seguridad de la identidad. Esto garantiza que incluso los usuarios ocasionales puedan seguir siendo eficaces, seguros y cumpliendo con los requisitos normátivos\". Julie Mørch Nadelmann, director mundial de soluciones de socios de Microsoft Denmark, afirmó: \"Esta integración transformadora con Omada pone de relieve nuestro compromiso compartido con la innovación, proporcionando a las organizaciones las herramientas que necesitan para mantenerse eficaces, conformes y seguras. Juntos, estamos ofreciendo una experiencia fluida basada en IA y adaptada al lugar de trabajo moderno, con asistentes de IA centrados en la seguridad de la identidad que impulsan la automatización, mejoran la toma de decisiones y ofrecen experiencias de usuario personalizadas y contextuales\". Acerca de Omada Omada, líder del mercado mundial en Gobierno de Identidades y Accesos (IGA), ofrece una solución IGA nativa de la nube, de nivel empresarial y completa que permite a las organizaciones lograr el cumplimiento, reducir el riesgo y maximizar la eficiencia.

En s'associant à Microsoft et en utilisant un noyau sémantique, Omada a créé des assistants IA axés sur la sécurité des identités qui favorisent l'automatisation, améliorent la prise de décision et offrent des expériences utilisateur hautement personnalisées et contextuelles. Le développement a été planifié à l'aide du noyau sémantique de Microsoft, un puissant cadre de développement source ouverte qui permet aux entreprises d'intégrer des capacités d'IA de pointe dans leurs applications de manière transparente. Conçu pour être flexible et évolutive, il fait le lien entre les modèles d'IA avancés et les processus commerciaux du monde réel, ce qui permet de déployer rapidement des solutions intelligentes adaptées aux besoins spécifiques de l'organisation. La combinaison de la portabilité et de l'extensibilité offerte par les plugins fait du noyau sémantique un outil robuste et polyvalent pour le développement de solutions d'IA avancées. Qu'il s'agisse d'améliorer les applications Microsoft 365 ou de créer des copilotes personnalisés, ces fonctionnalités garantissent que l'IA peut être intégrée de manière transparente dans divers flux de travail et plateformes, offrant ainsi une solution puissante et flexible aux entreprises modernes. Pour les utilisateurs occasionnels des systèmes d'IGA, l'interaction avec les logiciels de sécurité peut être une expérience sporadique et déroutante, conduisant souvent à des inefficacités et, dans certains cas, à l'émergence de pratiques « informatiques fantômes ». Pour les utilisateurs quotidiens, la gestion d'un grand nombre de demandes d'accès peut s'avérer tout aussi difficile, car elle nécessite des informations claires et contextuelles sur les demandeurs et leurs besoins. La nouvelle intégration pilotée par l'IA répond à ces deux scénarios en permettant des flux de travail intuitifs et conversationnels par l'intermédiaire de Microsoft Teams. Cette approche réduit considérablement la complexité, accélère l'exécution des tâches et minimise les erreurs humaines. L'intégration transparente d'Omada Identity Cloud avec les capacités d'IA de Microsoft crée une expérience plus intelligente, plus rapide et plus conviviale. Les utilisateurs occasionnels disposent désormais d'une assistance guidée pour naviguer dans des interactions complexes et peu fréquentes. De leur côté, les utilisateurs fréquents bénéficient d'une vue contextualisée des demandeurs, ce qui leur permet de prendre des décisions plus éclairées et de traiter les demandes plus rapidement. L'intégration d'Omada Identity Cloud avec Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service et le noyau sémantique par l'intermédiaire de Teams transforme l'expérience utilisateur en un processus intuitif et conversationnel, aidant les utilisateurs à naviguer plus efficacement dans leurs tâches. Il en résulte une amélioration de la productivité, une diminution des goulets d'étranglement opérationnels et une réduction significative des demandes d'assistance informatique ; désormais, les utilisateurs peuvent compter sur l'assistant IA activé par Teams pour les guider dans leurs tâches et les aider à devenir plus intuitifs, plus réactifs et plus centrés sur l'utilisateur. Cette intégration permet aux organisations de : Michael Garrett, PDG d'Omada, a déclaré : « Ce partenariat technologique innovant avec Microsoft transforme la gouvernance des identités en une expérience transparente pilotée par l'IA et adaptée au lieu de travail moderne. À l'avenir, ces interfaces pilotées par l'IA peuvent évoluer vers des systèmes hautement adaptatifs qui aident à accomplir des tâches immédiates et fournissent une formation légère en matière de sécurité pendant les interactions, renforçant ainsi la compréhension par l'utilisateur des processus essentiels en matière de sécurité de l'identité. Ainsi, même les utilisateurs occasionnels peuvent rester efficaces, conformes et sûrs ». Julie Mørch Nadelmann, responsable mondial des solutions, Microsoft Danemark, a ajouté : « Cette intégration transformatrice avec Omada souligne notre engagement commun en faveur de l'innovation, en fournissant aux organisations les outils dont elles ont besoin pour rester efficaces, conformes et sécurisées. Ensemble, nous offrons une expérience transparente axée sur l'IA et adaptée au lieu de travail moderne, avec des assistants IA axés sur la sécurité de l'identité qui favorisent l'automatisation, améliorent la prise de décision et offrent des expériences utilisateur personnalisées et contextuelles. » À propos d'Omada Omada, leader mondial du marché de l'administration et de la gouvernance des identités (IGA), propose unesolution IGA cloud native complète et de qualité professionnelle, qui permet aux entreprises de se conformer aux normes, de réduire les risques et de maximiser l'efficacité.

By partnering with Microsoft and leveraging Semantic Kernel, Omada has created AI assistants focused on identity security that drive automation, enhance decision-making and deliver highly personalized and contextual user experiences. The development has been planned with the use of Microsoft Semantic Kernel, a powerful, open-source development framework that empowers businesses to integrate cutting-edge AI capabilities into applications seamlessly. Designed for flexibility and scalability, it bridges advanced AI models and real-world business processes, enabling rapid deployment of intelligent solutions tailored to specific organizational needs.

For daily users, managing large volumes of access requests can be equally challenging, requiring clear, contextual information on requesters and their needs. The new AI-driven integration addresses both scenarios by enabling intuitive, conversational workflows through Microsoft Teams. This approach drastically reduces complexity, accelerates task completion, and minimizes human errors. Omada Identity Cloud's seamless integration with Microsoft's AI capabilities creates a smarter, faster, and more user-friendly experience. Occasional users now have guided assistance in navigating infrequent, complex interactions. Meanwhile, frequent users benefit from a contextualized view of requesters, enabling more informed decisions and faster request processing. Integrating Omada Identity Cloud with Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service and Semantic Kernel through Teams transforms the user experience into an intuitive, conversational process, helping users navigate tasks more effectively. The result is improved productivity, fewer operational bottlenecks, and a significant reduction in IT support requests; now, users can rely on the Teams-powered AI assistant to guide them through their tasks and help them become more intuitive, responsive and user-centric. This integration gives organizations the power to: Michael Garrett, CEO, Omada, said: \"This innovative technology partnership with Microsoft transforms identity governance into a seamless AI-driven experience tailored to the modern workplace. Looking ahead, such AI-driven interfaces can evolve into highly adaptive systems that assist with immediate tasks and provide light security training during interactions, reinforcing the user's understanding of critical identity security processes.

Gates stated, “I'm among the people who think the deficit needs to be brought down because otherwise it will create a financial problem for us.” Despite his support, Gates expressed concern over the complete elimination of certain programs under the new entity. He underscored the significance of long-term beneficial programs like HIV treatment initiatives. Gates warned, “If you cut those off, not only would they die when we have a cure on its way, but the negative feelings you'd have say, in Africa, would be worse than never having done the thing at all.” The interview also saw Gates discussing his childhood, U.S.-China relations, and his ties with Jeffrey Epstein.
