    "text": "Everyone knows Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and its best-known products, including the Windows operating system and Microsoft 365 suite of productivity apps, but its growing cloud computing platform, Azure, is the future of the company. Microsoft stock has been a millionaire maker for decades, with a stock split-adjusted IPO price of $0.14, which means at today’s stock price of $417.98, the stock is up 429473.69%. That would have turned a $1000 investment at Microsoft’s IPO into $4.30 million today. As one of the most valuable companies in the world, the only thing investors focus on is what the stock will do over the coming years. Wall Street analysts only go as far as 1 year out when giving a stock prediction. But long-term investors want to know where Microsoft might be several years down the road. 24/7 Wall Street aims to give you our assumptions on the stock and provide our insights around the numbers coming from Microsoft and which markets the company is operating in that are most exciting to us. Key Points in this Article: Key growth drivers: Azure cloud services, productivity software, and LinkedIn dominate Microsoft’s future potential. Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision boosts its gaming segment, enhancing its competitive edge in the personal computing market.

It has a software stock that could ride dominance in AI to returns of 10X or more. Recent Microsoft Stock Updates and News 11/12/2024 Despite a broader market downturn today, Microsoft rose 1.20% to $423.03. 11/11/2024 Isabell Sheang has rejoined Microsoft as a group product marketing and go-to product manager. In her new role, Sheang will lead a team focused on global strategies for Windows Commercial. Sheang previously worked for Microsoft from 2008 to 2016, in addition to working at VMWare and as an adjunct professor at the University of Washington. 11/8/2024 Microsoft is testing out a greener approach to data center construction with Cross-Laminated Timber (CLT). CLT is a fire-resistant wood material that can greatly lower carbon emissions compared to traditional materials like steel and concrete. By using CLT, Microsoft aims to cut carbon emissions by 35% and reduce greenhouse emissions by 65%. 11/7/2024 Released three years ago, Windows II now accounts for 35.55% of the market. This surge in popularity comes as Microsoft prepares to end support for Windows 10, charging a fee for extended service. 11/6/2024 Microsoft is expanding the capabilities of Windows on Arm by testing an important update that will enable more x64 software and games to run under Prism emulation. The update is specifically designed for Copilot Plus PCs powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite or X Plus processors. 11/5/2024 Microsft is set to invest nearly $10 billion in AI cloud provider CoreWeave over the next decade. The company recently signed a deal with CoreWeave to use its data centers for AI model training. However, Microsoft will continue to compete with CoreWeave through its Azure cloud business. 11/4/2024 Microsoft has purchased a large piece of land in North Carolina. The company acquired the 1,350-acre Person County Mega Park last week for $26.85 million. Microsoft hasn’t revealed specific plans for the plot. 10/31/2024 Microsoft released its quarterly earnings report, which showed a 16% increase in sales, reaching $65.6, and an 11% rise in profit to $24.7 billion ($3.30 per share), exceeding Wall Street expectations. 10/29/2024 Microsoft has made several accusations against Google, claiming that Google is trying to discredit Microsoft’s cloud business, Azure. Google has also filed an antitrust complaint against Microsoft. 10/28/2024 Microsoft will release its quarterly earnings report on Wednesday after the market closes. Analysts predict a 14% year-over-year surge in revenue, reaching $64.65 billion. Net income is projected to increase to $23.2 billion ($3.11 per share), up from the previous year’s $22.29 billion ($2.99 per share). 10/25/2024 Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella received quite a pay raise for the 2024 fiscal year, earning $79.1 million compared to the previous year’s $48.5 million. However, Nadella requested a reduction due to a series of cyberattacks. Microsoft’s 10-Year Market Smashing Results Here’s a table summarizing performance in share price, revenues, and profits (net income) from 2014 to 2018. Share Price Revenues Net Income 2014 $46.16 $86.83 $22.07 2015 $46.70 $93.58 $12.19 2016 $56.21 $91.15 $20.54 2017 $72.26 $96.57 $25.49 2018 $108.04 $110.36 $16.57 2019 $138.06 $125.84 $39.24 2020 $205.01 $143.02 $44.28 2021 $286.50 $168.09 $61.27 2022 $276.41 $198.27 $72.74 2023 $330.72 $211.92 $72.36 TTM $465.39 $279.99 $86.18 Revenue and net income in $billions In the last decade, Microsoft’s revenue grew 222% while its net income went from $22.07 billion to over $86 billion (in the trailing 12 months). A big driver of profits over the past decade was Microsoft’s Intelligence cloud business, which grew 18% annually and drove operating profits of $37.88 billion in 2023 from $8.44 billion in 2014. As Microsoft looks to the second of the decade, a few key areas will determine its performance. Key Drivers of Microsoft’s Stock Performance Productivity and Business Processes: Microsoft’s Office and Dynamics 365 solutions and its LinkedIn products currently make up around one-third of the company’s revenue. Office in particular holds a near monopoly in office productivity software and most 3rd party applications have embeds, making switching costs high for this business line. LinkedIn also does not have a solid competitor in the professional networking space. High growth rates in this segment, but Microsoft has the advantage of controlling its price on its high market share products. Intelligence Cloud: Microsoft’s Azure, OpenAI, GitHub, and SQL, among other cloud businesses, make up close to half of the company’s revenue. But the crown jewel is Azure which only makes up close to 30% of Microsoft’s revenue and grew 30% over the past year alone. The future of Microsoft will depend on Azure and its competition with Amazon’s (NASDAQ: AMZN) AWS will determine which company will dominate the Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and reward shareholders handsomely in the process. Personal Computing: Windows, gaming, search, and devices are currently 25% of Microsoft’s business and this segment is the most open to competitors eroding market share. Outside of Windows, which has a solidified market share (and is not likely to dwindle), Microsoft search and devices will be facing a steep uphill battle over the coming years. Its acquisition of Activision is a positive for its gaming line but personal computing will play an ancillary part in Microsoft’s future. Microsoft (MSFT) Stock Price Prediction in 2025 The current consensus 1-year price target for Microsoft stock is $500.00, which is a 19.62% upside from today’s stock price of $417.98. Of all the analysts covering Microsoft, the stock is a consensus buy, with a 1.39 “Buy” rating. 24/7 Wall Street’s 12-month forecast projects Microsoft’s stock price to be $495. We see Azure continuing its 20+% growth and earnings per share coming in right at $11.80. Microsoft (MSFT) Stock Forecast Through 2030 Year Revenue Net Income EPS 2024 $244.97 $88.93 $13.32 2025 $278.00 $99.25 $15.67 2026 $321.63 $115.65 $18.10 2027 $370.79 $136.81 $20.40 2028 $416.08 $151.87 $22.62 2029 $453.39 $166.56 $25.45 2030 $503.13 $181.71 $28.70 Revenue and net income in $billions Microsoft Share Price Estimates 2025-2030 How Microsoft’s Next 5 Years Could Play Out We expect to see revenue growth of just over 8% and EPS of $15.67 for 2025. We expect the stock to still trade at a similar multiple next year, putting our estimate for the stock price for Microsoft at $548.00 in 2025, which is 31.11% higher than the stock is trading today. Going into 2026, we estimate the price to be $633.00, with small revenue gains but margins expanding and an EPS of $18.10. We expect to see Microsoft’s P/E ratio steep down slowly each year through 2030. The stock price estimate would represent a 51.44% gain over today’s share price of $417.98. Heading into 2027, we expect the stock price increase not to be as pronounced and earnings estimates of $20.40 per share, the stock price target for the year is $652.00. That is a 3% year-over-year gain from the previous year, but still up 55.99% from today’s stock price. When predicting more than 3 years out, we expect Microsoft’s P/E ratio to drop to 30x in 2028 but grow its top line 14%. In 2028, we have Microsoft’s revenue coming in around $420 billion and an EPS of $22.62 suggesting a stock price estimate at $678.00 or a gain of 62.21% over the current stock price. 24/7 Wall Street expects Microsoft to continue its 10% revenue growth again and to generate $12.30 per share of earnings. With a price to earnings multiple of 35, the stock price in 2029 is estimated at $687.00, or a gain of 64.36% over today’s price. Microsoft Stocks Price Target for 2030 We estimate Microsoft’s stock price to be $717.00 per share with a sub-10 % year-over-year revenue growth. Our estimated stock price will be 71.54% higher than the current stock price of $417.98. Year Price Target % Change From Current Price 2024 $495.00 Upside of 18.43% 2025 $548.00 Upside of 31.11% 2026 $633.00 Upside of 51.44% 2027 $652.00 Upside of 55.99% 2028 $678.00 Upside of 62.21% 2029 $687.00 Upside of 64.36% 2030 $717.00 Upside of 71.54% Want to Retire Early?

    "text": "Outside of NVIDIA’s (NASDAQ: NVDA) recent share price going stratospheric, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has been a Wall Street darling since the company IPO’d in May 1997 at a split-adjusted price of $.07. Today, Amazon stock trades for $206.35, which means that stock is up over 211324.18% since May 1997, turning every $1000 invested into $2.114 million today. The only thing that matters from this point on is what the stock will do for the next 1, 5, and 10 years and beyond. Let’s crunch the numbers and give you our best guest on Amazon’s future share price. No one has a crystal ball and even the Wall Street “experts” are often wrong more than they are right in predicting future stock prices. We will walk through our assumptions and provide you with the story around the numbers (other sites just pick a share price without explaining why they suggest the price they do). Key Points in this Article: Future stock performance hinges on Amazon’s growth in e-commerce, AWS, and advertising amidst increasing competition. Amazon’s revenue grew 540% in the last decade, with net income rising to $30.42 billion in 2023 and projections over the next 5 years at 4.5x.

The breach was facilitated through a third-party property management vendor. The threat actor, known as “Nam3L3ss”, is a prominent figure in the cybercrime world. They leaked over 2.8 lines of Amazon employee data on BreachForums, alongside data from 25 other major organizations. 11/11/2024- Amazon is in the process of developing a new tool for its delivery drivers: smart eyeglasses. These glasses are intended to help drivers with turn-by-turn navigation to hopefully shave time off deliveries. 11/8/2024- Amazon’s stock price dipped slightly today, falling 0.8% during midday trading, reaching as low as $208.29. Trading volume was much lower than usual, with only about 7.8 million shares changing hands compared to the average daily volume of over 41 million shares. 11/7/2024- Amazon’s recently approved delivery drone service has begun in the Phoenix metro area. The MK30 drones can deliver packages weighing 5 pounds or less, but only during daylight hours. 11/6/2024- Recent speculation has suggested that Amazon’s new five-day in-office mandate is a veiled attempt to downsize its workforce or fulfill a deal with local governments. However, CEO Andy Jassy has emphasized that the company’s decision is unrelated to either theory. 11/5/2024- The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has approved Amazon’s new delivery drones. These new drones are smaller and can fly beyond the visual line of sight of pilots. 11/4/2024- The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) denied Amazon’s request to draw more power from a nearby Pennsylvania nuclear plant. This decision could hinder efforts by Amazon and other tech giants to secure additional energy from nuclear sources to fuel their growing AI operations. 10/31/2024- Amazon released its third-quarter financial report today, reporting numbers beyond Wall Street expectations. The company reported a revenue of $158.9 billion, surpassing analyst expectations of $157.2 billion. Earnings per share came in at $1.43 compared to the $1.16 anticipated by Bloomberg analysts. 10/28/2024- Tom Hoggett, the driving force behind Amazon’s rapid grocery expansion, has left the company to become the Chief Operating Officer of Wonder, a food hall startup. 10/25/2024- Amazon’s third-quarter earnings report is scheduled for release next Thursday (October 31st). Investors are eager to see if the company can deliver results that meet their expectations this time around, especially after a mixed performance in the second quarter. Amazon’s Recent Stock Success Here’s a table summarizing performance in share price, revenues, and profits (net income) from 2014 to 2017. Share Price Revenues* Net Income* 2014 $19.94 $89.0 ($.241) 2015 $15.63 $107.0 $.596 2016 $32.81 $136.0 $2.371 2017 $37.90 $177.9 $3.03 2018 $58.60 $232.9 $10.07 2019 $73.26 $280.5 $11.59 2020 $93.75 $386.1 $21.33 2021 $163.50 $469.8 $33.36 2022 $167.55 $514.0 ($2.72) 2023 $85.46 $574.78 $30.42 *Revenue and Net Income in Billions In the last decade, Amazon’s revenue grew about 540% while its net income moved from losing money to 30.42 billion in profits this past year. The ride up wasn’t always smooth, however. For example, in 2020, sales jumped 38%, and net income nearly doubled. 2021 saw a continued boom as people moved to e-commerce shopping during Covid. However, all those sales being “pulled forward” led to challenges in 2022, and the company swung to a surprise loss. As Amazon embarks into the back half of the decade, a few different key areas will determine its performance. 3 Key Drivers of Amazon’s Stock Performance E-Commerce Success: While Covid brought record sales to Amazon, it also led to many competitors investing heavily to compete with Amazon online. While e-commerce is still just 15% of retail sales, putting up huge growth rates in online sales won’t be as easy in the coming years as it was a decade ago. Amazon Web Services: Amazon Web Services 1st quarter 2024 revenue was $25.04 billion and the unit should break $100 billion in total sales this year. However, the unit’s 13% year-over-year growth isn’t as fast as competing cloud services like Microsoft’s (Nasdaq: MSFT) Azure and Google’s (Nasdaq: GOOGL) Cloud. Amazon is at risk of falling behind Microsoft before 2030 if it can’t stop market share losses. Advertising: Amazon exits 2023 with a $47 billion advertising business that grew 24% in 2023. Advertising has the ability to be another high-margin business line – Amazon currently gets most of its profits from its AWS cloud business – which has led the company past $100 billion in annual profits. Amazon (AMZN) Stock Price Prediction in 2025 The current consensus 1-year price target for Amazon stock is $220.00, which is a 6.61% upside from today’s stock price of $206.35. Of all the analysts covering Amazon, the stock is a consensus buy, with a 1.37 “Buy” rating. 24/7 Wall Street’s 12-month forecast projects Amazon’s stock price to be $225. We see AWS continue its current 12% growth rate but see Amazon’s advertising business outperforming analyst expectations, particularly in the 4th quarter of 2024 with more streaming ad impressions being sold. Amazon (AMZN) Stock Forecast Through 2030 AWS: Assuming AWS stems its market share loss and investments in AI to counterbalance the threat from Microsoft and Google. E-Commerce: Amazon continues to pour investments into e-commerce, forgoing added profits to maintain market share. Our case model assumes growth in new logistics and efficiencies from robotics in warehouses leads to this unit finally delivering strong operating profits. Advertising: Amazon’s advertising continued to grow and the now $47 billion business unit and we see a high teens growth rate compounded annually. Add all these numbers up and take out some amount for “new bets” the company will surely be investing in (and a potential dividend boost)and we see revenue in 2030 at $1.15 trillion and $131 billion in net income. Today, the company trades for about 50X earnings, which we’ll take down to 35 times as the company matures (but continues showing growth). In our analysis, Amazon is worth $2.6 trillion in 2030. Here are our revenue, net income, and company size estimates through 2030: Revenue Net Income Total Enterprise Value 2024 $638 $48.56 $1.93 2025 $710 $62.13 $2.12 2026 $788 $79.68 $2.19 2027 $867 $96.53 $2.29 2028 $957 $114.17 $2.39 2029 $1,049 $136.69 $2.5 2030 $1,149 $131.39 $2.6 *Revenue and net income reported in billions and TEV in trillions Amazon’s Share Price Estimates 2025-2030 How Amazon’s Next 5 Years Could Play Out We expect to see revenue growth of just over 11% and EPS of $5.74 for 2025. We expect the stock to still trade at a similar multiple next year, putting our estimate for the stock price for Amazon at $287 in 2025, which is 39.08% higher than the stock is trading today. Going into 2026, we estimate the price to be $371, after revenue estimates to come in around 10% higher year-over-year. With an EPS of $7.42 and in our opinion the last year Amazon trades near its current P/E of 50, 2026 could mark the year Amazon starts trading at a more mature valuation closer to 35 times earnings. That would represent a 79.79% gain over today’s share price of $206.35. Heading into 2027, we expect the stock price increase not to be as pronounced as more tempered growth is expected from Amazon and even with earnings estimates of $8.80 per share, the stock price target for the year is $308.00. That is a 17% year hit from the previous year, but still up 49.26% from today’s stock price. When predicting more than 3 years out, we expect Amazon to continue growing its top line at 10% but be more efficient and operating margins to grow. In 2028, we have Amazon’s revenue coming in around $957 billion and an EPS of $10.34 suggesting a stock price estimate at $361.90 or a gain of 75.38% over the current stock price. 24/7 Wall Street expects Amazon to continue its 10% revenue growth again and to generate $12.30 per share of earnings. With a price-to-earnings multiple of 35, the stock price in 2029 is estimated at $430.50, or a gain of 108.63% over today’s price. Amazon Stocks Price Target for 2030 We estimate Amazon’s stock price to be $370 per share with 10% year-over-year revenue growth but compressed margins from more competition in its AWS unit. Our estimated stock price for Amazon will be 79.62% higher than the current stock price, marking a double in Amazon’s stock price today of 206.35. Year Price Target % Change From Current Price 2024 $226.50 Upside of 9.76% 2025 $287.00 Upside of 39.08% 2026 $371.00 Upside of 79.79% 2027 $308.00 Upside of 49.26% 2028 $361.90 Upside of 75.38% 2029 $430.50 Upside of 108.63% 2030 $370.65 Upside of 79.62% Sponsored: Attention Savvy Investors: Speak to 3 Financial Experts – FREE Ever wanted an extra set of eyes on an investment you’re considering?

    "text": "After struggling for years, shares of Lumen Technologies (NYSE: LUMN) skyrocketed in 2024, more than doubling through the first three quarters of the year. But as the company continues operating with a negative price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, there are lingering concerns about the tech company’s future prospects. Founded in 1968, Lumen Technologies has been around a long time, so it was a surprise to some that stock was recently at risk of being delisted from the New York Stock Exchange when in 2023, its price per share briefly dipped under $1.00 on Nov. 1, 2023. Those struggles continued into 2024, but by mid-summer, the stock surged when demand for its high-speed fiber-network solutions began to grow. The company recently secured deals with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and other leading tech companies, like Corning Inc. (NYSE: GLW), that are requiring increased connectivity between their data centers because of the explosive growth of artificial intelligence (AI). But after posting positive earnings to end FY 2022 and and repeat that success in the first two quarters of 2023 — including a sizable beat on earnings per share (EPS) of 43 cents to analysts’ expectations of 23 cents in Q4 of 2022 — Lumen has gone on to post negative EPS in four of the following five quarters as the company’s revenues have fallen steadily over the same period. So 24/7 Wall Street performed analysis to determine if the company is fundamentally flawed, or if AI demand and strategic partnerships will be enough to see its stock continue on its bull run. Key Points in This Article: Lumen Technologies’ net income losses were enormous last year, but on a trailing 12-month basis, there is a different story emerging that could suggest a turnaround of the company’s income statement. The company’s P/E ratio has been in negative territory six out of the past seven years, but the shift towards auxiliary AI services may right the ship.

Lumen Technologies’ Recent Stock Success From July 1, 2024, to Sept. 30, 2024, shares of LUMN went on a tear. The stock, which was trading at just $1.11 at the start of the third quarter of 2024, surged 540% by the end of Q3. That was quite the reversal given how the stock has slid 86.49% since hitting its all-time high of $49.45 on June 1, 2007. But market drivers are far different today than they were then, and with the emphasis on AI development, Lumen Technologies’ stock is on a bounce back after falling -11.69% over the past five years: Year Share Price Revenue* Net Income* 2014 $39.70 $18.031 $0.851 2015 $25.87 $17.900 $0.795 2016 $24.12 $17.470 $0.744 2017 $16.99 $17.656 $0.356 2018 $14.90 $23.433 $0.964 2019 $13.42 $22.401 $5.157 2020 $9.75 $20.712 $1.351 2021 $12.55 $19.687 $2.019 2022 $5.22 $17.478 $1.713 2023 $1.83 $14.557 $7.334 *Revenue and net income in $billions Over the course of the last decade, Lumen’s revenue decreased by more than 19% while net income gained by over 761.81%. As the company battled through its dated infrastructure and a significant debt load — shares fell significantly from $39.70 in 2014 to $1.83 in 2023. However, Lumen has been able to better balance its books, with total assets and total liabilities nearly aligned in 2023 to the tune of $34.02 billion and $33.57 billion, respectively. As the 56-year-old tech company looks forward to the second half of the decade, 24/7 Wall Street has identified three key drivers that are likely to positively impact Lumen Technologies’ growth metrics and stock performance through 2030. Key Drivers of Lumen Technologies’ Stock Performance 1. Strategic Partnerships With Tech Giants: The aforementioned strategic partnerships with Microsoft, the second-largest publicly traded company by market cap at $3.096 trillion, and Corning with its $36.16 billion market cap, should position Lumen for increased revenues and earnings for the foreseeable future. The partnership, announced in early August 2024, will result in Lumen more than doubling its total intercity network miles in order to unlock the next phases and capabilities of AI for cloud data centers (like Microsoft’s), enterprises and public agencies. According to the company’s press release, Lumen expects the deal with Microsoft to improve its cash flow by more than $20 million over the next 12 months. 2. Debt Restructuring: In March 2024, the company announced it had successfully extended its debt maturities, closing an approximately $1 billion revolving credit line maturing in June 2028 and completing the private placement of $1.325 billion due in November 2029. These efforts should free up funds and allow the company to address capital expenditures that will enable it to address the demands of the previously discussed strategic partnerships with Microsoft and Corning. 3. Insider Activity: While insider trading is never an absolute indication of growth, following the money can suggest what company executives’ sentiment is. And over the past 12 months, Lumen Technologies’ insiders have been doing far more buying than they have been selling. In fact, inside buyers have purchased a total of 12,924,936 million shares versus insider sellers offloading just 2,913,990. Put differently, the leadership at Lumen has out out-purchased sellers by more than 343% over the past year. Lumen Technologies (LUMN) Price Prediction in 2025 According to analysts, the current consensus median one-year price target for Lumen Technologies is $4.00, which represents more than 60.51% downside potential over the next 12 months given the current price per share of $10.13. Of 12 analysts covering LUMN, nine rate the stock as a ‘Hold,’ with the consensus rating being 3.15 on a scale from 1 (‘Strong Buy’) to 5 (‘Strong Sell’). By the end of 2025, 24/7 Wall Street‘s forecast for shares of LUMN is higher at $6.30, which only represents a downside potential of -37.80%, based on an annualized EPS of -46 cents. Lumen Technologies (LUMN) Stock Forecast Through 2030 Year Revenue* EPS 2025 $12.407 -$0.46 cents 2026 $12.229 -$0.26 cents 2027 $12.369 $0.05 cents 2028 $12.473 $0.39 cents 2029 $12.862 $0.38 cents 2030 $13.070 $0.69 cents *Revenue in $billions How Lumen Technologies’ Next Five Years Could Play Out By the end of 2025, 24/7 Wall Street‘s forecast for shares of LUMN is higher at $6.30, which only represents a downside potential of -37.80%, based on an annualized EPS of -46 cents. However, beginning in 2027 and continuing through 2030, we expect LUMN to post positive EPS growing from 5 cents to 59 cents based on revenue growth from $12.369 billion in 2027 to $13.070 billion in 2030. Lumen Technologies’ Price Target for 2030 By the conclusion of 2030, 24/7 Wall Street estimates that Lumen Technologies stock will be trading for $7.40 per share. Year Price Target 2025 $6.30 2026 $6.20 2027 $6.50 2028 $6.70 2029 $7.10 2030 $7.40 The #1 Thing to Do Before You Claim Social Security (Sponsor) Choosing the right (or wrong) time to claim Social Security can dramatically change your retirement.
