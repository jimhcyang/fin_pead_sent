U.S. to Isolate China 12:53 pm U.S. authorities are preparing to engage in talks with over 70 countries, urging them to block Chinese goods from passing through their territories, according to the WSJ. The U.S. aims to economically &#8220;cut off&#8221; China. This aligns with President Trump&#8217;s recent statement suggesting nations might need to choose between aligning with the U.S. or China. The approach seems to focus on fully isolating China, while China has pledged to stand firm. Technology Stocks Upgrades and Downgrades 11:00 am MSFT (Microsoft) Downgrade Details: BMO Capital reduced price target from $490 to $470, maintains Outperform rating. Reason: Slower growth in Azure&#8217;s legacy cloud business due to weaker economy, leading to reduced Azure growth estimates for next few quarters and FY26. Insight: Experts indicate slowdown in core legacy cloud businesses. BMO suggests lower capex intensity in FY26 could be a positive catalyst for shares. NVDA (Nvidia) Issue: U.S. Government now requires licenses to ship H20/equivalent AI chips to China and arms-embargoed countries. Nvidia announced $5.5B charge in fiscal Q1 for inventory, purchase commitments, and reserves. Impact: Charge suggests high likelihood of H20 restrictions and low chance of future licenses. Q1 GAAP EPS may take a 20% hit, but non-GAAP sales/EPS less affected. Analyst View: BofA calls restriction &#8220;unwelcome but somewhat expected,&#8221; deems risk &#8220;manageable.&#8221; Maintains Buy rating, but lowered price target from $200 to $160. MRVL (Marvell) Downgrade Details: BofA cut price target from $120 to $72, retains Buy rating. Context: Expects Q1 results to beat due to conservative outlooks and tariff-related demand pull-ins. However, tariffs pose risks: Modest tariffs: 4%-6% sales hit, 12%-13% EPS hit. Deeper tariffs: 9% and 12% sales decline in 2025 and 2026, respectively. Reason: Lowered targets across semis coverage due to growing tariff uncertainty. TSLA (Tesla) Downgrade Details: Piper Sandler reduced price target from $450 to $400, maintains Overweight rating. Reason: Q1 deliveries (337,000 units) missed consensus, likely pushing gross margins to multi-year lows. Lack of clarity on Model 2 specs/pricing hinders reliance on new products for growth. Outlook: Short-term bearish due to weak Q1 financials, but &#8220;big picture&#8221; catalysts could drive sharp rallies. Estimates cut to reflect challenging near-term outlook. The semiconductor sector’s woes are hammering tech ETFs, with funds heavy in Nvidia and other chipmakers leading the market’s slide. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), packed with names like Nvidia, AMD, and ASML, cratered over 3.75% after the U.S. tightened export controls on AI chips to China. Nvidia, the ETF’s top holding, warned of a $5.5 billion charge as its H20 processors now require export licenses. The restrictions also hit AMD as the company export controls to apply to MI308 products, resulting in $800 million. Both stocks plunging close to 6% so far today. ASML, a key supplier of chip-making equipment, sank 5.75% after dismal order numbers and tariff warnings. Nasdaq Composite: -1.76% S&amp;P 500: -1.00% Dow Jones Industrial Average: -0.42% Today&#8217;s selling pressure raised the CBOE VIX index 3% after market fear dissipated the past two days.

Ever since President Donald Trump announced his policy of reciprocal tariffs to level the international trade playing field, the stock and bond markets have both become cyclonic in their volatility. 2,000+ point intraday swings in either direction on the Dow Jones Average and a 50 basis point swing for the 10-year Treasury Bond yield in less than a month have given even veteran investors bouts of nausea. As a result, investors from all levels of experience are looking at their portfolios and considering reassessment of their holdings, at least to better handle the current volatility and to reduce the sleepless nights of worry. Key Points The current turbulence in the stock markets are giving both novice and seasoned investors some cause for reconsidering their portfolio compositions. ETFs like SCHD have aspects like dividend focus, which may make them less volatile than ones like VOO, which exclusively tracks the S&amp;P 500 Index. People who are new to investing can find the gigantic menu of choices overwhelming and intimidating, so knowing one’s own goals and risk tolerance before selecting an investment vehicle is a prudent rule of thumb to follow.

Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here here.(Sponsor) Navigating Through A Huge Menu Of Selections The huge array of available investment selections can be intimidating and overwhelming neophyte investors. A relatively new investor with $3,000 to invest was seeking vehicle suggestions, and posted a question on Reddit. He was considering the following, but was open to any other suggestions: He was considering investing in the Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF (NYSE: SCHD) based on what he’d read from other posts. The poster was looking to contribute $100 per week to take advantage of compounding and dollar cost averaging. Admittedly young and inexperienced, he did understand how investing for the long-term was to his advantage, so he was not seeking quick, short-term gains. He was concerned with putting all of his cookies in a single basket, so was inquiring about opinions on diversifying an allocation into the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSE: VOO). To his credit, the poster realizes now that the Millennial FIRE (Financial Independence Retire Early) meme of “VOO and chill” might not be an appropriate direction to take in the current climate. Nevertheless, he acknowledges the long-term track record of the S&amp;P 500 and how it has benefited millions who have contributed to it regularly and let it compound to build wealth. As the poster has already established long term goals, assessing risk tolerance is probably the next factor to identify before finalizing his course of action. Taking a closer look at SCHD and VOO is probably a prudent step to accomplish this step. (All market quote details are as of the time of this writing.)

As one might expect, a number of the respondents agreed that some diversification was a good idea, as was the plan to invest a new contribution every week. Some of the the specifics included: Due to his youth, some suggested that it would behoove the poster to focus more on growth, and suggested SCHG (Schwab Large Cap Growth ETF), which has a superior ROI history over SCHD. In either case, reinvesting dividends to leverage compounding over the long haul was advised. Some lauded the dividend consideration, since the extra income could serve as a safety net in the event that the poster’s job were to be in jeopardy in the future. Another respondent agreed with adding VOO, but also including an ETF for international exposure so that in the event of a US economic downturn, there would be non-US holdings that could potentially offset any bearishness from the other holdings.

It took 15 years to regain that level after a collapse. That year&#8217;s drop hammered it to 1,114 in October, a 78% drop. When it peaked that March, it had risen by 800% in the previous five years. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: The stock market could drop by more than half Worry about inflation and AI valuations. Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) A similar drop in the value of the Nasdaq today would take it from its 20,0000 peak two months ago to 5,400. It seems impossible, but is it? A few of the largest cap stocks in the world have had huge runups in the last five years. Nvidia has risen 1,433%, and several other Magnificent Seven stocks have almost tripled. The cause of the Nasdaq&#8217;s collapse today would be very different from that of 2000. Hundreds of companies that went public a quarter of a century ago were losing money. When the capital available to them dried up, the shares of most collapsed, and some went out of business. Even companies with strong prospects, like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), took share price beatings. Three factors would cause a deep drop in the market. The first is that the market is considered rich on multiple levels. The S&amp;P 500 PE is 26, which is high unless this year’s earnings are strong across the market. Two other things could crush the market. The first is hyperinflation, which tariffs, the equivalent of a tax on everything from cars to toys, would bring on. American household income will be unable to keep up with double-digit price surges. True hyperinflation occurs when prices go up 50%. Inflation hit the U.S. by 18% in 1980, driven to some extent by energy prices. The Fed raised rates to 19%. The economy was pounded into a recession from 1980 to 1982, and the stock market took a brutal beating. The other significant risk is an AI valuation implosion. Big tech shareholders already worry that the industry has invested more money in AI than it can get as a return on investment in the next few years. Companies have already prepared to invest tens of billions of dollars in server farms to expand because the US does not have that supply today. They have also invested or plan to put billions of dollars into Nvidia&#8217;s (NASDAQ: NVDA) chips. Nvidia&#8217;s value relies on that continuing. The more dangerous and harder-to-forecast problem is that AI could begin to threaten humans. It is not an edge case. Wide-regarded Scientific American recently wrote, “Artificial intelligence algorithms will soon reach a point of rapid self-improvement that threatens our ability to control them and poses great potential risk to humanity.” From an investor’s standpoint, AI could lose most, if not all, of its value, under those circumstances. It is hard to believe that the stock market could lose all of its value, but not that many decades ago, it did.

After spiraling by over 600 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished in the green, while the S&amp;P 500 similarly eked out a modest gain. The Nasdaq Composite finished slightly lower, but far from its worst levels of the day. While recession fears have been stoked now that the economy is officially slowing down, the markets shook it off, perhaps in anticipation of Meta (Nasdaq: META) and Microsoft&#8217;s (Nasdaq: MSFT) earnings this afternoon. Stocks Trim Losses 12:19 pm by Gerelyn Terzo President Trump has attributed the unexpected GDP contraction to the Biden Administration, surmising that economic growth will &#8220;take a while.&#8221; In the meantime, he urges Americans to stay patient as the next economic boom awaits. Stocks have trimmed their losses. NVDA a Sell 12:07 pm by Gerelyn Terzo One Wall Street firm has turned cautious on the AI boom. Seaport Research has reportedly downgraded shares of AI darling Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) to a &#8220;sell&#8221; rating, owing to worries about AI spending from businesses. Analyst Jay Goldberg believes that while Nvidia was a clear winner in the AI mania, the prospects are already built into the stock. Nvidia stock has shaved off 20% of its value year-to-date. The stock market has come off its lows of the day, with the Nasdaq Composite trimming its declines from approximately 3% to 1% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 are down fractionally. Today&#8217;s sell-off was sparked by an economic contraction in Q1, thrusting the possibility of a recession further into the spotlight. Markets Off Worst Levels 10:53 am by Gerelyn Terzo In what is shaping up to be an historic market sell-off, stocks have come off their worst levels of the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has trimmed its losses from over 600 points to about 400 points, while the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 are down by barely 2% each. In addition to the GDP shocker, the markets received more economic data to process from the labor market. Private payrolls rose by 62,000 in April, falling short of Dow Jones expectations for nearly double that growth. March saw a gain of 147,000 private payrolls, making the sting even worse. Companies are placing hiring on hold as they await the full impact of the Trump administration&#8217;s tariffs. Stock Market Drawdown 10:08 am by Gerelyn Terzo According to Goldman Sachs, if the economy were to slip into a recession, the stock market selling would intensify. Goldman Sachs Micro Strategist Vicky Chang warned that unlike past market cycles, this time around, headline risk signals the market bottom, not the economic trough, saying, &#8220;We still think there is significant vulnerability in a recession scenario, even if the worst of the underlying ‘shock’ has passed.&#8221; The economic slowdown is real. The U.S. economy contracted by 0.3% during Q1 2025 after corporate America rushed to receive imports before the tariffs kicked in. According to the Commerce Department, U.S. GDP declined at an annual rate of 0.3%, adjusted for inflation, the worst drop the economy has suffered in in three years. By way of comparison, economists were predicting an economic expansion of 0.4% in the first quarter, a far cry from the results as the tariff wars took hold. Stocks went into freefall mode in response, including a 600-point decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite spiraled by 2.7% and the S&amp;P 5oo lost 2.0%. Every single sector of the economy is trading lower as fears of an economic recession grip the markets. Each of the Magnificent Seven stocks are under pressure, including a steep 6% drop in Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) and declines of close to 4% for Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) and Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN). What a day for Meta Platforms (Nasdaq: META) to be reporting quarterly earnings after the closing bell today. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 646.83 (-1.6%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 454.57 (-2.6%) S&amp;P 500: Down 111.05 (-1.9%) Market Movers Starbucks (Nasdaq: SBUX) is losing 8% on the day and has been downgraded by Goldman Sachs to a &#8220;neutral&#8221; rating from &#8220;&#8216;buy&#8221; with a $85 price target attached, down from a previous target of over $100 per share. Starbucks reported Q1 results and missed Wall Street estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Social media platform Snap (NYSE: SNAP) is falling by over 15% this morning in the market sell-off after choosing to forego earnings guidance due to uncertainty from tariffs. First Solar (Nasdaq: FSLR) is losing 10% on the day after missing Q1 estimates and revealing the toll that tariffs will take on its revenue in 2025.

However, investing in dividend payers can be a wise move, regardless of one&#8217;s age. Arguably, it&#8217;s better to go for the proven blue chips with dividends as a beginning investor than jump into the deep end with incredibly volatile but exciting growth stocks. When it comes to hot growth stocks, the stakes are higher, and a new investor may be more inclined to &#8220;chase&#8221; momentum and be startled out of a position when such momentum reverses. In any case, there&#8217;s really no right age to take on more of a dividend strategy. Ultimately, it depends on one&#8217;s needs, goals, and tolerance for risk. Most young people should be in growth mode as they look to maximize the appreciation of their nest eggs. And while dividends can be a nice-to-have for such new, young investors, it&#8217;s worth noting that a dividend strategy isn&#8217;t always the most tax-efficient way to go. Additionally, a dividend-focused strategy is not a proven way to beat the markets consistently over the long haul. A t the end of the day, more money paid out in dividends means less for a company to reinvest into its growth drivers. Often, lower growth means higher dividend yields, and vice versa. Though some exceptions can be made during the depths of a stock market correction or crash. In this piece, we&#8217;ll look at common approaches among investors in different age groups to help readers better find the right allocation. Key Points Younger investors should favor growth over yield while gradually transitioning as they age and their passive income needs grow. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Younger investors: Go for growth Young investors in their 20s and 30s should seek to have a heavier allocation towards the types of growth stocks that have little (or no) dividends. Indeed, we&#8217;re talking about yields south of the 1% mark. And while a few extra dollars in dividend income are nice to have, one must remember that any such dividends should be reinvested anyhow to jolt one&#8217;s growth. In any case, I think it makes less sense to have more than 25% of one&#8217;s equity portfolio in high-yielding dividend stocks unless there&#8217;s some specific passive income need that needs to be met. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which yields 0.84%, stands out as a perfect holding for a younger investor who prioritizes capital gains over dividends. And while the yield is quite small, I am a fan of the dividend growth trajectory as the company executes on the AI boom. With around 30% of code reportedly now generated by AI, at least according to CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft seems to have the perfect AI flywheel that could power it to robust gains over the long haul. Middle-aged investors: Go for dividend growth For someone in middle age, opting for a dividend and growth mix seems to make the most sense. Whether that entails 50% in dividend stocks and 50% in higher-growth names, finding the right balance as one begins the process of winding down in their 40s and 50s for a potentially early retirement could prove wise. Additionally, dividend-growth stocks that have a long history of raising dividends by double-digit percentage amounts in any given year could be an excellent choice. For instance, shares of the Home Depot (NYSE:HD) stand out as a stellar option, given its robust dividend and respectable growth profile. The home improvement firm has a wide moat surrounding its corner of the market, which has allowed it to average around 15% in dividend growth over the past five years. With a solid 2.56% dividend yield and above-average dividend growth prospects, HD stock stands out as a perfect bet for dividend investors in their 40s or 50s. Retirement age: Doubling down on passive income Finally, someone in retirement may wish to go heavier on the dividend stocks. While it may still be hard to live off dividends alone, I do think that those with enough passive income streams (think pensions, Social Security, etc) may have the opportunity to minimize the withdrawal from their invested principal. For such income-focused retirees, the iShares International Select Dividend ETF (IDV) stands out, with a nice 5.6% yield and broad exposure to the developed international markets beyond the U.S. Also, as the tariff war continues, the international financial markets may not have as much downside risk as the S&amp;P 500.

By owning shares in companies that pay regular dividends, investors gain consistent cash flow, often from stable, high-quality firms like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) or Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). Dividends provide a hedge against market volatility, as payouts persist even during downturns, and reinvesting them can compound returns significantly over time. Moreover, dividend-paying stocks historically outperform non-dividend peers, with lower volatility. 24/7 Wall St. Insights: Dividend stock investing has proven a reliable path for investors to gather immense wealth over time. Dividend ETFs bolster those results by investing in hundreds of dividend-paying stocks, offering instant diversification and minimizing single-stock risk.

Recently, it has traded down only 7% for the year. It has only been a quarter of a century since the last market wipeout. The Nasdaq dropped 75% from March 2000 to October 2002. Most of the reason was the .com companies had raised too much money as their losses mounted, and the value of their business models was viewed as unsustainable. Key Points The Market Could Drop 50% Trillions Of Dollars Would Disappear Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) The most notable part of the market crash was that it destroyed company stocks with strong business models that are today&#8217;s market titans, including Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). When the market imploded, Microsoft’s market cap dropped 65%. If the market dropped 75% today, the Nasdaq would collapse from 17,100 to 4,475, and its market value would collapse by $23 trillion, hammering the wealth of many Americans. It is worth noting that the 2000 to 2022 Nasdaq market collapse was not accompanied by a significant recession. GDP fell only .3% in that period, and unemployment rose to 5.5%. That is hardly a recession at all. One of the first signs of a new, sharp market drop is that stocks in the AI craze have started to crater. AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), considered the No. 2 AI chip maker, traded at $227 in March last year. A few weeks ago, it dropped to $88 and has since recovered to $102. Palantir (NASDAQ: PLTR) reached $125 in February last year. It dropped to $74 early last month, a 40% drop. It recently moved up to $117. What is critical about Palantir and AMD is that they are remarkably healthy companies with growing revenue and what appear to be successful models, unlike the .com companies of 2000 and 2002. Nevertheless, their shares collapsed. If there is a massive market sell-off, it would happen for one of two reasons. The first is that the huge bet on AI falters. It could. Companies could get “out over their skis.” Meta (NASDAQ: META) says it will invest $50 billion to $75 billion in AI this year. Microsoft has pegged its investment at $80 billion for the same period. AI is supposed to change the world. Many public companies with prospects driven by AI investments are supposed to have tremendous revenue growth unless they don’t. The other threat to the market is hyperinflation. Inflation rose to 14% in 1979. If there is a similar problem this year, it will be because of tariffs, which could be as high as 100% on Chinese goods. The inflationary problem would ripple across the US economy in months. Sixty percent of US adults own stocks. That statistic says everything.

When the U.S. and China meet again in the next few weeks, they’ll work out a bigger agreement on trade. While nothing has been set in stone with that just yet, markets are still celebrating today’s trade breakthrough. Here’s where that currently stands. Under the 90-day pause, both countries lowered tariffs by 115 percentage points to 10%. The 20% fentanyl-related tariff from the U.S. remains in place, so most Chinese goods face a 30% rate in total, down from 145% previously, as noted by CNBC. The Magnificent 7 Are Just Starting to Rally Back 10:50 am As of May, the Magnificent 7 lost about $6 trillion in value since their peak in late 2024. Also, at its trough, the Roundhill BIG Tech ETF (NASDAQ: MAGS) – which tracks the Magnificent 7 plummeted from about $56 to a low of $39. However, thanks to the latest U.S.-China news, the ETF is quickly rebounding higher. Making the Mag 7 even more attractive, analysts believe they can easily beat the S&amp;P 500 in earnings this year. Plus, with valuations off their 2024 peaks, investors are coming back to the table to feast. The U.S. and China have finally agreed to a temporary – but significant easing of tariffs. In fact, according to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, U.S. tariffs on China will drop 115 percentage points to 30%. China’s levies on U.S. imports will drop to 10%.

Of course, saving and investing the sum in the S&amp;P 500 would be a top choice for many. For others, using the amount as part of a down payment on a home would be a top choice. And, of course, for others looking to adapt their skillset for the artificial intelligence (AI) age, it&#8217;s all about investing in oneself to reskill ahead of the so-called fourth industrial revolution. In any case, let&#8217;s dig deeper into the case involving a 30-something who&#8217;s thinking deeply about where to put their coming windfall to work. From college, retirement, to a future home and experiences, let&#8217;s find out which expenditure would offer more bang for the buck. Key Points This Reddit user is weighing how to put their coming $80k inheritance to work. Should retirement, college, or something else take precedence? Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Option #1: Investing for retirement First up, we have good, old-fashioned investing for retirement. When in doubt, this is certainly never a bad idea, especially for those who are a bit behind when it comes to retirement milestones. For those who haven&#8217;t made good use of their tax-advantaged accounts, I&#8217;d suggest contributing and investing the proceeds in a run-of-the-mill S&amp;P 500 index fund with a low gross expense ratio. Vanguard and iShares boast the lowest fees out there with some of the most impressive liquidity, making them top picks for passive investors looking to invest their windfall wisely. Of course, there are active mutual funds that may claim to have a market-beating edge. But if you&#8217;re going to sacrifice 2% on what could be a long shot, I&#8217;d much rather go down the route of a passive investor with an S&amp;P 500 index fund or pick up shares of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B), which has some brilliant minds deploying capital without a hefty expense ratio commanded by most actively-managed mutual funds. Whether you&#8217;re a big fan of Warren Buffett, his successor Greg Abel, or the other smart folks (Ajit Jain, Ted Weschler, and Todd Combs), you&#8217;re getting a star-studded lineup for a fairly low price of admission, at least in my opinion. Whether you choose ETFs, Berkshire Hathaway, or some other investment vehicle, putting an inheritance towards retirement is a wise move that&#8217;s sure to pay dividends (unless, of course, you&#8217;re going all-in on Berkshire!). Option #2: Investing in college What&#8217;s better than investing in your retirement? Investing in yourself. Warren Buffett thinks it&#8217;s the best thing you can do. It can&#8217;t be taxed or taken away from you, and it may very well score you the best returns in life. Of course, not all college degrees and diplomas will score you a high-paying job, especially as the disruptive aura of AI approaches. In any case, I&#8217;d be cognizant of AI and strive to pursue a career that can stand tall, even as the threat of automation rises. With Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) recently laying off 6,000, questions linger as to what the future holds for a wide range of professions, from coding to management. In any case, investing in college is a fantastic way to go, especially for those who aren&#8217;t content with their current careers. Additionally, upskilling, online certificates, and lighter-weight options should also be considered depending on one&#8217;s goals. Option #3: Down payment on a home Indeed, $80,000 isn&#8217;t quite enough for a home, but it can be enough for a down payment on a modest home. Of course, there is a degree of risk in taking out leverage, especially if one&#8217;s considering going back to college. Add the uncertainty of AI-induced automation into the equation, and a mortgage seems like it&#8217;d be riskier going into the 2030s, given that the stability of many forms of employment could come into question as AI moves at a blistering pace. Option #4: Family fund for experiences Finally, for someone who doesn&#8217;t really need the cash, given they&#8217;re already financially ahead, spending down a big chunk of the sum isn&#8217;t the worst idea in the world. Of course, for frequent travellers seeking to get more mileage, a $80,000 vacation fund could be created so that one would be able to have enough to fund occasional trips in perpetuity. Based on the &#8220;4% rule,&#8221; one could draw down 4% per year (works out to $3,200 in this case) of the inheritance and have enough for a sweet trip every single year. Of course, between college and a vacation fund, I&#8217;d go with the former, especially since AI demands upskilling and adapting to the new breadth of careers that didn&#8217;t exist a decade ago, that will come to be.
