STUTTGART, Germany & REDMOND, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mercedes-Benz AG and Microsoft Corp. collaborate to make vehicle production more efficient, resilient and sustainable. With the new MO360 Data Platform, Mercedes-Benz is connecting its around 30 passenger car plants worldwide to the Microsoft Cloud, enhancing transparency and predictability across its digital production and supply chain. The MO360 Data Platform is the evolution of Mercedes-Benz’ digital production ecosystem MO360 and allows teams to identify potential supply chain bottlenecks faster and enable a dynamic prioritization of production resources towards electric and Top-End vehicles. This unified data platform is standardized on Microsoft Azure, providing Mercedes-Benz with flexibility and cloud computing power to run artificial intelligence (AI) and analytics at global scale while addressing cybersecurity and compliance standards across regions. The platform is already available to teams in EMEA and will be deployed in the United States and China. Joerg Burzer, Member of the Board of Management of Mercedes-Benz Group AG, responsible for Production & Supply Chain Management: “This new partnership between Microsoft and Mercedes-Benz will make our global production network more intelligent, sustainable and resilient in an era of geopolitical and macroeconomic challenges. The ability to predict and prevent problems in production and logistics will become a key competitive advantage as we go all electric.” Judson Althoff, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer at Microsoft: “Mercedes-Benz’ partnership with Microsoft is a testament to the power of the industrial metaverse. Together, we are merging the physical and digital worlds to accelerate value creation. Mercedes-Benz can simulate and refine manufacturing processes infinitely in the Microsoft Cloud before bringing them to the shop floor to enhance efficiency and minimize its environmental impact amid constant change and uncertainty.” Jan Brecht, Chief Information Officer of Mercedes-Benz Group AG: “With the MO360 Data Platform, we democratize technology and data in manufacturing. As we are moving towards a 100% digital enterprise, data is becoming everyone’s business at Mercedes-Benz. Our colleagues on the shop floor have access to production and management-related real-time data. They are able to work with drill-down dashboards and make data-based decisions.” Redefine production excellence with a unified data platform With the MO360 Data Platform, the Stuttgart-based carmaker can create a virtual replica of its vehicle manufacturing process, combining insights from assembly, production planning, shop floor logistics, supply chain and quality management. The virtual simulation and optimization of processes before running them on the shop floor, helps to accelerate operational efficiency and unlock energy savings. For example, managers can optimize operational patterns to reduce CO2-emissions in production. Mercedes-Benz is also exploring the integration of the MO360 Data Platform with data sources from other departments to enable a digital feedback loop that will spur continuous learning and innovation across the Group. The recently opened Mercedes-Benz Digital Factory Campus Berlin is the home base for the MO360 Data Platform engineering teams and will become the MO360 training and qualification center for implementing digital approaches globally. Increase supply chain resilience and efficiency With the new centralized data platform, teams can instantly analyze and visualize production data, to faster optimize production processes and identify potential supply chain bottlenecks. This enables a dynamic allocation of operational resources within and across plants to prioritize the manufacturing of low-emission and Top-End Luxury vehicles. The Mercedes-Benz Operations Logistics team will be able to solve supply chain bottlenecks much faster. They can compare the availability of components, including semiconductors, with production orders and position this data against production parameters including operational running plans. As a result, plant managers keep the production running and prioritize relevant vehicles even if supply chain challenges occur. Move at full speed towards an all-electric future The MO360 Data Platform will make it easier to maintain production of both electric and combustion-engine vehicles on a single production line as the market demand gradually shifts towards an all-electric future. To tackle shortages in components and prevent delivery delays, the MO360 Data Platform will enable teams to explore a variety of production scenarios depending on the availability of components like semiconductors, based on real-time data about the quality of parts and equipment. This is expected to result in productivity gains of 20 percent in passenger car production by 2025 and help to avoid unplanned downtimes and schedule maintenance work in a timely and CO2-friendly fashion. Reduce ecological footprint from water and energy use to waste management As part of the MO360 Data Platform, Mercedes-Benz has implemented an analytics tool to monitor and reduce its ecological footprint during vehicle production, a crucial milestone towards the company’s Ambition 2039 to become carbon-neutral by 2039. With the data analytics tool, teams can track and forecast carbon emissions, energy and water usage as well as waste management and roll out best practices across the production network. Mercedes-Benz plans to cover more than 70 percent of its energy needs through renewable sources by 2030 by expanding solar and wind power at its own sites and through Power Purchase Agreements and plans to cut its use of water by 351 percent through the reuse of water in production. ___________________________________ 1 in production compared to average 2013/14 Democratize data to enhance workforce productivity and distributed teamwork Mercedes-Benz production staff gets access to the MO360 Data Platform via a self-service portal available on any company device including tablets, smartphones and laptops. Its visualization with Microsoft Power BI provides a what-you-see-is-what-you-get experience, allowing employees to become data workers with the ability to model and correlate data. The Teams Walkie Talkie app provides workers with an instant push-to-talk (PTT) communication on their business phones – no extra device needed. With the MO360 Data Platform, teams at Factory 56 have shortened their daily shop floor meeting by 30 percent. In addition, they identify priority tasks to optimize production workflows within two minutes, which took up to four hours prior to the introduction of the platform. From team leads and process engineers to shop and plant managers, employees are encouraged to contribute new use cases to drive process innovation with Microsoft Power Platform. Working with a global community of internal and external developers, Mercedes-Benz’ production process software engineers are committed to open collaboration. They use Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) including GitHub to improve the quality of the software and the speed of delivery. They benefit from Azure Data Lake, Azure Databricks and Azure Purview to process and govern huge amounts of data and run AI and analytics using their preferred development frameworks. For software deployment and operations, they work with Azure DevOps. Further information about Mercedes-Benz is available at www.mercedes-benz.com.

Share Price Revenues Net Income 2014 $46.16 $86.83 $22.07 2015 $46.70 $93.58 $12.19 2016 $56.21 $91.15 $20.54 2017 $72.26 $96.57 $25.49 2018 $108.04 $110.36 $16.57 2019 $138.06 $125.84 $39.24 2020 $205.01 $143.02 $44.28 2021 $286.50 $168.09 $61.27 2022 $276.41 $198.27 $72.74 2023 $330.72 $211.92 $72.36 TTM $465.39 $279.99 $86.18 Revenue and net income in $billions In the last decade, Microsoft’s revenue grew 222% while its net income went from $22.07 billion to over $86 billion (in the trailing 12 months). A big driver of profits over the past decade was Microsoft’s Intelligence cloud business, which grew 18% annually and drove operating profits of $37.88 billion in 2023 from $8.44 billion in 2014. As Microsoft looks to the second of the decade, a few key areas will determine its performance. Key Drivers of Microsoft’s Stock Performance Productivity and Business Processes: Microsoft’s Office and Dynamics 365 solutions and its LinkedIn products currently make up around one-third of the company’s revenue. Office in particular holds a near monopoly in office productivity software and most 3rd party applications have embeds, making switching costs high for this business line. LinkedIn also does not have a solid competitor in the professional networking space. High growth rates in this segment, but Microsoft has the advantage of controlling its price on its high market share products. Intelligence Cloud: Microsoft’s Azure, OpenAI, GitHub, and SQL, among other cloud businesses, make up close to half of the company’s revenue. But the crown jewel is Azure which only makes up close to 30% of Microsoft’s revenue and grew 30% over the past year alone. The future of Microsoft will depend on Azure and its competition with Amazon’s (NASDAQ: AMZN) AWS will determine which company will dominate the Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and reward shareholders handsomely in the process. Personal Computing: Windows, gaming, search, and devices are currently 25% of Microsoft’s business and this segment is the most open to competitors eroding market share. Outside of Windows, which has a solidified market share (and is not likely to dwindle), Microsoft search and devices will be facing a steep uphill battle over the coming years. Its acquisition of Activision is a positive for its gaming line but personal computing will play an ancillary part in Microsoft’s future. Microsoft (MSFT) Stock Price Prediction in 2025 The current consensus 1-year price target for Microsoft stock is $500.00, which is a 19.62% upside from today’s stock price of $417.98. Of all the analysts covering Microsoft, the stock is a consensus buy, with a 1.39 “Buy” rating. 24/7 Wall Street’s 12-month forecast projects Microsoft’s stock price to be $495. We see Azure continuing its 20+% growth and earnings per share coming in right at $11.80. Microsoft (MSFT) Stock Forecast Through 2030 Year Revenue Net Income EPS 2024 $244.97 $88.93 $13.32 2025 $278.00 $99.25 $15.67 2026 $321.63 $115.65 $18.10 2027 $370.79 $136.81 $20.40 2028 $416.08 $151.87 $22.62 2029 $453.39 $166.56 $25.45 2030 $503.13 $181.71 $28.70 Revenue and net income in $billions Microsoft Share Price Estimates 2025-2030 How Microsoft’s Next 5 Years Could Play Out We expect to see revenue growth of just over 8% and EPS of $15.67 for 2025. We expect the stock to still trade at a similar multiple next year, putting our estimate for the stock price for Microsoft at $548.00 in 2025, which is 31.11% higher than the stock is trading today. Going into 2026, we estimate the price to be $633.00, with small revenue gains but margins expanding and an EPS of $18.10. We expect to see Microsoft’s P/E ratio steep down slowly each year through 2030. The stock price estimate would represent a 51.44% gain over today’s share price of $417.98. Heading into 2027, we expect the stock price increase not to be as pronounced and earnings estimates of $20.40 per share, the stock price target for the year is $652.00. That is a 3% year-over-year gain from the previous year, but still up 55.99% from today’s stock price. When predicting more than 3 years out, we expect Microsoft’s P/E ratio to drop to 30x in 2028 but grow its top line 14%. In 2028, we have Microsoft’s revenue coming in around $420 billion and an EPS of $22.62 suggesting a stock price estimate at $678.00 or a gain of 62.21% over the current stock price. 24/7 Wall Street expects Microsoft to continue its 10% revenue growth again and to generate $12.30 per share of earnings. With a price to earnings multiple of 35, the stock price in 2029 is estimated at $687.00, or a gain of 64.36% over today’s price. Microsoft Stocks Price Target for 2030 We estimate Microsoft’s stock price to be $717.00 per share with a sub-10 % year-over-year revenue growth. Our estimated stock price will be 71.54% higher than the current stock price of $417.98.

Outside of NVIDIA’s (NASDAQ: NVDA) recent share price going stratospheric, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has been a Wall Street darling since the company IPO’d in May 1997 at a split-adjusted price of $.07. Today, Amazon stock trades for $206.35, which means that stock is up over 211324.18% since May 1997, turning every $1000 invested into $2.114 million today. The only thing that matters from this point on is what the stock will do for the next 1, 5, and 10 years and beyond. Let’s crunch the numbers and give you our best guest on Amazon’s future share price. No one has a crystal ball and even the Wall Street “experts” are often wrong more than they are right in predicting future stock prices. We will walk through our assumptions and provide you with the story around the numbers (other sites just pick a share price without explaining why they suggest the price they do). Key Points in this Article: Future stock performance hinges on Amazon’s growth in e-commerce, AWS, and advertising amidst increasing competition. Amazon’s revenue grew 540% in the last decade, with net income rising to $30.42 billion in 2023 and projections over the next 5 years at 4.5x.

Recent Amazon Stock Updates and News 11/12/2024- Amazon confirmed that a recent cyberattack has exposed sensitive data from its employees. The breach was facilitated through a third-party property management vendor. The threat actor, known as “Nam3L3ss”, is a prominent figure in the cybercrime world. They leaked over 2.8 lines of Amazon employee data on BreachForums, alongside data from 25 other major organizations. 11/11/2024- Amazon is in the process of developing a new tool for its delivery drivers: smart eyeglasses. These glasses are intended to help drivers with turn-by-turn navigation to hopefully shave time off deliveries. 11/8/2024- Amazon’s stock price dipped slightly today, falling 0.8% during midday trading, reaching as low as $208.29. Trading volume was much lower than usual, with only about 7.8 million shares changing hands compared to the average daily volume of over 41 million shares. 11/7/2024- Amazon’s recently approved delivery drone service has begun in the Phoenix metro area. The MK30 drones can deliver packages weighing 5 pounds or less, but only during daylight hours. 11/6/2024- Recent speculation has suggested that Amazon’s new five-day in-office mandate is a veiled attempt to downsize its workforce or fulfill a deal with local governments. However, CEO Andy Jassy has emphasized that the company’s decision is unrelated to either theory. 11/5/2024- The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has approved Amazon’s new delivery drones. These new drones are smaller and can fly beyond the visual line of sight of pilots. 11/4/2024- The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) denied Amazon’s request to draw more power from a nearby Pennsylvania nuclear plant. This decision could hinder efforts by Amazon and other tech giants to secure additional energy from nuclear sources to fuel their growing AI operations. 10/31/2024- Amazon released its third-quarter financial report today, reporting numbers beyond Wall Street expectations. The company reported a revenue of $158.9 billion, surpassing analyst expectations of $157.2 billion. Earnings per share came in at $1.43 compared to the $1.16 anticipated by Bloomberg analysts. 10/28/2024- Tom Hoggett, the driving force behind Amazon’s rapid grocery expansion, has left the company to become the Chief Operating Officer of Wonder, a food hall startup. 10/25/2024- Amazon’s third-quarter earnings report is scheduled for release next Thursday (October 31st). Investors are eager to see if the company can deliver results that meet their expectations this time around, especially after a mixed performance in the second quarter. Amazon’s Recent Stock Success Here’s a table summarizing performance in share price, revenues, and profits (net income) from 2014 to 2017. Share Price Revenues* Net Income* 2014 $19.94 $89.0 ($.241) 2015 $15.63 $107.0 $.596 2016 $32.81 $136.0 $2.371 2017 $37.90 $177.9 $3.03 2018 $58.60 $232.9 $10.07 2019 $73.26 $280.5 $11.59 2020 $93.75 $386.1 $21.33 2021 $163.50 $469.8 $33.36 2022 $167.55 $514.0 ($2.72) 2023 $85.46 $574.78 $30.42 *Revenue and Net Income in Billions In the last decade, Amazon’s revenue grew about 540% while its net income moved from losing money to 30.42 billion in profits this past year. The ride up wasn’t always smooth, however. For example, in 2020, sales jumped 38%, and net income nearly doubled. 2021 saw a continued boom as people moved to e-commerce shopping during Covid. However, all those sales being “pulled forward” led to challenges in 2022, and the company swung to a surprise loss. As Amazon embarks into the back half of the decade, a few different key areas will determine its performance. 3 Key Drivers of Amazon’s Stock Performance E-Commerce Success: While Covid brought record sales to Amazon, it also led to many competitors investing heavily to compete with Amazon online. While e-commerce is still just 15% of retail sales, putting up huge growth rates in online sales won’t be as easy in the coming years as it was a decade ago. Amazon Web Services: Amazon Web Services 1st quarter 2024 revenue was $25.04 billion and the unit should break $100 billion in total sales this year. However, the unit’s 13% year-over-year growth isn’t as fast as competing cloud services like Microsoft’s (Nasdaq: MSFT) Azure and Google’s (Nasdaq: GOOGL) Cloud. Amazon is at risk of falling behind Microsoft before 2030 if it can’t stop market share losses. Advertising: Amazon exits 2023 with a $47 billion advertising business that grew 24% in 2023. Advertising has the ability to be another high-margin business line – Amazon currently gets most of its profits from its AWS cloud business – which has led the company past $100 billion in annual profits. Amazon (AMZN) Stock Price Prediction in 2025 The current consensus 1-year price target for Amazon stock is $220.00, which is a 6.61% upside from today’s stock price of $206.35. Of all the analysts covering Amazon, the stock is a consensus buy, with a 1.37 “Buy” rating. 24/7 Wall Street’s 12-month forecast projects Amazon’s stock price to be $225. We see AWS continue its current 12% growth rate but see Amazon’s advertising business outperforming analyst expectations, particularly in the 4th quarter of 2024 with more streaming ad impressions being sold. Amazon (AMZN) Stock Forecast Through 2030 AWS: Assuming AWS stems its market share loss and investments in AI to counterbalance the threat from Microsoft and Google. E-Commerce: Amazon continues to pour investments into e-commerce, forgoing added profits to maintain market share. Our case model assumes growth in new logistics and efficiencies from robotics in warehouses leads to this unit finally delivering strong operating profits. Advertising: Amazon’s advertising continued to grow and the now $47 billion business unit and we see a high teens growth rate compounded annually. Add all these numbers up and take out some amount for “new bets” the company will surely be investing in (and a potential dividend boost)and we see revenue in 2030 at $1.15 trillion and $131 billion in net income. Today, the company trades for about 50X earnings, which we’ll take down to 35 times as the company matures (but continues showing growth). In our analysis, Amazon is worth $2.6 trillion in 2030. Here are our revenue, net income, and company size estimates through 2030: Revenue Net Income Total Enterprise Value 2024 $638 $48.56 $1.93 2025 $710 $62.13 $2.12 2026 $788 $79.68 $2.19 2027 $867 $96.53 $2.29 2028 $957 $114.17 $2.39 2029 $1,049 $136.69 $2.5 2030 $1,149 $131.39 $2.6 *Revenue and net income reported in billions and TEV in trillions Amazon’s Share Price Estimates 2025-2030 How Amazon’s Next 5 Years Could Play Out We expect to see revenue growth of just over 11% and EPS of $5.74 for 2025. We expect the stock to still trade at a similar multiple next year, putting our estimate for the stock price for Amazon at $287 in 2025, which is 39.08% higher than the stock is trading today. Going into 2026, we estimate the price to be $371, after revenue estimates to come in around 10% higher year-over-year. With an EPS of $7.42 and in our opinion the last year Amazon trades near its current P/E of 50, 2026 could mark the year Amazon starts trading at a more mature valuation closer to 35 times earnings. That would represent a 79.79% gain over today’s share price of $206.35. Heading into 2027, we expect the stock price increase not to be as pronounced as more tempered growth is expected from Amazon and even with earnings estimates of $8.80 per share, the stock price target for the year is $308.00. That is a 17% year hit from the previous year, but still up 49.26% from today’s stock price. When predicting more than 3 years out, we expect Amazon to continue growing its top line at 10% but be more efficient and operating margins to grow. In 2028, we have Amazon’s revenue coming in around $957 billion and an EPS of $10.34 suggesting a stock price estimate at $361.90 or a gain of 75.38% over the current stock price. 24/7 Wall Street expects Amazon to continue its 10% revenue growth again and to generate $12.30 per share of earnings. With a price-to-earnings multiple of 35, the stock price in 2029 is estimated at $430.50, or a gain of 108.63% over today’s price. Amazon Stocks Price Target for 2030 We estimate Amazon’s stock price to be $370 per share with 10% year-over-year revenue growth but compressed margins from more competition in its AWS unit. Our estimated stock price for Amazon will be 79.62% higher than the current stock price, marking a double in Amazon’s stock price today of 206.35. Year Price Target % Change From Current Price 2024 $226.50 Upside of 9.76% 2025 $287.00 Upside of 39.08% 2026 $371.00 Upside of 79.79% 2027 $308.00 Upside of 49.26% 2028 $361.90 Upside of 75.38% 2029 $430.50 Upside of 108.63% 2030 $370.65 Upside of 79.62% Sponsored: Attention Savvy Investors: Speak to 3 Financial Experts – FREE Ever wanted an extra set of eyes on an investment you’re considering?

After struggling for years, shares of Lumen Technologies (NYSE: LUMN) skyrocketed in 2024, more than doubling through the first three quarters of the year. But as the company continues operating with a negative price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, there are lingering concerns about the tech company’s future prospects. Founded in 1968, Lumen Technologies has been around a long time, so it was a surprise to some that stock was recently at risk of being delisted from the New York Stock Exchange when in 2023, its price per share briefly dipped under $1.00 on Nov. 1, 2023. Those struggles continued into 2024, but by mid-summer, the stock surged when demand for its high-speed fiber-network solutions began to grow. The company recently secured deals with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and other leading tech companies, like Corning Inc. (NYSE: GLW), that are requiring increased connectivity between their data centers because of the explosive growth of artificial intelligence (AI). But after posting positive earnings to end FY 2022 and and repeat that success in the first two quarters of 2023 — including a sizable beat on earnings per share (EPS) of 43 cents to analysts’ expectations of 23 cents in Q4 of 2022 — Lumen has gone on to post negative EPS in four of the following five quarters as the company’s revenues have fallen steadily over the same period. So 24/7 Wall Street performed analysis to determine if the company is fundamentally flawed, or if AI demand and strategic partnerships will be enough to see its stock continue on its bull run. Key Points in This Article: Lumen Technologies’ net income losses were enormous last year, but on a trailing 12-month basis, there is a different story emerging that could suggest a turnaround of the company’s income statement. The company’s P/E ratio has been in negative territory six out of the past seven years, but the shift towards auxiliary AI services may right the ship.

Lumen Technologies’ Recent Stock Success From July 1, 2024, to Sept. 30, 2024, shares of LUMN went on a tear. The stock, which was trading at just $1.11 at the start of the third quarter of 2024, surged 540% by the end of Q3. That was quite the reversal given how the stock has slid 86.49% since hitting its all-time high of $49.45 on June 1, 2007. But market drivers are far different today than they were then, and with the emphasis on AI development, Lumen Technologies’ stock is on a bounce back after falling -11.69% over the past five years: Year Share Price Revenue* Net Income* 2014 $39.70 $18.031 $0.851 2015 $25.87 $17.900 $0.795 2016 $24.12 $17.470 $0.744 2017 $16.99 $17.656 $0.356 2018 $14.90 $23.433 $0.964 2019 $13.42 $22.401 $5.157 2020 $9.75 $20.712 $1.351 2021 $12.55 $19.687 $2.019 2022 $5.22 $17.478 $1.713 2023 $1.83 $14.557 $7.334 *Revenue and net income in $billions Over the course of the last decade, Lumen’s revenue decreased by more than 19% while net income gained by over 761.81%. As the company battled through its dated infrastructure and a significant debt load — shares fell significantly from $39.70 in 2014 to $1.83 in 2023. However, Lumen has been able to better balance its books, with total assets and total liabilities nearly aligned in 2023 to the tune of $34.02 billion and $33.57 billion, respectively. As the 56-year-old tech company looks forward to the second half of the decade, 24/7 Wall Street has identified three key drivers that are likely to positively impact Lumen Technologies’ growth metrics and stock performance through 2030. Key Drivers of Lumen Technologies’ Stock Performance 1. Strategic Partnerships With Tech Giants: The aforementioned strategic partnerships with Microsoft, the second-largest publicly traded company by market cap at $3.096 trillion, and Corning with its $36.16 billion market cap, should position Lumen for increased revenues and earnings for the foreseeable future. The partnership, announced in early August 2024, will result in Lumen more than doubling its total intercity network miles in order to unlock the next phases and capabilities of AI for cloud data centers (like Microsoft’s), enterprises and public agencies. According to the company’s press release, Lumen expects the deal with Microsoft to improve its cash flow by more than $20 million over the next 12 months. 2. Debt Restructuring: In March 2024, the company announced it had successfully extended its debt maturities, closing an approximately $1 billion revolving credit line maturing in June 2028 and completing the private placement of $1.325 billion due in November 2029. These efforts should free up funds and allow the company to address capital expenditures that will enable it to address the demands of the previously discussed strategic partnerships with Microsoft and Corning. 3. Insider Activity: While insider trading is never an absolute indication of growth, following the money can suggest what company executives’ sentiment is. And over the past 12 months, Lumen Technologies’ insiders have been doing far more buying than they have been selling. In fact, inside buyers have purchased a total of 12,924,936 million shares versus insider sellers offloading just 2,913,990. Put differently, the leadership at Lumen has out out-purchased sellers by more than 343% over the past year. Lumen Technologies (LUMN) Price Prediction in 2025 According to analysts, the current consensus median one-year price target for Lumen Technologies is $4.00, which represents more than 60.51% downside potential over the next 12 months given the current price per share of $10.13. Of 12 analysts covering LUMN, nine rate the stock as a ‘Hold,’ with the consensus rating being 3.15 on a scale from 1 (‘Strong Buy’) to 5 (‘Strong Sell’). By the end of 2025, 24/7 Wall Street‘s forecast for shares of LUMN is higher at $6.30, which only represents a downside potential of -37.80%, based on an annualized EPS of -46 cents. Lumen Technologies (LUMN) Stock Forecast Through 2030 Year Revenue* EPS 2025 $12.407 -$0.46 cents 2026 $12.229 -$0.26 cents 2027 $12.369 $0.05 cents 2028 $12.473 $0.39 cents 2029 $12.862 $0.38 cents 2030 $13.070 $0.69 cents *Revenue in $billions How Lumen Technologies’ Next Five Years Could Play Out By the end of 2025, 24/7 Wall Street‘s forecast for shares of LUMN is higher at $6.30, which only represents a downside potential of -37.80%, based on an annualized EPS of -46 cents. However, beginning in 2027 and continuing through 2030, we expect LUMN to post positive EPS growing from 5 cents to 59 cents based on revenue growth from $12.369 billion in 2027 to $13.070 billion in 2030. Lumen Technologies’ Price Target for 2030 By the conclusion of 2030, 24/7 Wall Street estimates that Lumen Technologies stock will be trading for $7.40 per share.

Los asistentes de Inteligencia Artificial de Omada aprovechan el Semantic Kernel de Microsoft para transformar la seguridad de la identidad COPENHAGUE, Dinamarca, 21 de enero de 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Omada A/S (""Omada""), líder mundial en Gobierno de Identidades y Accesos (en adelante IGA), ha anunciado la integración de su solución IGA en la nube con Microsoft Entra AI. Al asociarse con Microsoft y aprovechar su Semantic Kernel, Omada ha creado asistentes de Inteligencia Artificial (en adelante IA) centrados en la seguridad de las identidades que impulsan la automatización, mejoran la toma de decisiones y ofrecen experiencias de usuario altamente personalizadas y contextuales. El asistente de IA se ha basado en Microsoft Semantic Kernel, un potente marco de desarrollo de código abierto que permite a las empresas integrar capacidades de IA en las aplicaciones. Diseñado para ofrecer flexibilidad y escalabilidad entre los modelos avanzados de IA y los procesos de negocio, con el fin de proporcionar un rápido despliegue de soluciones inteligentes adaptadas a las necesidades específicas de cada organización. La combinación de portabilidad y extensibilidad que ofrecen los plugins convierte a Semantic Kernel en una herramienta robusta y versátil para desarrollar soluciones avanzadas de IA. Tanto si se trata de mejorar aplicaciones de Microsoft 365 como de crear copilotos personalizados, estas funciones garantizan que la IA pueda integrarse a la perfección en diversos flujos de trabajo y plataformas, proporcionando una solución potente y flexible para las empresas modernas. Para los usuarios ocasionales de los sistemas IGA, interactuar esporádicamente con estas herramientas puede ser una experiencia confusa y no siempre sencilla, que a menudo conduce a la ineficacia y a la aparición de prácticas de shadow IT. Para los usuarios frecuentes, aunque la experiencia resulte más familiar en ocasiones puede ser igualmente difícil, ya que requiere información clara y contextual sobre los solicitantes y sus necesidades. La nueva integración basada en IA aborda ambos escenarios permitiendo flujos de trabajo intuitivos y conversacionales a través de Microsoft Teams. Este enfoque reduce drásticamente la complejidad, acelera la realización de tareas y minimiza los errores humanos. La perfecta integración de Omada Identity Cloud con las capacidades de IA de Microsoft crea una experiencia más inteligente, rápida y fácil de usar. Donde los usuarios ocasionales disponen ahora de asistencia guiada para ser autosuficientes en estos entornos menos habituales. Y los usuarios frecuentes se benefician de una visión contextualizada de los solicitantes, lo que permite la toma de decisiones y un procesamiento más rápido de las solicitudes. La integración de Omada Identity Cloud con Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service y Semantic Kernel a través de Teams, transformando la experiencia del usuario para aprovechar un canal conocido y habitual del mismo, en un proceso intuitivo y conversacional para mejorar la eficacia. El resultado es una mejora de la productividad, menos cuellos de botella operativos y una reducción significativa de las solicitudes de soporte de TI. Esta integración proporciona a las organizaciones poder para: Michael Garrett, Director Ejecutivo de Omada, explicó: ""Esta innovadora asociación tecnológica con Microsoft transforma el Gobierno de la Identidad en una experiencia fluida impulsada por la IA y adaptada al lugar de trabajo moderno. De cara al futuro, estas interfaces basadas en IA pueden evolucionar hasta convertirse en sistemas altamente adaptables que ayuden en las tareas inmediatas y proporcionen una ligera formación en seguridad durante las interacciones, reforzando la comprensión del usuario de los procesos críticos de seguridad de la identidad. Esto garantiza que incluso los usuarios ocasionales puedan seguir siendo eficaces, seguros y cumpliendo con los requisitos normátivos"". Julie Mørch Nadelmann, director mundial de soluciones de socios de Microsoft Denmark, afirmó: ""Esta integración transformadora con Omada pone de relieve nuestro compromiso compartido con la innovación, proporcionando a las organizaciones las herramientas que necesitan para mantenerse eficaces, conformes y seguras. Juntos, estamos ofreciendo una experiencia fluida basada en IA y adaptada al lugar de trabajo moderno, con asistentes de IA centrados en la seguridad de la identidad que impulsan la automatización, mejoran la toma de decisiones y ofrecen experiencias de usuario personalizadas y contextuales"".

En s'appuyant sur le noyau sémantique, les assistants IA d'Omada transforment la sécurité des identités COPENHAGUE, Danemark, 21 janvier 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Omada A/S (« Omada »), leader mondial de l'administration et de la gouvernance des identités (IGA), a annoncé l'intégration de son système d'IGA nuagique moderne avec Microsoft Entra AI. En s'associant à Microsoft et en utilisant un noyau sémantique, Omada a créé des assistants IA axés sur la sécurité des identités qui favorisent l'automatisation, améliorent la prise de décision et offrent des expériences utilisateur hautement personnalisées et contextuelles. Le développement a été planifié à l'aide du noyau sémantique de Microsoft, un puissant cadre de développement source ouverte qui permet aux entreprises d'intégrer des capacités d'IA de pointe dans leurs applications de manière transparente. Conçu pour être flexible et évolutive, il fait le lien entre les modèles d'IA avancés et les processus commerciaux du monde réel, ce qui permet de déployer rapidement des solutions intelligentes adaptées aux besoins spécifiques de l'organisation. La combinaison de la portabilité et de l'extensibilité offerte par les plugins fait du noyau sémantique un outil robuste et polyvalent pour le développement de solutions d'IA avancées. Qu'il s'agisse d'améliorer les applications Microsoft 365 ou de créer des copilotes personnalisés, ces fonctionnalités garantissent que l'IA peut être intégrée de manière transparente dans divers flux de travail et plateformes, offrant ainsi une solution puissante et flexible aux entreprises modernes. Pour les utilisateurs occasionnels des systèmes d'IGA, l'interaction avec les logiciels de sécurité peut être une expérience sporadique et déroutante, conduisant souvent à des inefficacités et, dans certains cas, à l'émergence de pratiques « informatiques fantômes ». Pour les utilisateurs quotidiens, la gestion d'un grand nombre de demandes d'accès peut s'avérer tout aussi difficile, car elle nécessite des informations claires et contextuelles sur les demandeurs et leurs besoins. La nouvelle intégration pilotée par l'IA répond à ces deux scénarios en permettant des flux de travail intuitifs et conversationnels par l'intermédiaire de Microsoft Teams. Cette approche réduit considérablement la complexité, accélère l'exécution des tâches et minimise les erreurs humaines. L'intégration transparente d'Omada Identity Cloud avec les capacités d'IA de Microsoft crée une expérience plus intelligente, plus rapide et plus conviviale. Les utilisateurs occasionnels disposent désormais d'une assistance guidée pour naviguer dans des interactions complexes et peu fréquentes. De leur côté, les utilisateurs fréquents bénéficient d'une vue contextualisée des demandeurs, ce qui leur permet de prendre des décisions plus éclairées et de traiter les demandes plus rapidement. L'intégration d'Omada Identity Cloud avec Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service et le noyau sémantique par l'intermédiaire de Teams transforme l'expérience utilisateur en un processus intuitif et conversationnel, aidant les utilisateurs à naviguer plus efficacement dans leurs tâches. Il en résulte une amélioration de la productivité, une diminution des goulets d'étranglement opérationnels et une réduction significative des demandes d'assistance informatique ; désormais, les utilisateurs peuvent compter sur l'assistant IA activé par Teams pour les guider dans leurs tâches et les aider à devenir plus intuitifs, plus réactifs et plus centrés sur l'utilisateur. Cette intégration permet aux organisations de : Michael Garrett, PDG d'Omada, a déclaré : « Ce partenariat technologique innovant avec Microsoft transforme la gouvernance des identités en une expérience transparente pilotée par l'IA et adaptée au lieu de travail moderne. À l'avenir, ces interfaces pilotées par l'IA peuvent évoluer vers des systèmes hautement adaptatifs qui aident à accomplir des tâches immédiates et fournissent une formation légère en matière de sécurité pendant les interactions, renforçant ainsi la compréhension par l'utilisateur des processus essentiels en matière de sécurité de l'identité. Ainsi, même les utilisateurs occasionnels peuvent rester efficaces, conformes et sûrs ». Julie Mørch Nadelmann, responsable mondial des solutions, Microsoft Danemark, a ajouté : « Cette intégration transformatrice avec Omada souligne notre engagement commun en faveur de l'innovation, en fournissant aux organisations les outils dont elles ont besoin pour rester efficaces, conformes et sécurisées. Ensemble, nous offrons une expérience transparente axée sur l'IA et adaptée au lieu de travail moderne, avec des assistants IA axés sur la sécurité de l'identité qui favorisent l'automatisation, améliorent la prise de décision et offrent des expériences utilisateur personnalisées et contextuelles. » À propos d'Omada Omada, leader mondial du marché de l'administration et de la gouvernance des identités (IGA), propose unesolution IGA cloud native complète et de qualité professionnelle, qui permet aux entreprises de se conformer aux normes, de réduire les risques et de maximiser l'efficacité.

Leveraging Semantic Kernel, Omada's AI assistants transform identity security COPENHAGEN, Denmark, Jan. 21, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Omada A/S (""Omada""), a global leader of Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) announced an integration of modern cloud IGA from Omada with Microsoft Entra AI. By partnering with Microsoft and leveraging Semantic Kernel, Omada has created AI assistants focused on identity security that drive automation, enhance decision-making and deliver highly personalized and contextual user experiences. The development has been planned with the use of Microsoft Semantic Kernel, a powerful, open-source development framework that empowers businesses to integrate cutting-edge AI capabilities into applications seamlessly. Designed for flexibility and scalability, it bridges advanced AI models and real-world business processes, enabling rapid deployment of intelligent solutions tailored to specific organizational needs. The combination of portability and extensibility offered by plugins makes Semantic Kernal a robust and versatile tool for developing advanced AI solutions. Whether enhancing Microsoft 365 applications or building custom copilots, these features ensure that AI can be seamlessly integrated into various workflows and platforms, providing a powerful and flexible solution for modern enterprises. For occasional users of IGA systems, interacting with security software can be a sporadic and confusing experience, often leading to inefficiencies and, in some cases, the emergence of ""shadow IT"" practices. For daily users, managing large volumes of access requests can be equally challenging, requiring clear, contextual information on requesters and their needs. The new AI-driven integration addresses both scenarios by enabling intuitive, conversational workflows through Microsoft Teams. This approach drastically reduces complexity, accelerates task completion, and minimizes human errors. Omada Identity Cloud's seamless integration with Microsoft's AI capabilities creates a smarter, faster, and more user-friendly experience. Occasional users now have guided assistance in navigating infrequent, complex interactions. Meanwhile, frequent users benefit from a contextualized view of requesters, enabling more informed decisions and faster request processing. Integrating Omada Identity Cloud with Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service and Semantic Kernel through Teams transforms the user experience into an intuitive, conversational process, helping users navigate tasks more effectively. The result is improved productivity, fewer operational bottlenecks, and a significant reduction in IT support requests; now, users can rely on the Teams-powered AI assistant to guide them through their tasks and help them become more intuitive, responsive and user-centric. This integration gives organizations the power to: Michael Garrett, CEO, Omada, said: ""This innovative technology partnership with Microsoft transforms identity governance into a seamless AI-driven experience tailored to the modern workplace. Looking ahead, such AI-driven interfaces can evolve into highly adaptive systems that assist with immediate tasks and provide light security training during interactions, reinforcing the user's understanding of critical identity security processes. This ensures that even occasional users can stay effective, compliant and secure."" Julie Mørch Nadelmann, Global Partner Solutions Lead, Microsoft Denmark said: ""This transformative integration with Omada highlights our shared commitment to innovation, providing organizations with the tools they need to stay effective, compliant and secure. Together, we're delivering a seamless AI-driven experience tailored to the modern workplace, featuring AI assistants focused on identity security that drive automation, enhance decision-making and deliver personalized, contextual user experiences.""

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates offered his perspective on a range of subjects, including President Donald Trump’s reform task force and the Department of Government Efficiency on Sunday. What Happened: A Wall Street Journal interview revealed that Gates is in favor of the Elon Musk-led task force’s efforts to reduce federal spending. Gates stated, “I'm among the people who think the deficit needs to be brought down because otherwise it will create a financial problem for us.” Despite his support, Gates expressed concern over the complete elimination of certain programs under the new entity. He underscored the significance of long-term beneficial programs like HIV treatment initiatives. Gates warned, “If you cut those off, not only would they die when we have a cure on its way, but the negative feelings you'd have say, in Africa, would be worse than never having done the thing at all.” The interview also saw Gates discussing his childhood, U.S.-China relations, and his ties with Jeffrey Epstein.

The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which Gates supports, has been a topic of debate with figures like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) weighing in. Sanders supported DOGE’s focus on the Pentagon’s budget. More recently, Warren suggested changes for DOGE, including better negotiation of Department of Defense contracts. DOGE department shares its name acronym with Dogecoin DOGE/USD and the disappearance of Dogecoin iconography led to a fall in the cryptocurrency’s price recently.

Nvidia Corporation NVDA shares fell notably in overnight Robinhood trading on Sunday as China's DeepSeek unveiled an AI model that reportedly offers cutting-edge performance at a fraction of the cost. This development has sparked doubts about the need for massive GPU investments. What Happened: DeepSeek, backed by Chinese quant firm High-Flyer, launched its R1 language model (LLM) as open source last week. It also published a technical report asserting that advanced AI systems can be developed on substantially smaller budgets. 🚀 DeepSeek-R1 is here!⚡ Performance on par with OpenAI-o1📖 Fully open-source model & technical report🏆 MIT licensed: Distill & commercialize freely!🌐 Website & API are live now!

META, Microsoft Corporation MSFT, and Alphabet Inc. GOOG GOOGL. DeepSeek reportedly used roughly 50,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs. However, the extent of this hardware usage remains unclear.

Live Updates Live Coverage Updates appear automatically as they are published. U.S. to Isolate China 12:53 pm U.S. authorities are preparing to engage in talks with over 70 countries, urging them to block Chinese goods from passing through their territories, according to the WSJ. The U.S. aims to economically &#8220;cut off&#8221; China. This aligns with President Trump&#8217;s recent statement suggesting nations might need to choose between aligning with the U.S. or China. The approach seems to focus on fully isolating China, while China has pledged to stand firm. Technology Stocks Upgrades and Downgrades 11:00 am MSFT (Microsoft) Downgrade Details: BMO Capital reduced price target from $490 to $470, maintains Outperform rating. Reason: Slower growth in Azure&#8217;s legacy cloud business due to weaker economy, leading to reduced Azure growth estimates for next few quarters and FY26. Insight: Experts indicate slowdown in core legacy cloud businesses. BMO suggests lower capex intensity in FY26 could be a positive catalyst for shares. NVDA (Nvidia) Issue: U.S. Government now requires licenses to ship H20/equivalent AI chips to China and arms-embargoed countries. Nvidia announced $5.5B charge in fiscal Q1 for inventory, purchase commitments, and reserves. Impact: Charge suggests high likelihood of H20 restrictions and low chance of future licenses. Q1 GAAP EPS may take a 20% hit, but non-GAAP sales/EPS less affected. Analyst View: BofA calls restriction &#8220;unwelcome but somewhat expected,&#8221; deems risk &#8220;manageable.&#8221; Maintains Buy rating, but lowered price target from $200 to $160. MRVL (Marvell) Downgrade Details: BofA cut price target from $120 to $72, retains Buy rating. Context: Expects Q1 results to beat due to conservative outlooks and tariff-related demand pull-ins. However, tariffs pose risks: Modest tariffs: 4%-6% sales hit, 12%-13% EPS hit. Deeper tariffs: 9% and 12% sales decline in 2025 and 2026, respectively. Reason: Lowered targets across semis coverage due to growing tariff uncertainty. TSLA (Tesla) Downgrade Details: Piper Sandler reduced price target from $450 to $400, maintains Overweight rating. Reason: Q1 deliveries (337,000 units) missed consensus, likely pushing gross margins to multi-year lows. Lack of clarity on Model 2 specs/pricing hinders reliance on new products for growth. Outlook: Short-term bearish due to weak Q1 financials, but &#8220;big picture&#8221; catalysts could drive sharp rallies. Estimates cut to reflect challenging near-term outlook. The semiconductor sector’s woes are hammering tech ETFs, with funds heavy in Nvidia and other chipmakers leading the market’s slide. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), packed with names like Nvidia, AMD, and ASML, cratered over 3.75% after the U.S. tightened export controls on AI chips to China. Nvidia, the ETF’s top holding, warned of a $5.5 billion charge as its H20 processors now require export licenses. The restrictions also hit AMD as the company export controls to apply to MI308 products, resulting in $800 million. Both stocks plunging close to 6% so far today. ASML, a key supplier of chip-making equipment, sank 5.75% after dismal order numbers and tariff warnings.

Ever since President Donald Trump announced his policy of reciprocal tariffs to level the international trade playing field, the stock and bond markets have both become cyclonic in their volatility. 2,000+ point intraday swings in either direction on the Dow Jones Average and a 50 basis point swing for the 10-year Treasury Bond yield in less than a month have given even veteran investors bouts of nausea. As a result, investors from all levels of experience are looking at their portfolios and considering reassessment of their holdings, at least to better handle the current volatility and to reduce the sleepless nights of worry. Key Points The current turbulence in the stock markets are giving both novice and seasoned investors some cause for reconsidering their portfolio compositions. ETFs like SCHD have aspects like dividend focus, which may make them less volatile than ones like VOO, which exclusively tracks the S&amp;P 500 Index. People who are new to investing can find the gigantic menu of choices overwhelming and intimidating, so knowing one’s own goals and risk tolerance before selecting an investment vehicle is a prudent rule of thumb to follow.

A relatively new investor with $3,000 to invest was seeking vehicle suggestions, and posted a question on Reddit. He was considering the following, but was open to any other suggestions: He was considering investing in the Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF (NYSE: SCHD) based on what he’d read from other posts. The poster was looking to contribute $100 per week to take advantage of compounding and dollar cost averaging. Admittedly young and inexperienced, he did understand how investing for the long-term was to his advantage, so he was not seeking quick, short-term gains. He was concerned with putting all of his cookies in a single basket, so was inquiring about opinions on diversifying an allocation into the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSE: VOO). To his credit, the poster realizes now that the Millennial FIRE (Financial Independence Retire Early) meme of “VOO and chill” might not be an appropriate direction to take in the current climate. Nevertheless, he acknowledges the long-term track record of the S&amp;P 500 and how it has benefited millions who have contributed to it regularly and let it compound to build wealth. As the poster has already established long term goals, assessing risk tolerance is probably the next factor to identify before finalizing his course of action. Taking a closer look at SCHD and VOO is probably a prudent step to accomplish this step. (All market quote details are as of the time of this writing.)

As one might expect, a number of the respondents agreed that some diversification was a good idea, as was the plan to invest a new contribution every week. Some of the the specifics included: Due to his youth, some suggested that it would behoove the poster to focus more on growth, and suggested SCHG (Schwab Large Cap Growth ETF), which has a superior ROI history over SCHD. In either case, reinvesting dividends to leverage compounding over the long haul was advised. Some lauded the dividend consideration, since the extra income could serve as a safety net in the event that the poster’s job were to be in jeopardy in the future. Another respondent agreed with adding VOO, but also including an ETF for international exposure so that in the event of a US economic downturn, there would be non-US holdings that could potentially offset any bearishness from the other holdings.

The Nasdaq traded at 5,048 in March 2000. It took 15 years to regain that level after a collapse. That year&#8217;s drop hammered it to 1,114 in October, a 78% drop. When it peaked that March, it had risen by 800% in the previous five years. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: The stock market could drop by more than half Worry about inflation and AI valuations. Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) A similar drop in the value of the Nasdaq today would take it from its 20,0000 peak two months ago to 5,400. It seems impossible, but is it? A few of the largest cap stocks in the world have had huge runups in the last five years. Nvidia has risen 1,433%, and several other Magnificent Seven stocks have almost tripled. The cause of the Nasdaq&#8217;s collapse today would be very different from that of 2000. Hundreds of companies that went public a quarter of a century ago were losing money. When the capital available to them dried up, the shares of most collapsed, and some went out of business. Even companies with strong prospects, like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), took share price beatings. Three factors would cause a deep drop in the market. The first is that the market is considered rich on multiple levels. The S&amp;P 500 PE is 26, which is high unless this year’s earnings are strong across the market. Two other things could crush the market. The first is hyperinflation, which tariffs, the equivalent of a tax on everything from cars to toys, would bring on. American household income will be unable to keep up with double-digit price surges. True hyperinflation occurs when prices go up 50%. Inflation hit the U.S. by 18% in 1980, driven to some extent by energy prices. The Fed raised rates to 19%. The economy was pounded into a recession from 1980 to 1982, and the stock market took a brutal beating. The other significant risk is an AI valuation implosion. Big tech shareholders already worry that the industry has invested more money in AI than it can get as a return on investment in the next few years. Companies have already prepared to invest tens of billions of dollars in server farms to expand because the US does not have that supply today. They have also invested or plan to put billions of dollars into Nvidia&#8217;s (NASDAQ: NVDA) chips. Nvidia&#8217;s value relies on that continuing. The more dangerous and harder-to-forecast problem is that AI could begin to threaten humans. It is not an edge case. Wide-regarded Scientific American recently wrote, “Artificial intelligence algorithms will soon reach a point of rapid self-improvement that threatens our ability to control them and poses great potential risk to humanity.” From an investor’s standpoint, AI could lose most, if not all, of its value, under those circumstances. It is hard to believe that the stock market could lose all of its value, but not that many decades ago, it did.

Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Markets Recover 4:05 pm by Gerelyn Terzo Talk about a roller coaster. After spiraling by over 600 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished in the green, while the S&amp;P 500 similarly eked out a modest gain. The Nasdaq Composite finished slightly lower, but far from its worst levels of the day. While recession fears have been stoked now that the economy is officially slowing down, the markets shook it off, perhaps in anticipation of Meta (Nasdaq: META) and Microsoft&#8217;s (Nasdaq: MSFT) earnings this afternoon. Stocks Trim Losses 12:19 pm by Gerelyn Terzo President Trump has attributed the unexpected GDP contraction to the Biden Administration, surmising that economic growth will &#8220;take a while.&#8221; In the meantime, he urges Americans to stay patient as the next economic boom awaits. Stocks have trimmed their losses. NVDA a Sell 12:07 pm by Gerelyn Terzo One Wall Street firm has turned cautious on the AI boom. Seaport Research has reportedly downgraded shares of AI darling Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) to a &#8220;sell&#8221; rating, owing to worries about AI spending from businesses. Analyst Jay Goldberg believes that while Nvidia was a clear winner in the AI mania, the prospects are already built into the stock. Nvidia stock has shaved off 20% of its value year-to-date. The stock market has come off its lows of the day, with the Nasdaq Composite trimming its declines from approximately 3% to 1% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 are down fractionally. Today&#8217;s sell-off was sparked by an economic contraction in Q1, thrusting the possibility of a recession further into the spotlight. Markets Off Worst Levels 10:53 am by Gerelyn Terzo In what is shaping up to be an historic market sell-off, stocks have come off their worst levels of the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has trimmed its losses from over 600 points to about 400 points, while the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 are down by barely 2% each. In addition to the GDP shocker, the markets received more economic data to process from the labor market. Private payrolls rose by 62,000 in April, falling short of Dow Jones expectations for nearly double that growth. March saw a gain of 147,000 private payrolls, making the sting even worse. Companies are placing hiring on hold as they await the full impact of the Trump administration&#8217;s tariffs. Stock Market Drawdown 10:08 am by Gerelyn Terzo According to Goldman Sachs, if the economy were to slip into a recession, the stock market selling would intensify. Goldman Sachs Micro Strategist Vicky Chang warned that unlike past market cycles, this time around, headline risk signals the market bottom, not the economic trough, saying, &#8220;We still think there is significant vulnerability in a recession scenario, even if the worst of the underlying ‘shock’ has passed.&#8221; The economic slowdown is real. The U.S. economy contracted by 0.3% during Q1 2025 after corporate America rushed to receive imports before the tariffs kicked in. According to the Commerce Department, U.S. GDP declined at an annual rate of 0.3%, adjusted for inflation, the worst drop the economy has suffered in in three years. By way of comparison, economists were predicting an economic expansion of 0.4% in the first quarter, a far cry from the results as the tariff wars took hold. Stocks went into freefall mode in response, including a 600-point decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite spiraled by 2.7% and the S&amp;P 5oo lost 2.0%. Every single sector of the economy is trading lower as fears of an economic recession grip the markets. Each of the Magnificent Seven stocks are under pressure, including a steep 6% drop in Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) and declines of close to 4% for Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) and Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN). What a day for Meta Platforms (Nasdaq: META) to be reporting quarterly earnings after the closing bell today. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 646.83 (-1.6%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 454.57 (-2.6%) S&amp;P 500: Down 111.05 (-1.9%) Market Movers Starbucks (Nasdaq: SBUX) is losing 8% on the day and has been downgraded by Goldman Sachs to a &#8220;neutral&#8221; rating from &#8220;&#8216;buy&#8221; with a $85 price target attached, down from a previous target of over $100 per share. Starbucks reported Q1 results and missed Wall Street estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Social media platform Snap (NYSE: SNAP) is falling by over 15% this morning in the market sell-off after choosing to forego earnings guidance due to uncertainty from tariffs. First Solar (Nasdaq: FSLR) is losing 10% on the day after missing Q1 estimates and revealing the toll that tariffs will take on its revenue in 2025.

Dividend investing may be more favored by older investors who value passive income over growth and capital appreciation. However, investing in dividend payers can be a wise move, regardless of one&#8217;s age. Arguably, it&#8217;s better to go for the proven blue chips with dividends as a beginning investor than jump into the deep end with incredibly volatile but exciting growth stocks. When it comes to hot growth stocks, the stakes are higher, and a new investor may be more inclined to &#8220;chase&#8221; momentum and be startled out of a position when such momentum reverses. In any case, there&#8217;s really no right age to take on more of a dividend strategy. Ultimately, it depends on one&#8217;s needs, goals, and tolerance for risk. Most young people should be in growth mode as they look to maximize the appreciation of their nest eggs. And while dividends can be a nice-to-have for such new, young investors, it&#8217;s worth noting that a dividend strategy isn&#8217;t always the most tax-efficient way to go. Additionally, a dividend-focused strategy is not a proven way to beat the markets consistently over the long haul. A t the end of the day, more money paid out in dividends means less for a company to reinvest into its growth drivers. Often, lower growth means higher dividend yields, and vice versa. Though some exceptions can be made during the depths of a stock market correction or crash. In this piece, we&#8217;ll look at common approaches among investors in different age groups to help readers better find the right allocation. Key Points Younger investors should favor growth over yield while gradually transitioning as they age and their passive income needs grow. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Younger investors: Go for growth Young investors in their 20s and 30s should seek to have a heavier allocation towards the types of growth stocks that have little (or no) dividends. Indeed, we&#8217;re talking about yields south of the 1% mark. And while a few extra dollars in dividend income are nice to have, one must remember that any such dividends should be reinvested anyhow to jolt one&#8217;s growth. In any case, I think it makes less sense to have more than 25% of one&#8217;s equity portfolio in high-yielding dividend stocks unless there&#8217;s some specific passive income need that needs to be met. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which yields 0.84%, stands out as a perfect holding for a younger investor who prioritizes capital gains over dividends. And while the yield is quite small, I am a fan of the dividend growth trajectory as the company executes on the AI boom. With around 30% of code reportedly now generated by AI, at least according to CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft seems to have the perfect AI flywheel that could power it to robust gains over the long haul. Middle-aged investors: Go for dividend growth For someone in middle age, opting for a dividend and growth mix seems to make the most sense. Whether that entails 50% in dividend stocks and 50% in higher-growth names, finding the right balance as one begins the process of winding down in their 40s and 50s for a potentially early retirement could prove wise. Additionally, dividend-growth stocks that have a long history of raising dividends by double-digit percentage amounts in any given year could be an excellent choice. For instance, shares of the Home Depot (NYSE:HD) stand out as a stellar option, given its robust dividend and respectable growth profile. The home improvement firm has a wide moat surrounding its corner of the market, which has allowed it to average around 15% in dividend growth over the past five years. With a solid 2.56% dividend yield and above-average dividend growth prospects, HD stock stands out as a perfect bet for dividend investors in their 40s or 50s. Retirement age: Doubling down on passive income Finally, someone in retirement may wish to go heavier on the dividend stocks. While it may still be hard to live off dividends alone, I do think that those with enough passive income streams (think pensions, Social Security, etc) may have the opportunity to minimize the withdrawal from their invested principal. For such income-focused retirees, the iShares International Select Dividend ETF (IDV) stands out, with a nice 5.6% yield and broad exposure to the developed international markets beyond the U.S. Also, as the tariff war continues, the international financial markets may not have as much downside risk as the S&amp;P 500.

Dividend stock investing offers a reliable path to passive income and long-term wealth creation, making it a cornerstone for many portfolios. By owning shares in companies that pay regular dividends, investors gain consistent cash flow, often from stable, high-quality firms like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) or Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). Dividends provide a hedge against market volatility, as payouts persist even during downturns, and reinvesting them can compound returns significantly over time. Moreover, dividend-paying stocks historically outperform non-dividend peers, with lower volatility. 24/7 Wall St. Insights: Dividend stock investing has proven a reliable path for investors to gather immense wealth over time. Dividend ETFs bolster those results by investing in hundreds of dividend-paying stocks, offering instant diversification and minimizing single-stock risk. Sit back and let dividends do the heavy lifting for a simple, steady path to serious wealth creation over time. Grab a free copy of “2 Legendary High-Yield Dividend Stocks“ now. Dividend-paying exchange-traded funds (ETFs) enhance these benefits by pooling dozens or hundreds of such stocks, offering instant diversification, reduced single-stock risk, and low expense ratios. In 2025’s uncertain market, marked by tariffs and persistent inflation, dividend ETFs provide resilience and income stability. Pursuing this strategy ensures steady returns and growth, making it ideal for both novice and seasoned investors seeking financial security.

The ETF&#8217;s 3.7% yield and ultra-low 0.06% expense ratio make it cost-effective while limiting sector exposure to no more than 25% ensures diversification. SCHD’s 11.4% annualized return over a decade reflects its balance of income and growth. Because SCHD focuses on financially sound companies, the dividend ETF mitigates risks, offering investors stability. For those seeking high yield and reliability, SCHD stock is a must-own ETF for lifelong passive income.

The stock market had a 20% reset in April, which lasted only a few days, if even that. Recently, it has traded down only 7% for the year. It has only been a quarter of a century since the last market wipeout. The Nasdaq dropped 75% from March 2000 to October 2002. Most of the reason was the .com companies had raised too much money as their losses mounted, and the value of their business models was viewed as unsustainable. Key Points The Market Could Drop 50% Trillions Of Dollars Would Disappear Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) The most notable part of the market crash was that it destroyed company stocks with strong business models that are today&#8217;s market titans, including Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). When the market imploded, Microsoft’s market cap dropped 65%. If the market dropped 75% today, the Nasdaq would collapse from 17,100 to 4,475, and its market value would collapse by $23 trillion, hammering the wealth of many Americans. It is worth noting that the 2000 to 2022 Nasdaq market collapse was not accompanied by a significant recession. GDP fell only .3% in that period, and unemployment rose to 5.5%. That is hardly a recession at all. One of the first signs of a new, sharp market drop is that stocks in the AI craze have started to crater. AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), considered the No. 2 AI chip maker, traded at $227 in March last year. A few weeks ago, it dropped to $88 and has since recovered to $102. Palantir (NASDAQ: PLTR) reached $125 in February last year. It dropped to $74 early last month, a 40% drop. It recently moved up to $117. What is critical about Palantir and AMD is that they are remarkably healthy companies with growing revenue and what appear to be successful models, unlike the .com companies of 2000 and 2002. Nevertheless, their shares collapsed. If there is a massive market sell-off, it would happen for one of two reasons. The first is that the huge bet on AI falters. It could. Companies could get “out over their skis.” Meta (NASDAQ: META) says it will invest $50 billion to $75 billion in AI this year. Microsoft has pegged its investment at $80 billion for the same period. AI is supposed to change the world. Many public companies with prospects driven by AI investments are supposed to have tremendous revenue growth unless they don’t. The other threat to the market is hyperinflation. Inflation rose to 14% in 1979. If there is a similar problem this year, it will be because of tariffs, which could be as high as 100% on Chinese goods. The inflationary problem would ripple across the US economy in months. Sixty percent of US adults own stocks. That statistic says everything.

Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended The Magnificent 7 Could See Even More Upside 11:38 am While today’s 1,000-point Dow rally has been impressive, similar days may be ahead. When the U.S. and China meet again in the next few weeks, they’ll work out a bigger agreement on trade. While nothing has been set in stone with that just yet, markets are still celebrating today’s trade breakthrough. Here’s where that currently stands. Under the 90-day pause, both countries lowered tariffs by 115 percentage points to 10%. The 20% fentanyl-related tariff from the U.S. remains in place, so most Chinese goods face a 30% rate in total, down from 145% previously, as noted by CNBC. The Magnificent 7 Are Just Starting to Rally Back 10:50 am As of May, the Magnificent 7 lost about $6 trillion in value since their peak in late 2024. Also, at its trough, the Roundhill BIG Tech ETF (NASDAQ: MAGS) – which tracks the Magnificent 7 plummeted from about $56 to a low of $39. However, thanks to the latest U.S.-China news, the ETF is quickly rebounding higher. Making the Mag 7 even more attractive, analysts believe they can easily beat the S&amp;P 500 in earnings this year. Plus, with valuations off their 2024 peaks, investors are coming back to the table to feast. The U.S. and China have finally agreed to a temporary – but significant easing of tariffs. In fact, according to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, U.S. tariffs on China will drop 115 percentage points to 30%. China’s levies on U.S. imports will drop to 10%. More information on specifics can be found in the Joint Statement on U.S. China Economic and Trade Meeting in Geneva at WhiteHouse.gov. As a result of the agreement, the Dow Jones is up about 1,050 points. The NASDAQ is up 663, as the S&amp;P 500 adds 156 points. Even better, it’s boosting the Magnificent 7 stocks. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is up 5.6%, or $11.25. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is up 1%, or by $4.80. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) is up about 3%, or by $4.71. com (NASDAQ: AMZN) is up 7.4% or by $14.55. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is up 4%, or by $4.80. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) I up 6.5%, or by $38.73. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) is up 7%, or by $21.23.

For prospective heirs of a modest four-figure inheritance, it&#8217;s worth considering the wide range of uses for the sum. Of course, saving and investing the sum in the S&amp;P 500 would be a top choice for many. For others, using the amount as part of a down payment on a home would be a top choice. And, of course, for others looking to adapt their skillset for the artificial intelligence (AI) age, it&#8217;s all about investing in oneself to reskill ahead of the so-called fourth industrial revolution. In any case, let&#8217;s dig deeper into the case involving a 30-something who&#8217;s thinking deeply about where to put their coming windfall to work. From college, retirement, to a future home and experiences, let&#8217;s find out which expenditure would offer more bang for the buck. Key Points This Reddit user is weighing how to put their coming $80k inheritance to work. Should retirement, college, or something else take precedence? Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Option #1: Investing for retirement First up, we have good, old-fashioned investing for retirement. When in doubt, this is certainly never a bad idea, especially for those who are a bit behind when it comes to retirement milestones. For those who haven&#8217;t made good use of their tax-advantaged accounts, I&#8217;d suggest contributing and investing the proceeds in a run-of-the-mill S&amp;P 500 index fund with a low gross expense ratio. Vanguard and iShares boast the lowest fees out there with some of the most impressive liquidity, making them top picks for passive investors looking to invest their windfall wisely. Of course, there are active mutual funds that may claim to have a market-beating edge. But if you&#8217;re going to sacrifice 2% on what could be a long shot, I&#8217;d much rather go down the route of a passive investor with an S&amp;P 500 index fund or pick up shares of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B), which has some brilliant minds deploying capital without a hefty expense ratio commanded by most actively-managed mutual funds. Whether you&#8217;re a big fan of Warren Buffett, his successor Greg Abel, or the other smart folks (Ajit Jain, Ted Weschler, and Todd Combs), you&#8217;re getting a star-studded lineup for a fairly low price of admission, at least in my opinion. Whether you choose ETFs, Berkshire Hathaway, or some other investment vehicle, putting an inheritance towards retirement is a wise move that&#8217;s sure to pay dividends (unless, of course, you&#8217;re going all-in on Berkshire!). Option #2: Investing in college What&#8217;s better than investing in your retirement? Investing in yourself. Warren Buffett thinks it&#8217;s the best thing you can do. It can&#8217;t be taxed or taken away from you, and it may very well score you the best returns in life. Of course, not all college degrees and diplomas will score you a high-paying job, especially as the disruptive aura of AI approaches. In any case, I&#8217;d be cognizant of AI and strive to pursue a career that can stand tall, even as the threat of automation rises. With Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) recently laying off 6,000, questions linger as to what the future holds for a wide range of professions, from coding to management. In any case, investing in college is a fantastic way to go, especially for those who aren&#8217;t content with their current careers. Additionally, upskilling, online certificates, and lighter-weight options should also be considered depending on one&#8217;s goals. Option #3: Down payment on a home Indeed, $80,000 isn&#8217;t quite enough for a home, but it can be enough for a down payment on a modest home. Of course, there is a degree of risk in taking out leverage, especially if one&#8217;s considering going back to college. Add the uncertainty of AI-induced automation into the equation, and a mortgage seems like it&#8217;d be riskier going into the 2030s, given that the stability of many forms of employment could come into question as AI moves at a blistering pace. Option #4: Family fund for experiences Finally, for someone who doesn&#8217;t really need the cash, given they&#8217;re already financially ahead, spending down a big chunk of the sum isn&#8217;t the worst idea in the world. Of course, for frequent travellers seeking to get more mileage, a $80,000 vacation fund could be created so that one would be able to have enough to fund occasional trips in perpetuity. Based on the &#8220;4% rule,&#8221; one could draw down 4% per year (works out to $3,200 in this case) of the inheritance and have enough for a sweet trip every single year. Of course, between college and a vacation fund, I&#8217;d go with the former, especially since AI demands upskilling and adapting to the new breadth of careers that didn&#8217;t exist a decade ago, that will come to be.

Key Points The QDVO ETF offers a high annual yield and exposure to famous large-cap stocks. Meanwhile, the RSPA ETF is widely diversified but also pays big dividends. It’s hard to believe, but today there are credit cards offering up to 6% cash back, $200 statement credits, $0 annual fees, travel rewards, and more. See for yourself, I couldn’t believe it at first. Frankly, with rewards this good we don’t expect them to be available forever. But if you sign up today you can secure some of the best rewards we’ve ever seen. Click here to get started. If you&#8217;ve managed to save up $500,000 to invest in stocks and exchange traded funds (ETFs), pat yourself on the back. You&#8217;re in a great position to earn tens of thousands of dollars in worry-free income each and every year. Two passive income powerhouses are particularly well-suited for investors seeking relatively safe dividends/distributions. With these two high-yield funds, you could generate $40,000 per year from a half-a-million-dollar account. So, let&#8217;s look at a pair of ETFs that could help you grow your fortune while you sleep soundly at night. QDVO: Tech Exposure, Decent Diversification It might sound risky to take $500,000 and equally divide it among just two funds. However, this plan can make sense if the two funds provide good diversification across well-known stocks. The first ETF that fits this description is the Amplify CWP Growth &amp; Income ETF (NYSEARCA:QDVO). This ETF generates income from dividends and premium payments from writing/selling call options. Since the Amplify CWP Growth &amp; Income ETF includes 42 stocks in its holdings, you&#8217;ll achieve diversification with just this one fund. Plus, you&#8217;ll get portfolio exposure to highly established technology giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). While the Amplify CWP Growth &amp; Income ETF emphasizes large-cap technology stocks, it also includes non-tech names such as Visa (NYSE:V), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), and RTX/Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX). Consequently, your $500,000 portfolio won&#8217;t be too tech-heavy with the QDVO ETF. An added bonus of the Amplify CWP Growth &amp; Income ETF is that it pays out its dividends/distributions on a monthly basis. Hence, there&#8217;s no need to wait three full months to start seeing the cash show up in your account. Getting down to the nitty-gritty, the Amplify CWP Growth &amp; Income ETF offers an annual distribution rate of 9.87%, but also deducts 0.55% worth of operating expenses. This means that QDVO&#8217;s expected annualized net yield for investors would be 9.87% &#8211; 0.55%, or 9.32%. RSPA: High Yield, Hundreds of Famous Names Even though the the Amplify CWP Growth &amp; Income ETF has plenty of benefits, you don&#8217;t have to pour an entire $500,000 account into one fund. Instead, you could allocate $250,000 toward QDVO and the remaining $250,000 into the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF (NYSEARCA:RSPA). Generally based on the S&amp;P 500 index, the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF has 524 stocks in its holdings. Moreover, it&#8217;s not too heavily allocated toward technology or any other sector, as the RSPA ETF places roughly equal weighting on each stock. Within the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF you&#8217;ll find technology luminaries like Microsoft, Apple, and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU). Yet, you&#8217;ll also discover non-technology-focused firms such as PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). Hence, you can massively diversify your portfolio with the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF and sleep all night long worry-free. Furthermore, there&#8217;s an added benefit with this fund because, like QDVO, RSPA pays out its distributions every month. The annual distribution rate for the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF is 9.13%, which is quite impressive. When we subtract the operating fees of 0.29% per year, the RSPA ETF should provide an expected net annual yield of 9.13% &#8211; 0.29%, or 8.84%. Getting $40,000 Each Year From Two ETFs Now, let&#8217;s do the math with these two terrific funds. For extra-wide diversification, you could put $250,000 into the Amplify CWP Growth &amp; Income ETF and another $250,000 into the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF. Then, your average expected net annual yield would be (9.32% + 8.84%) / 2, or 9.08%. Actually, your yield could be even higher if you reinvest the cash distributions every month, but let&#8217;s keep it simple and assume a 9.08% yield for now. After one year, assuming the two funds don&#8217;t reduce their distribution rates, you could expect to receive cash distributions totaling $500,000 x 9.08%, or $45,400. This allows some room for error, as it easily beats your goal of earning $40,000 in dividends/distributions. Of course, you should monitor the share prices of the two ETFs and not only the distribution rates. After all, you&#8217;ll want to see some share-price appreciation to further build your $500,000 nest egg.

Here’s the Smartest Way to Turn It Into Monthly Passive Income","Inherited $400,000? Here’s the Smartest Way to Turn It Into Monthly Passive Income
Key Points The SPHD and DIVO ETFs are ideal vehicles for volatility mitigation and reliable income. Furthermore, you can enhance your monthly income potential with single-stock ETFs. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) If you&#8217;re fortunate enough to inherit $400,000, it may be tempting to spend that money on cars and vacations. However, the smart-money move is to invest the funds wisely and plan for your financial future. One approach is to invest that $400,000 in exchange traded funds (ETFs) that provide passive income every month. That way, you can reinvest the cash distributions and take advantage of the compounding effect. So now, it&#8217;s time to reveal four funds that unlock monthly income opportunities so you can turn your inheritance into a cash-producing machine. SPHD: A Reliable Pick for Low Volatility $400,000 is a whole lot of money to inherit and invest. Therefore, your first priority shouldn&#8217;t be maximizing your monthly dividends. Instead, it should be mitigating your risk so you don&#8217;t lose all of that money. When safety and reliability are your top priorities, the Invesco S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility ETF (NYSEARCA:SPHD) is a solid pick. This fund has 52 stocks in its holdings, all carefully selected from the S&amp;P 500 large-cap stock index. The SPHD ETF specifically chooses stocks &#8220;that historically have provided high dividend yields and low volatility.&#8221; Examples include Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), Realty Income Corp. (NYSE:O), Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), and Altria Group (NYSE:MO). These companies are known for providing consistent dividend payments, and their stocks typically aren&#8217;t volatile. Furthermore, the Invesco S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility ETF features a 12-month distribution rate (i.e., a forward annual dividend yield) of 3.44%. Plus, the SPHD ETF pays out its distributions on a monthly basis. With all of that in mind, you could take $150,000 of your inherited $400,000, put it into the Invesco S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility ETF, and sleep soundly at night. Stay in the Safe Lane With DIVO With $400,000 to invest, you&#8217;ll have a large account and there&#8217;s no need to drive in the fast lane. Instead, you can stay in the &#8220;safe lane&#8221; but still get a passive income stream with the Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF (NYSEARCA:DIVO). Much like the SPHD ETF, the Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF seeks to reduce share-price volatility while providing exposure to high-quality dividend-paying companies. Moreover, like the other funds mentioned today, DIVO puts cash distributions into your account on a monthly basis. The Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF has 24 stocks in its holdings, and you&#8217;ll see plenty of large-cap sector leaders in there. Among the top holdings in the DIVO ETF are Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), RTX/Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), Visa (NYSE:V), and Home Depot (NYSE:HD). Again, we&#8217;re choosing safety first and then aiming for good yield. Since the Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF invests in great companies and features an impressive 4.73% annual distribution rate, it checks all the right boxes. Thus, it would make sense to allocate $150,000 of a $400,000 inheritance toward the DIVO ETF. Accelerate Your Yield With Single-Stock ETFs It&#8217;s wise to dedicate $300,000 of your $400,000 inheritance toward diversified low-volatility funds like SPHD and DIVO. If you do that, then you can invest the remaining $100,000 in ETFs with greater risk but also higher yields. To that end, YieldMax offers a wide variety of ETFs that each focus on a single stock instead of a diversified basket of stocks. Typically, these YieldMax ETFs derive monthly income from U.S. Treasury bonds and sophisticated options-trading strategies. One way to reduce the risk is to stick to YieldMax ETFs that focus on established large-cap companies. For example, the YieldMax AAPL Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:APLY) indirectly derives income from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock. Currently, the APLY ETF advertises an annual distribution rate of 26.99%. This fund shouldn&#8217;t be excessively risky as Apple is a reliable blue-chip business with staying power. So, you could invest $25,000 of your $400,000 inheritance in the YieldMax AAPL Option Income Strategy ETF. A reasonable plan would be to pick four single-stock ETFs with a focus on high-confidence companies. Then, you could allocate $25,000 toward each of the four funds you picked. A Mixed-Risk Approach APLY is just one example of many monthly-paying single-stock ETFs you can choose from. Here&#8217;s a summary of other funds in this category, and while you explore them, you might think about picking your four favorites: The YieldMax AMZN Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:AMZY); based on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock; 47.82% annual distribution rate The YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:NVDY); based on NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock; 74.99% annual distribution rate The YieldMax GOOGL Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:GOOY); based on the stock of Google parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL); 32.9% annual distribution rate The YieldMax MSFT Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:MSFO); based on Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock; 34.9% annual distribution rate The YieldMax JPM Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:JPMO); based on JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) stock; 39% annual distribution rate The YieldMax AMD Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:AMDY); based on Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock; 68.07% annual distribution rate The YieldMax DIS Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:DISO); based on Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) stock; 38.55% annual distribution rate The YieldMax XOM Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:XOMO); based on Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) stock; 38.04% annual distribution rate Just to provide an idea of what your overall plan might look like, you could invest $150,000 in SPHD, $150,000 in DIVO, and $25,000 each in APLY, MSFO, DISO, and XOMO. All in all, you can mix low-risk ETFs with a handful of higher-risk ETFs to turn your inherited $400,000 into a fairly reliable monthly income-producing machine.The post Inherited $400,000?

Shares of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) gained 1.84% over the past five trading sessions, bringing the Magnificent Seven stock&#8217;s one-month gain to 6.06% and its year-to-date gain to 21.12%. In July, Piper Sandler raised the firm&#8217;s price target for MSFT to $600 from $475 while keeping its &#8220;Overweight&#8221; rating. The firm highlighted Microsoft&#8217;s bullish spending backdrop for AI infrastructure. Specifically, Piper Sandler noted that Azure spending intentions surpassed 80% for the first time, retaining the top role as the cloud and AI infrastructure platform of choice. On June 5, it was reported that the company will be expanding its AI and cloud investments in Switzerland, committing $400 million to expand its data center infrastructure in the European nation. The additional capacity is expected to support more than 50,000 current customers and expand the availability of AI services for more sectors, including health care, finance government. Microsoft is capitalizing on its Azure platform’s momentum as revenue jumped 33% in FY25 Q3, driven by AI services. When the company last reported earnings, it announced that total revenue rose 13% to $70.1 billion and it generated earnings of $3.46 per share, beating estimates of $3.22 per share. Despite a $800 million charge last quarter from its investment in General Motors&#8216; (NYSE:GM) Cruise robotaxi initiative that the automaker subsequently shutdown, Microsoft’s focus on AI and cloud resilience continues to fuel optimism. However, its decision earlier in May fire 6,000 employees — or 3% of its workforce — signals the tech giant is serious about cost discipline amid economic uncertainty. With analysts eyeing sustained cloud demand, 24/7 Wall St. conducted analysis to explore whether Microsoft can maintain its upward trajectory and drive long-term growth. Key Points in This Article: Microsoft is dedicating significant capex to AI and cloud infrastructure in order to compete with other tech firms. Microsoft’s gaming segment grew 44% last year, providing significant revenue to complement its software, cloud and AI business lines. If you’re looking for an AI stock early in the AI growth cycle, grab a complimentary copy of our “The Next NVIDIA” report. It has a software stock that could ride dominance in AI to returns of 10x or more. Why Invest in Microsoft Microsoft navigates challenges, but remains a prime investment due to its AI and cloud dominance. Third-quarter earnings showcased robust demand for its Intelligent Cloud segment, though tariff risks linger. Microsoft’s $80 billion cash reserve fuels its $80 billion investments in cloud and AI infrastructure, with over half in the U.S. Its Microsoft 365 Copilot, adopted by over 70% of Fortune 500 firms, drives productivity revenue, positioning Microsoft to capture the AI market’s 37% compounded annual growth predicted through 2030. Similarly, partnerships with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) for multi-cloud solutions bolster its competitiveness against Amazon&#8216;s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS. When Microsoft last reported earnings, EPS beat by 7.40% and revenue beat by 2.37%. The EPS beat marked the 15th time in the past 16 quarters that the company surpassed estimates, with EPS coming in at $3.46 versus the consensus forecast of $3.20. Microsoft (MSFT) As a Company Microsoft reported a gross profit of $49.8 billion, up 14% year-over-year, with gross margins at 68%, driven by strong cloud and AI demand. The company committed to continuing spending on capital expenditures, focusing on AI data center expansion to meet enterprise needs. Analysts expect Q4 capex to remain elevated at $16 billion to $17 billion to support Microsoft’s cloud infrastructure growth. Tariff uncertainties do pose risks, even with the pause on China, as supply chain cost pressures for server hardware are not eliminated. Microsoft’s operating income of $32 billion was tempered by a 5% rise in operating expenses, reflecting heavy AI R&amp;D investments. Despite no revenue from its $13 billion OpenAI stake, Microsoft reported $42.4 billion in Microsoft Cloud revenue, up 20% year-over-year. Beyond cloud, Microsoft’s gaming segment grew 44% with 43 points of the gain coming from its acquisition of Activision, but bolstered by Xbox content and Bethesda’s Starfield expansion. A partnership with Oracle for multicloud solutions strengthens its enterprise offerings, further diversifying its revenue. Wall Street projects Q4 revenue of $73.8 billion, up 14%, driven by Microsoft&#8217;s AI and cloud momentum. Microsoft As a Stock Earlier in June, Citi raised its price target for MSFT to $605 from $540 while maintaining its &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating. The firm also added an &#8220;upside 90-day catalyst watch&#8221; on the shares. Citi says Microsoft remains its top pick in software given the company&#8217;s &#8220;relative defensiveness in a choppy macro environment,&#8221; AI product cycle and &#8220;reinforced conviction&#8221; that Street estimates on Azure may be too low for fiscal 2026. The firm believes the share catalyst will be fiscal Q4 earnings when fiscal 2026 guidance is announced and beyond as both Microsoft and OpenAI AI revenue continue to ramp. Citi says Azure has &#8220;hit an inflection&#8221; based on its exit rate math and token usage. In late June, Wedbush raised its price target on Microsoft to $600 from $515, maintaining its &#8220;Outperform&#8221; rating. The firm is &#8220;incrementally bullish&#8221; on Microsoft following recent AI customer checks in the field. Wedbush says a &#8220;massive adoption wave of Copilot and Azure monetization now on the doorstep&#8221; for the company. Similarly, Morgan Stanley recently raised its price target on Microsoft to $530 from $482, maintaining its &#8220;Overweight&#8221; rating on the shares after the firm updated its capex-implied AI revenue analysis and its OpenAI model detailing the contribution to Azure. Broadly, Wall Street analysts&#8217; remain bullish, with 32 of 35 analysts covering MSFT assigning it a &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating, three assigning it a &#8220;Hold&#8221; rating and zero assigning it a &#8220;Sell&#8221; rating. Overall, the stock receives a consensus &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; rating. Wall Street&#8217;s price targets cover a significant range, spanning $475 per share on the low end to $605 per share on the high end. The median one-year price target for MSFT is $528.35, which represents 4.93% potential upside from today&#8217;s share price. Institutional ownership currently stands at 73.03%, with three of the four largest buy-side firms — Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street — holding a collective 1.570 billion shares of Microsoft. Estimate Price Target %Change From Current Price Low $475 -6.31% Median $535.87 5.69% High $605 19.32% Microsoft (MSFT) Stock Prediction in 2025 Microsoft’s 33% Azure growth and 20% cloud revenue increase in Q3 position it for AI market gains. However, $20 billion quarterly capex and tariff risks require caution. Its $80 billion cash reserve and Oracle partnership offer stability, making MSFT stock a buy for growth investors, even as valuation concerns linger. 24/7 Wall St.’s price target for Microsoft is $495.00, implying downside potential of 2.36% from the stock&#8217;s current price. This cautious target reflects Azure’s strength and Q4 revenue guidance of $73.7 billion, balanced against the need for higher capex spending and potential supply chain disruptions, positioning it at a realistic estimate of its leading presence in the space.The post Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Stock Price Prediction for 2025: Where Will It Be in 1 Year appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",1131.0,641.0,18.0,9.0,15.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,0.028081123244929798,0.014040561622464899,0.0234009360374415,0.0015600624024961,0.0046801872074883,0.014040561622464899

Shares of Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) gained 0.57% over the past five trading sessions, bringing the e-commerce and cloud storage solutions stock&#8217;s year-to-date gain to 3.24%. Over the past year, it is up 24.54%. On July 8, it was reported that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos sold nearly three million shares worth $665.8 million over two days in July as part of a plan announced earlier in 2025 that will see Bezos unload up to 25 million shares through May 2026. In June and July the stock saw a series of adjusted price targets from analysts. Cantor Fitzgerald raised its price target on AMZN to $260 from $240 while maintaining an &#8220;Overweight&#8221; rating. Truist raised its price target on AMZN to $250 from $226 while maintaining a &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating. Bank of America raised the its price target on AMZN to $248 from $230 while maintaining its &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating. Piper Sandler raised its price target on AMZN to $250 from $212 while maintaining an &#8220;Overweight&#8221; rating. Amazon announced in July that it has deployed its 1 millionth robot while also deploying its new AI foundation model to power its robotic fleet. Its first twelfth generation automated fulfillment center launched in late-2024 and the robots are primarily focused on delivery station efficiencies. The robotics cycle is &#8220;early,&#8221; according to Bank of America&#8217;s analyst, who expects Amazon to leverage robots to reduce labor dependency, increase order accuracy and improve warehouse efficiency, driving material cost savings. In its first-quarter earnings call, Amazon reported that Q1 revenue growth and an operating income increase. Amazon Ads generated $13.9 billion in revenue alone, representing a 19% year-over-year increase, while AWS grew by 17% year-over-year to an annualized revenue run rate of $117 billion. Still, the stock remains down nearly 15% from its all-time high on Feb. 4, with its one-year gain now standing at 15.87%. The company plans to announce Q2 financials on Thursday, Aug. 1. Still, while there can be little doubt about its current financial health, investors and potential investors may be right to wonder whether growth can continue at Amazon&#8217;s historic pace, and whether the stock is safe as a long-term holding. Let&#8217;s take a look at where the share price could be headed. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: Amazon is facing substantial headwinds this year, but the stock remains fundamentally sound with a &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; rating. AWS, AI and ad sales continue to be major drivers for the Magnificent Seven stock.

This report breaks down AI stocks with 10x potential and will give you a huge leg up on profiting from this massive sea change. Why Invest in Amazon? In the past 20 years, Amazon&#8217;s stock is up more than 9,188%. The company has been called one of the most influential economic and cultural forces in the world, and its brand is one of the world&#8217;s most valuable. Though the stock tumbled as the COVID-19 pandemic waned and lockdowns ended (along with the broader markets), it has more than recovered. Shares of this Magnificent Seven member hit an all-time high on Feb. 4, 2025, but with the Nasdaq briefly entering bear market territory in March, it had been downhill for Amazon in 2025. There have been signs of hope recently, with AMZN rebounding along with the broad market. It is hard to imagine that the company or its share price will collapse any time soon, but analysts and investors may see the stock as overbought. Let&#8217;s see what Wall Street expects. Amazon as a Company The company engages in the retail sale of consumer products, advertising, and subscriptions service through online and physical stores internationally. It also manufactures and sells electronic devices and develops and produces media content. Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides compute, storage, database, analytics, machine learning, and other services. And Amazon Prime is the company&#8217;s membership program. Amazon is based in Seattle. It was founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos, the former chief executive officer and now executive board chair. Amazon went public in May 1997. Its retail competitors include Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE:BABA), Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT). It also competes with the likes of Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT). The company continues its push into artificial intelligence with an update of its Alexa feature to Alexa+. AWS investments in cloud computing and AI also continue, with the former being the world&#8217;s largest cloud services provider and the latter nearing its debut of its &#8220;Nova&#8221; chatbot, which will compete in price with ChatGPT. Additionally, Amazon has been expanding its same-day delivery services, and its entertainment division has secured the James Bond franchise with the acquisition of MGM Studios. Headwinds include ongoing labor issues. The most recent quarterly results showed strong performance, with AWS as a major growth driver. Amazon as a Stock Since hitting its all-time high on Feb. 4, the stock has lost nearly 6%. Note that Wall Street analysts&#8217; median price target of $251.44 is above Amazon&#8217;s all-time high share price seen earlier this year. Of the 45 analysts covering AMZN, all but one assign it a &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating, with the other assigning it a &#8220;Hold&#8221; rating. Overall, the stock receives a consensus &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; rating. Loop Capital and Wells Fargo recently reiterated buy-equivalent ratings, and with 65.25% of shares held by institutional investors — including notable stakes from the three largest asset management companies, Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street — the stock is popular among Wall Street&#8217;s sell-side firms. Institutional holdings of Amazon have seen net increase with 2,976 position increases versus 2,361 position decreases. Wall Street expectations for where the stock goes in the next 52 weeks vary. While analysts overall anticipate healthy upside, the lowest price target indicates a decline in the share price. The consensus projection signals strong upside potential for the next 52 weeks, based on strong forward guidance for business segments like AWS and Prime Video&#8217;s ad sales, which saw enormous year-over-year increases as the platform now hosts the NFL&#8217;s Thursday Night Football programming. Estimate Price Target %Change From Current Price Low $195.00 -14.22% Median $250.95 11.83% High $305.00 34.15% Amazon does face some headwinds and risks in addition to those mentioned above. Consumer spending has rebounded in the wake of Trump&#8217;s tariff threats and subsequent pauses, which could help GDP in Q2 after it contracted GDP in Q1, raising the risks of a possible recession in 2025. Over the past three months, the consumer discretionary sector of the S&amp;P 500 — into which Amazon falls — has performed the third best, posting a gain of 19.83%, trailing only technology (35.27%) and industrials (20.88%). While the company dominates in the retail space and is a tech leader, competition in neither category is likely to go away anytime soon. All these things could have a huge impact on profitability. Despite some skeptics, the prospects for Amazon are optimistic overall, especially in the short term. Wall Street&#8217;s &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; consensus rating and the upside potential far outweigh the downside potential shares of AMZN face.

Key Points The RSPA ETF will immediately turn the bulk of your $25,000 account into a diversified income machine. Smaller allocations into SCHD, JEPQ, and FDVV will help you build a low-fee passive income foundation. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) How far can $25,000 get you? If you have a well-considered plan in place, you can actually turn your small account into a passive income factory. This can be done with a carefully selected group of high-yield, low-fee exchange traded funds (ETFs). With just $25,000, you can build a super-low-cost portfolio that consistently pays you cash dividends/distributions. Plus, you can de-risk your portfolio through multi-sector diversification and investment in famous large-cap companies. So, let&#8217;s start right now with a smart-money plan to extract sizable cash payouts from a small but growing account. Start With RSPA for Extra Diversification Out of a $25,000 account, you can confidently put $10,000 into just one ETF. That&#8217;s because the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF (NYSEARCA:RSPA) checks all of the right boxes for a small-sized high-growth portfolio. To populate a small-sized portfolio, I would want to use funds that invest in successful, blue-chip business. I would also insist that the ETFs should be diversified and need to have annual operating expenses below 0.5%. With a focus on companies in the prestigious S&amp;P 500 index, the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF has 525 stocks in its holdings. Suffice it to say, then, that the RSPA ETF is widely diversified. When you examine the fund&#8217;s holdings list, you&#8217;ll find established large-cap leaders across multiple economic sectors. Some examples are Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), and Consolidated Edison (NYSE:ED). An interesting feature of the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF is that each of the holdings has a small, roughly equal weighing to the other stocks in the fund. That way, you won&#8217;t over-invest in any single stock. In addition, the RSPA ETF is low-cost as it only deducts annualized operating fees of 0.29%. And for all of you yield hunters out there, the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF currently features a 12-month distribution rate of 9.42%. All in all, this ultra-diversified fund is ideal for a $25,000 account and I would feel comfortable dedicating $10,000 toward RSPA. Expand Your Portfolio With SCHD and JEPQ Even though the RSPA ETF would already expose you to 500+ stocks, you still probably wouldn&#8217;t want to toss your entire $25,000 into just one fund. Consequently, we will now explore three more ETFs and, after conducting your own due diligence, you could invest $5,000 in each one of them. The first of these three intriguing funds is the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHD). This ETF tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index and has a portfolio comprising 103 stocks. Again, we&#8217;re looking for famous large-cap names and multi-sector diversification. The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF meets these expectations with recognizable stocks like Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Merck (NYSE:MRK), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and Chevron (NYSE:CVX). Moreover, the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF serves up a trailing 12-month distribution yield of 3.87% but only deducts 0.06% worth of annual operating expenses. Therefore, investors should have no objections to allocating $5,000 toward the SCHD ETF. Next up is the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:JEPQ), which is centered around the technology-focused NASDAQ 100 index. This fund includes 107 stocks so you can participate in the growth of tech&#8217;s heavy hitters, such as NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Committing $5,000 of your $25,000 portfolio to the JEPQ ETF will unlock extra share-price appreciation potential from a variety of top tech firms. You&#8217;ll also get access to substantial cash distributions as the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF features an impressive 11.52% annual yield. We&#8217;re still sticking to the low-cost theme here since JEPQ only deducts operating fees of 0.35% per year. So, why not add some technology-fueled firepower to your small portfolio with the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF? Round It Out With FDVV To round out your $25,000 passive-income plan, you could assign $5,000 toward the Fidelity High Dividend ETF (NYSEARCA:FDVV). Instead of concentrating on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&amp;P 500, or NASDAQ 100, the FVDD ETF corresponds to the Fidelity High Dividend Index. Among the holdings list of the Fidelity High Dividend ETF, you&#8217;ll find large-cap superstars like Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), Visa (NYSE:V), Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG), and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). Overall, you&#8217;ll get exposure to plenty of consistent dividend deliverers with FDVV. The other need-to-know stats are that the Fidelity High Dividend ETF offers a trailing 12-month distribution yield of 3.07% but only deducts 0.16% in annualized operating expenses. With all of those benefits in mind, you can proudly add $5,000 worth of FDVV shares to your $25,000 account. Now, you&#8217;ve got a four-pack of funds with RSPA as your anchor as well as SCHD, JEPQ, and FDVV for extra diversification. That&#8217;s a savvy plan to keep the fees to a minimum while turning your $25,000 account into a low-risk regular income producer.The post How to Build a Super Low Cost Passive Income Fund for Only $25,000 appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",973.0,495.0,9.0,2.0,8.0,1.0,2.0,6.0,3.0,0.0,0.01818181818181818,0.00404040404040404,0.01616161616161616,0.00202020202020202,0.00404040404040404,0.014141414141414142

Key Points in This Article: Arm Holdings (ARM) aims to capture 50% of the data center CPU market by 2025, up from 15% in 2024, primarily displacing x86 leaders Intel and AMD. The data center CPU market is projected to grow from $7.42 billion in 2024 to $8.35 billion in 2025, with Arm’s success potentially boosting its revenue to $3.3–3.4 billion and market cap to as much as 168.3 billion. Arm’s goal faces skepticism due to x86’s entrenched ecosystem, but its energy-efficient designs and hyperscaler adoption make it a formidable contender. On a Mission to Dominate British chip design titan Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) sent shockwaves through the tech industry earlier this year with a bold claim: it aims to capture 50% of the data center CPU market by the end of 2025, up from 15% in 2024. This ambitious goal threatens to reshape the competitive landscape, challenging x86 giants Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). As artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing drive unprecedented demand for energy-efficient processors, Arm’s rise could redefine the data center industry. But who stands to lose most, and what would this mean for Arm’s revenue and valuation? Who Arm Would Displace Arm’s audacious target puts Intel and AMD, the x86 architecture leaders, directly in its crosshairs. Intel, with its Xeon processors, has long dominated the data center CPU market, while AMD’s EPYC chips have gained traction with competitive performance. If Arm achieves a 50% share, it would primarily erode Intel’s larger market position, as Intel lacks new server CPUs until 2026, making it vulnerable to Arm’s energy-efficient designs like Amazon&#8216;s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS Graviton and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Grace. AMD would also face significant losses, as hyperscalers like AWS, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Google increasingly adopt Arm-based CPUs for their cost and power savings. Arm’s rise is fueled by the AI boom, with its CPUs serving as host chips in AI systems, and a growing Arm-native software ecosystem that challenges x86’s legacy advantage. A Big and Growing Data Center CPU Market The global data center chip market, encompassing CPUs, GPUs, and accelerators, was valued at $21.21 billion in 2024 by Grand View Research and is projected to grow at a 12.5% CAGR, reaching $23.86 billion by the end of this year. The CPU segment, roughly 30% to 40% of this market, translates to approximately $7.42 billion in 2024 and $8.35 billion in 2025 &#8212; an increase of $930 million. Arm’s 50% share of the CPU market would give it influence over $4.175 billion in chip value, a significant leap from its 15% share last year. What It Means for Arm’s Revenue and Valuation Arm’s business model, centered on licensing IP and collecting royalties (2% to 3% per data center chip), differs from traditional chipmakers. In fiscal 2025, Arm generated $4 billion in total revenue, with its cloud and networking business contributing approximately $326 million to $434 million, based on industry royalty estimates. Capturing 50% of the data center CPU market could boost Arm’s data center revenue to $504 million to $604 million, driving total revenue to as much as $4.1 billion. With some 4.175 million CPUs at a $1,000 average price and a 2.5% royalty, Arm could earn around $104 million in royalties, plus increased licensing fees from hyperscalers like AWS and Nvidia. Note, though, that analysts estimate Arm is earning higher royalty rates for its new v9 architecture, which Morningstar estimates could reach a blended 5% rate by 2030, which would scale revenue significantly higher. In terms of valuation, Arm’s current market cap is $172.5 billion at a stock price of $163 per share. Achieving its goal could justify a premium, with analysts projecting a forward P/E of 73 to 150. At a conservative P/E of 73 and fiscal 2025 earnings of $1.63 per share, Arm’s market cap could grow to around $200 billion. At a bullish P/E of 150, it could hit almost $260 billion by the end of the year. These ranges suggest a stock price between $190 and $246 per share, implying 16% and 51% upside by the end of the year. Analyst price targets currently average $142 per share, but attaining its goal could see them boost it much higher, reflecting optimism around Arm’s AI-driven growth. Key Takeaway Arm’s 50% target is ambitious but faces skepticism. Analysts like Omdia’s Manoj Sukumaran estimate Arm-based servers will reach only 20% to 23% of the market by the end of 2025, citing x86’s entrenched ecosystem and software compatibility challenges. Arm’s success hinges on flawless execution, hyperscaler adoption, and overcoming Intel and AMD’s potential counter-moves, like energy-efficient x86 designs. While Arm’s energy efficiency and AI relevance position it strongly, achieving 50% market share in one year seems aspirational. I&#8217;m not certain Arm Holdings can&#8217;t actually achieve its goal, but it&#8217;s clear the chip designer is laser focused on the future and even partial success could solidify its role as a data center powerhouse.

Live Updates Live Coverage Updates appear automatically as they are published. Markets Will Continue to Rally Until Nvidia Earnings 9:39 am The Nasdaq just opened 106 points higher at 21,285.34. From here, depending on the strength of Magnificent 7 stock earnings, trade deals, and the Federal Reserve, we could see the index closer to 22,000 later this week. Helping, JPMorgan says the market will continue to run until Nvidia reports earnings in late August. “We continue to find evidence for our bullish hypothesis: (i) resilient macro data; (ii) positive earnings growth; (iii) thawing trade war rhetoric,” JPMorgan said, as quoted by CNBC. “This week we are focused on [July nonfarm payrolls] and MegaCap Tech earnings.” We’re also waiting on earnings from Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple this week. Nasdaq could easily see higher highs 9:13 am With excitement over a trade deal with the US-EU, and hopefully with China, the Nasdaq could see higher highs. Helping, we&#8217;ll soon see major earnings from some of the top Magnificent 7 stocks, and hopeful hints of a potential interest rate cut by September&#8217;s Fed meeting. Stay tuned for more. Nasdaq futures are up about 108 points to 23,599 at the moment. If it can open at that level, that’ll put the tech-heavy index at new all-time highs. According to CNBC, “The moves come after the broad market index and the Nasdaq hit new all-time and closing highs during Monday’s trading session, just barely seeing gains. It was the 15th record close for the broad market index in 2025.” Fueling momentum, tech giants like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) soared by about $7.19 a share yesterday. Shares are up another $2.80 in premarket trading today. Helping, analysts at Bank of America just raised their price target on AMD to $200. The stock is also rising on news of a price increase for its Instinct MI350 chips. In addition, there’s been excitement over the recent US-EU trade deal. Now, markets are waiting to see if a deal can be made with China. That&#8217;s ahead of President Trump’s August 1 deadline. Plus, all eyes will be on the Federal Reserve, which is expected to leave interest rates as is. However, they’ll be listening to hints about a potential rate cut by September’s meeting. Friday will also be an important day, with the release of non-farm payroll numbers. Goldman Sachs Reiterated a Buy Rating on Microsoft Goldman Sachs says it’s bullish on Microsoft heading into earnings. “Microsoft is well-positioned to capitalize on this shift with a more capital-efficient and higher-margin recurring revenue model, just as it did during the on-prem to cloud transition,” as noted by CNBC. Analysts at Oppenheimer just reiterated a Perform rating on Apple ahead of earnings, noting, “We take a neutral view into AAPL’s F3Q25 earnings. We expect investors to focus on the revenue outlook for F4Q25 after normalizing the potential FX tailwind, Services revenue growth, and the sales trend in Greater China.” Citi analysts reiterated a buy rating on Coinbase, with a price target of $505 from $270. The firm noted the company has seen several catalysts recently. That includes the GENIUS Act, the House passage of the CLARITY Act, and its addition to the S&amp;P 500 index. Bank of America also reiterated a buy rating on Roblox, with a price target of $133. The firm sees an “extended runway for mid-20% growth as users worldwide adopt Roblox’s Metaverse, in a virtuous cycle that will draw developers, brands, and merchants to the platform,” as also quoted by CNBC.

Close Shares of Marvell Technology (MRVL) soared on Wednesday after Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the chipmaker’s stock, citing the “exceptional” strength of AI demand. Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore on Wednesday raised his Marvell price target by about 10% to $80 while maintaining an “equal weight” rating. “Marvell is firmly in the AI winners camp, and sentiment has swung aggressively negative compared to a few months ago,” Moore wrote. “We are more excited for their opportunity in optical, which brings higher margin and durability vs. their ASIC opportunity, which has disappointed.” (ASIC refers to application-specific integrated circuit, a class of customizable chip that combines several circuits to perform tasks that would otherwise require multiple interconnected chips.) Marvell shares were up more than 9% in recent trading, making it the best-performing stock in the Nasdaq 100. Despite Wednesday's gain, Marvell shares are down about 23% since the start of the year. Marvell is just one of several semiconductor stocks Moore expects to benefit from strong AI demand over the next year. He also raised his 12-month price targets on Nvidia (NVDA) by 17%, Broadcom (AVGO) by 25%, Astera Labs (ALAB) by 26%, and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) by more than 50%. All of those stocks were also trading in the green on Wednesday. (Read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here.) “While stock prices have moved higher, our conviction on AI spend durability in 2026 continues to grow,” Moore wrote. Google parent Alphabet (GOOG) last week raised its full-year capital expenditures forecast, citing the need to accelerate data center buildouts to meet seemingly insatiable demand for AI and cloud computing. Investors will get more updates on the strength of AI investment after markets close on Wednesday when tech giants Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) report earnings.

Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Roku (ROKU) +2.13% 4:45 pm Roku executed cleanly, but the modest stock move reflects already high expectations. Free cash flow, platform margin expansion, and a solid Q3 guide reaffirm the recovery story. The question now is whether Roku can re-accelerate engagement and ad yield fast enough to justify further multiple expansion. More Takeaways 4:43 pm Platform Margins Rebound: Platform gross profit rose 20% YoY, while platform gross margin rebounded to 54.5% (up from 51.8% last quarter). This reflects improving ad pricing and better optimization of first-party demand. Free Cash Flow Turns Positive Again: Roku reported $26.5 million in free cash flow, swinging back into the black after a few quarters of cash burn. Operating leverage from better gross margins and tight expense control helped drive the shift. Active Accounts &amp; Engagement Trends 4:35 pm Active Accounts: 84.8 million (up 1.7M QoQ, up 12% YoY) Streaming Hours: 31.7 billion (flat QoQ, up 20% YoY) Roku added more accounts than expected, but total streaming hours plateaued sequentially — a key area to watch as engagement fuels ad inventory monetization. Guidance Update 4:23 pm Roku provided the following Q3 2025 outlook: Revenue: ~$940 million Adj. EBITDA: $(20) million Gross Profit: ~$430 million This represents a ~7.6% sequential growth in topline revenue, while narrowing EBITDA losses significantly. Gross margin guidance implies modest operating leverage ahead. CEO Anthony Wood emphasized that advertising spend is stabilizing, and Roku continues to gain share of traditional TV budgets. The tone was cautiously optimistic, especially on the AI-powered ad tools improving campaign efficiency and targeting. “We are seeing healthy engagement and strong monetization as marketers adapt to converged TV,” said Wood. CFO Dan Jedda added that “Disciplined expense management” remains a top priority amid evolving macro conditions.

It&#8217;s a good quarter for Apple that might start turning around what&#8217;s been a disappointing 2025. Tim Cook on AI 5:58 pm TD Cowen Analst: Tim, I was curious about your thoughts on AI for edge devices. There&#8217;s like some people who think that LLM could be a commodity in the future. Do you think &#8212; do you see a scenario where the LLM become a third part of your iOS or is the SLM the way to go and how to think about evolution of edge devices in a futuristic AI world and is smartphone going to be the choice of device. Just curious your thoughts on it, broadly speaking. Timothy Cook Chief Executive Officer The way that we look at AI is that it&#8217;s 1 of the most profound technologies of our lifetime. And I think it will affect all devices in a significant way what pieces of the chain are commoditized and not commoditized, I wouldn&#8217;t want to to really talk about today. because that gives away some things on our strategy. But I think it&#8217;s a good question. . Tim Cook on Apple Momentum 5:48 pm Here&#8217;s what Tim Cook had to say about Apple&#8217;s surprising momentum in China last quarter: &#8220;Yes. We did grow in Greater China by 4% during the quarter versus the previous quarter, it was driven by an acceleration by iPhone, although we also had substantial growth on the MAC year-over-year. From a &#8212; as you know, the government has placed certain subsidies that affects some of our products, not all of them, but there are some of them. And I think that had some effect. It was the first full quarter of the subsidy playing out. that cut in during a portion of the previous quarter. The other things I would say are that the installed base hit a record high in Greater China &#8212; and we set an all-time record for the iPhone installed base. The iPhone upgraders in Mainland China set a record for the June quarter. And according to Boral Panel, which was formerly known as Kantar, iPhone had the top 3 models in Urban China, which is extraordinary. Also, if you look at the other products, Mac, iPad and watch, the majority of customers that are buying in China Mainland were new to the product. So lots of good things there. And the other thing I would point out, which is an interesting point, The MacBook Air was the top-selling laptop model in all of China, and the Mac Mini was the top-selling desktop model in all of China. So overall, a positive &#8212; very positive quarter.&#8221; Apple&#039;s CFO Says AI Investments Will Rise 5:47 pm &#8220;I would say, a pretty significant driver as Tim talked about, is the fact we are increasing our investment significantly in AI. So that is certainly a component of it. As you know, we&#8217;ve been investing in private cloud compute, which is also in our first-party data centers. The other piece, as you know, is we do have a hybrid strategy where in cases we do use third parties to make capital investments, and we also invest in our own. So you are going to see an increase in CapEx. We also, from time to time, have other investments in facilities in tooling, but I would say a significant portion of the driver of growth that you&#8217;re seeing now is really driven by some of our AI-related investments.&#8221; &#8211; Kevan Parekh, Apple CFO Tariff Implications 5:22 pm On Apple&#8217;s conference call they just said they incurred $800 million in tariff-related costs last quarter.

Shares of Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) gained 3.95% over the past five trading sessions after reporting Q2 earnings on July 31, bringing the e-commerce and cloud storage solutions stock&#8217;s year-to-date gain into the green with a gain of 0.67%. Over the past year, it is up 32.91%. On July 8, it was reported that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos sold nearly three million shares worth $665.8 million over two days in July as part of a plan announced earlier in 2025 that will see Bezos unload up to 25 million shares through May 2026. In its most recent earnings call, the company reported that net sales increased 13% to $167.7 billion in the second quarter, compared with $148.0 billion in the year-prior quarter. Net income increased to $18.2 billion, or $1.68 per diluted share, compared with $13.5 billion, or $1.26 per diluted share, in Q2 2024. However, free cash flow decreased to $18.2 billion TTM, compared with $53.0 billion TTM the year prior due to Amazon&#8217;s ongoing CapEx on AI. In June and July the stock saw a series of adjusted price targets. Analysts at Stifel ($262 from $245), Barclays ($275 from $240), Bank of America ($272 from $265), Piper Sandler ($255 from $250), Capital ($270 from $233), Citi ($265 from $225), Needham ($265 from $220), Cantor Fitzgerald ($260 from $240), Truist ($250 from $226), all recently upgraded their price targets for AMZN. Amazon announced in July that it has deployed its 1 millionth robot while also deploying its new AI foundation model to power its robotic fleet. Its first twelfth generation automated fulfillment center launched in late-2024 and the robots are primarily focused on delivery station efficiencies. The robotics cycle is &#8220;early,&#8221; according to Bank of America&#8217;s analyst, who expects Amazon to leverage robots to reduce labor dependency, increase order accuracy and improve warehouse efficiency, driving material cost savings. While there can be little doubt about Amazon&#8217;s current financial health, investors and potential investors may be right to wonder whether growth can continue at Amazon&#8217;s historic pace, and whether the stock is safe as a long-term holding. Let&#8217;s take a look at where the share price could be headed. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: Amazon is facing substantial headwinds this year, but the stock remains fundamentally sound with a &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; rating. AWS, AI and ad sales continue to be major drivers for the Magnificent Seven stock. If you’re looking for a megatrend with massive potential, make sure to grab a complimentary copy of our “The Next NVIDIA” report. This report breaks down AI stocks with 10x potential and will give you a huge leg up on profiting from this massive sea change. Why Invest in Amazon? In the past 20 years, Amazon&#8217;s stock is up more than 9,491%. The company has been called one of the most influential economic and cultural forces in the world, and its brand is one of the world&#8217;s most valuable. Though the stock tumbled as the COVID-19 pandemic waned and lockdowns ended (along with the broader markets), it has more than recovered. Shares of this Magnificent Seven member hit an all-time high on Feb. 4, 2025, but with the Nasdaq briefly entering bear market territory in March, it had been downhill for Amazon in 2025. There have been signs of hope recently, with AMZN rebounding along with the broad market. It is hard to imagine that the company or its share price will collapse any time soon, but analysts and investors may see the stock as overbought. Let&#8217;s see what Wall Street expects. Amazon as a Company The company engages in the retail sale of consumer products, advertising, and subscriptions service through online and physical stores internationally. It also manufactures and sells electronic devices and develops and produces media content. Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides compute, storage, database, analytics, machine learning, and other services. And Amazon Prime is the company&#8217;s membership program. Amazon is based in Seattle. It was founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos, the former chief executive officer and now executive board chair. Amazon went public in May 1997. Its retail competitors include Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE:BABA), Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT). It also competes with the likes of Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT). The company continues its push into artificial intelligence with an update of its Alexa feature to Alexa+. AWS investments in cloud computing and AI also continue, with the former being the world&#8217;s largest cloud services provider and the latter nearing its debut of its &#8220;Nova&#8221; chatbot, which will compete in price with ChatGPT. Additionally, Amazon has been expanding its same-day delivery services, and its entertainment division has secured the James Bond franchise with the acquisition of MGM Studios. Headwinds include ongoing labor issues. The most recent quarterly results showed strong performance, with AWS as a major growth driver. Amazon as a Stock Wall Street analysts&#8217; median price target of $264.21 is above Amazon&#8217;s all-time high share price seen earlier this year and good for potential upside of 19.17%. Of the 44 analysts covering AMZN, all but one assign it a &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating, with the other assigning it a &#8220;Hold&#8221; rating. Overall, the stock receives a consensus &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; rating. With 63.76% of shares held by institutional investors — including notable stakes from the three largest asset management companies, Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street — the stock is popular among Wall Street&#8217;s sell-side firms. Institutional holdings of Amazon have seen net increase with 3,073 position increases versus 2,270 position decreases. Wall Street expectations for where the stock goes in the next 52 weeks vary. While analysts overall anticipate healthy upside, the lowest price target indicates a decline in the share price. The consensus projection signals strong upside potential for the next 52 weeks, based on strong forward guidance for business segments like AWS and Prime Video&#8217;s ad sales, which saw enormous year-over-year increases as the platform now hosts the NFL&#8217;s Thursday Night Football programming. Estimate Price Target %Change From Current Price Low $235 5.99% Median $264.21 19.17% High $300.00 35.31% Amazon does face some headwinds and risks in addition to those mentioned above. Consumer spending has rebounded in the wake of Trump&#8217;s tariff threats and subsequent pauses, which could help GDP in Q2 after it contracted GDP in Q1, raising the risks of a possible recession in 2025. Over the past three months, the consumer discretionary sector of the S&amp;P 500 — into which Amazon falls — has performed the fourth best, posting a gain of 8.94%. While the company dominates in the retail space and is a tech leader, competition in neither category is likely to go away anytime soon. All these things could have a huge impact on profitability. Despite some skeptics, the prospects for Amazon are optimistic overall, especially in the short term. Wall Street&#8217;s &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; consensus rating and the upside potential far outweigh the downside potential shares of AMZN face.
