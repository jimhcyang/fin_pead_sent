It was a record quarter driven by our commercial cloud, which surpassed $16 billion in revenue, up 34% year-over-year. What we are witnessing is the dawn of a second wave of digital transformation sweeping every company and every industry. Digital capability is key to both resilience and growth. It's no longer enough to just adopt technology. Businesses need to build their own technology to compete and grow. Microsoft is powering the shift with the world's largest and most comprehensive cloud platform. And now I'll briefly highlight how we are innovating across every layer of the modern tech stack starting with Azure. We are building Azure as the world's computer to support organizations growing cloud needs. We are investing to bring our cloud services to more customers announcing seven new data center regions in Asia, Europe and Latin America and adding support for top secret classified workloads in the United States. We've always led in hybrid computing and we are accelerating our innovation to meet customers where they are. Azure Stack HCI, now broadly available, helps businesses extend the power of the cloud to sovereign workloads. More than thousand customers now use as Azure Arc to simplify hybrid management and run Azure services across on-premises, multi-cloud and at the edge. And with Azure Digital Twins organizations, like Bentley Systems, Honeywell Industries and Johnson Controls can bridge the digital and physical worlds, creating simulations of factories, cities to optimize their operations. We are seeing momentum in every industry. Deutsche Telekom rely on Azure to modernize its IT infrastructure through a partnership with Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard as well as Verily, our cloud will be used to help more researchers analyze biomedical data. Cruise and GM chose Azure as their preferred cloud as they work to make autonomous driving mainstream. And just last Friday, we announced an expansion of our partnership with SAP to accelerate the adoption of SAP workloads on Azure. In the past six months, we've seen Tier 1 ERP migrations from companies such as Bayer, Carhartt, Coats and PepsiCo to Azure. At the data layer, Azure is the only cloud with limitless data and analytics capabilities that enable organizations to build the predictive and analytical path required to digitally transform. Azure Synapse brings together big data, data warehousing and data integration all into one powerful solution. Leading companies like FedEx, Grab and P&G are using Synapse to generate immediate insights from massive amounts of structured and unstructured data and we are seeing strong overall growth in our analytics business as companies accelerate their data initiatives to build competitive advantage. Data governance is top of mind for every business leader and will grow into an important category on its own as critical as any AI or analytics category today. We are investing to participate in this growth. New Azure Purview provides an end-to-end view of an organization's data estate across on-premise, multi-cloud and SaaS apps that previously was impossible. In AI, we offer the most comprehensive portfolio of tools, frameworks and infrastructure, enabling businesses to build mission-critical solutions that comprehend speech, understand natural language, make predictions, provide insights, and support decision-making. Our Azure Health Bot, for example, is being used by organizations like the CDC, Premera Blue Cross, and Walgreens to build virtual healthcare assistants used by more than 80 million people worldwide at a time when expanding access to healthcare information is more critical than ever. Now to developers. Developers have been critical to business continuity over the last year, and we’re helping them collaborate and scale their impact to drive organizational outcomes. From GitHub to Visual Studio, we have the most widely used and loved toolchain to help developers rapidly go from idea to code and code to cloud. Use of GitHub is becoming key to building digital capability in every company across every industry. Today, GitHub is used by more than 56 million developers, as well as 3 million organizations – from BuzzFeed and Plaid, to Marsh & McLennan, Oracle, and Volvo Car. Now to Power Platform. We are empowering domain experts, enabling anyone in any organization to build applications, automate processes, create virtual agents, and analyze data. Power Platform is the clear leader in low code/no code development, with more than 11 million monthly active users, up 95% year-over-year. Businesses like Nestle and Humana chose Power BI this quarter to help employees use data to make smarter decisions. In public sector, the city of Kobe, in Japan, is relying on Power Virtual Agents and Power Automate to keep citizens informed, building intelligent bots to answer frequently asked questions, as well as automated workflows to route inquiries. Vaccine distribution perhaps best exemplifies the critical need for digital capability across the globe, and our Vaccination Registration and Administration Solution, built on Power Platform, enables governments to manage the end-to-end process, from screening and scheduling, to administration, and follow ups. In Australia, the government of Victoria is relying on our tools to help deliver doses to more than 6 million residents, and here in the United States, Minnesota, Nebraska, and Oklahoma are using our capabilities. Our Return to the Workplace solution in Power Platform is also helping organizations keep workers safe and healthy when they go back to the office. And we’re adding new capabilities to ensure people have verifiable, secure access to their vaccination records. Now to Dynamics 365. We are taking share as companies in every industry turn to new business applications to grow. Customer expectations are changing faster than ever before requiring near real-time visibility into trends, behavior, and needs. Our customer data platform, Customer Insights, leads its category and has helped customers unify over 2 billion customer profiles, providing a single view of interactions across marketing, sales, and e-commerce to deliver more personalized experiences. More companies are turning to our mixed reality solutions to help frontline employees connected even when they are apart. L’Oréal, for example, is using Dynamics 365 Remote Assist and HoloLens 2 to help technicians repair equipment at factories even when they cannot travel. In retail, our applications were front and center at NRF earlier this month. Dynamics 365 Commerce now supports both B2C and B2B e-commerce, enabling retailers like Columbia Sportswear to ship inventory from stores and offer contactless payment options. PromoteIQ continues to scale rapidly, with retailers like DICK’S Sporting Goods, The Home Depot, and Kroger using the platform to power their digital vendor marketing programs. Finally, our new Microsoft Cloud for Retail is bringing together our platform and tools across the shopper journey, accelerating time to value. It builds on the success of the Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare, which is being used by organizations, including Providence, to empower clinicians to better serve patients. Now to LinkedIn. We once again saw record levels of engagement across the platform, as LinkedIn’s nearly 740 million members use the network to connect, learn, and find new opportunities. Sessions increased 30%. Conversations were up 48%. And hours spent on LinkedIn Learning were up 2X, compared to a year ago. LinkedIn’s advertising business had a record quarter, accounting for more than a third of LinkedIn’s total revenue. LinkedIn’s Marketing Solutions was up over 50%, as advertisers increasingly turn to the platform as the trusted way to reach professionals ready to do business. Finally, we continue to benefit from the secular shift to remote selling. Businesses are using the combination of LinkedIn Sales Navigator and Dynamics 365 to ensure salespeople have the context they need to sell remotely, while new tools help sales organizations use LinkedIn data to identify and size opportunities. Now to Microsoft 365. The pandemic has proven the PC’s central role in keeping people connected, productive, and secure. We added more new devices running Windows 10 this quarter than ever before. At CES, our partners showcased new PCs designed for the new ways we work, learn, and play. And our Pluton security processor, built by AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm, will bring chip-to-cloud security. Flexible work is here to stay. To empower the digital workforce, organizations will need an organizing layer for all the ways people work, learn, and collaborate. That’s what Microsoft 365 and Teams uniquely provide. Teams is the only solution with meetings, calls, chat, content collaboration with Office and business process workflows in a secure, integrated user experience. We are seeing larger deployments. 117 organizations have more than 100,000 users of Teams, and over 2,700 organizations have over 10,000. And Teams has nearly 60 million daily active users on mobile alone. Teams enables people to collaborate both synchronously and asynchronously, retain business context, and stay in the flow of work – driving increased usage across Office 365 and Power Platform. Power Platform monthly average usage on Teams has grown 4X year-over-year, and with Microsoft Dataverse, anyone can now create and deploy custom solutions with Power Apps and intelligent bots with Power Virtual Agents directly in Teams. Teams is rapidly becoming the de facto unified communications platform of choice for every organization. New features like voice enabled channels create a more powerful and streamlined calling experience, and noise suppression and live captions with speaker attribution make meetings more accessible. At Accenture alone, audio conferencing on Teams has increased to over 1 billion minutes a month, as 85,000 employees use Teams to make external calls. And, this quarter, Lumen, formerly CenturyLink, rolled out Teams calling globally to 42,000 employees in just four weeks. The pandemic has shown the importance of empowering the two billion frontline workers around the world with the right technology. 390,000 associates at home depot will use Microsoft 365 including Yammer to foster connection and engagement across the organization and more than 500,000 employees of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, including healthcare workers use Teams to collaborate. In education more than 200 million students and educators worldwide rely on Microsoft education products for remote learning and leading customers in every industry including Amgen, AT&T, Diamler, GSK and Ikea are increasingly turning to our premium offerings for advanced security compliance, voice analytics capabilities. Microsoft 365 E5 revenue has grown triple digits for the past four quarters. Now the security. The reason solarwinds attack are a stark reminder of how critical security is to our customers. We're focused on ensuring organizations deploy and maintain a zero trust fork architecture. Our end-to-end security capabilities inclusive of identity, security, compliance and management across all clouds and all client platforms have been key as we help customers strengthen their security posture and mitigate impact. Beyond our products our operational security posture and threat intelligence which analyzes 8 trillion signals each day help customers defend themselves. Over the past 12 months our security business revenue has surpassed 10 billion up more than 40%. This milestone is a testament to the deep trust organizations place in us and we will continue to invest in new capabilities across all our products and services to protect our customers. We see strong momentum in usage of our products in identity Azure 80 is more than 425 million monthly active users. In security Microsoft Defender block nearly 6 billion threats last year alone. In management we saw triple digit growth in the number of devices managed by Microsoft in June and in compliance we have seen 90% increase in our customer base year-over-year. Now onto gaming. We surpassed 5 billion in revenue for the first time in this quarter as we expand our opportunity to reach the world's three billion gamers wherever they play. The launch of Xbox series X and series S was the most successful in our history with the most devices ever sold in a launch month. Game developers are benefiting too as they turn to us to reach more players and scale the games using the power of our cloud. We exceeded $2 billion in revenue from third-party titles this quarter for the first time. We're gaining console share as gamers recognize the value of our broader ecosystem. Xbox Live has more than a 100 million monthly active users while Game Pass now has 18 million subscribers and we are transforming how games are distributed played and viewed bringing cloud gaming and game pass to iOS devices and Windows PCs over the next few months. We are pleased with the overall growth in our consumer subscriptions with Game Pass and more than 47 million Microsoft 365 personal family subscribers we have a large and growing consumer subscription business and we see significant opportunity in both of these segments as they move to services and on demand models. In closing I'm energized by our increasing momentum and the expanding opportunity fueled by the structural change brought about by the rapid adoption of digital technology. We're investing to meeting these needs in the coming decade and I'm optimistic about what's ahead. With that I'll hand it over to Amy will cover our financial results in detail and share our outlook and I look forward to rejoining you after for questions.",2161.0,1212.0,40.0,6.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,9.0,4.0,4.0,0.033003300330033,0.0049504950495049506,0.0049504950495049506,0.0008250825082508251,0.0016501650165016502,0.028052805280528052

This quarter revenue was $43.1 billion up 17% and 15% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.03 increasing 34% and 31% in constant currency. Across our business results exceeded expectations driven by strong execution and improving trend across industries, customer segments and geographical markets resulting in double digit top and bottom line growth. In our commercial business customers prioritize their digital transformation which drove healthy demand for our hybrid and cloud offerings with material growth in the number of $10 million plus Azure and Microsoft 365 contracts. We saw stronger Azure consumption as well as higher usage of Teams, Power Platform and our advanced security and compliance offerings and within our small and medium business customer segments transactional licensing trends continued to show some improvement. [indiscernible] our Windows OEM, Office consumer and a surface businesses. The advertising market continue to show improvement benefiting our search and LinkedIn businesses and in gaming, we saw record engagement and monetization across our platform as well as console demand that has significantly exceeded supply following the Xbox series X and S launches. Moving to our overall results. Even with the declining expiration base and a strong prior year comparable commercial bookings increased 19% and 11% in constant currency. Strong execution across our core annuity sales motions including the Azure and Microsoft 365 momentum that earlier drove the better than expected result. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 24% to 22% of constant currency to $112 billion with a roughly equivalent split between the revenue that will be recognized within and the portion beyond the next 12 months. And our annuity mix increased 4.0 over year to 93%. Commercial cloud revenue was $16.7 billion as growth accelerated to 34% and 32% in constant currency. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage expanded 4.0 points year-over-year to 71% driven by the change in accounting estimate for the useful life of server and networking equipment assets. Excluding this impact commercial cloud gross margin percentage was up slightly. As a reminder revenue mix shift to Azure increased customer usage of our productivity and collaboration solutions and continue strategic investments to support customers success and the deployment of our solutions will continue to impact gross margin. With the weaker U.S. dollar FX increased revenue growth by approximately 2 points about a point more favorable than anticipated. FX had no impact on comps growth and increased operating expense growth by approximately one point both in line with expectations. Gross margin dollars increased 18% and 16% constant currency. Gross margin percentage was 67% up slightly year-over-year with roughly 2 points of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate noted earlier. Excluding this impact company gross margin percentage was down driven by the sales mix shift to cloud and gaming. Operating expenses increased 3% and 2% constant currency lower than anticipated driven by greater than expected COVID related savings, reductions and retail store expenses and investments that shifted to future quarters. Overall company headcount grew more than 10% to year-over-year with our focused investment in key areas such as customer success, cloud engineering and sales. Operating income increased 29% and 26% in constant currency and operating margins expanded 4 points year-over-year to 42% including roughly 2 points of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate and nearly one point of variable impact from COVID related savings. Now to our segment results. Revenue from productivity and business processes was $13.4 billion increasing 13% and 11% in constant currency ahead of expectations primarily driven by office commercial and LinkedIn on a stronger prior year comparable and included roughly 3 points of benefits primarily from transactional strength in Japan. Office commercial revenue grew 11% and 9% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue grew 21% and 20% constant currency. Results were driven installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments as well as higher ARPU. The strong demand for Microsoft 365 noted earlier particularly for our security, compliance and voice components drove E5 revenue growth acceleration again this quarter. Paid Office 365 commercial seats increased 15% year-over-year with strong conversion of our free trial offers. We also saw a steep growth improvement in our small and medium business and first line worker offerings. Office consumer revenue grew 7% and 6% in constant currency on a strong comparable that included roughly 7 points of benefit from transactional strength in Japan. Microsoft 365 consumer subscriptions grew to 47.5 million up 28% year-over-year.

Operating expenses increased 4% and 3% in constant currency and operating income increased 19% and 17% in constant currency, including 5 points due to the change in accounting estimate. Next the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $14.6 billion ahead of expectations increasing 23% and 22% in constant currency. Server products and cloud services revenue increased 26% and 24% in constant currency. Azure revenue grew 50% and 48% in constant currency driven by strong growth in our consumption based business that benefited from Improvement across industries and customer segments noted earlier. Our per-user results were also better than expected driven by accelerated growth in our enterprise mobility and security installed base up 29% to over 163 million seats and on a strong prior year comparable that included roughly 4 points of benefit from the end of support for Windows Server 2008. Our on-premise server business increased 4% and 3% in constant currency with strong annuity performance driven by continued demand for our hybrid and premium offerings. Enterprise services revenue grew 5% and 4% in constant currency again driven by premier support services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 29% and 27% in constant currency and gross margin percentage increased 3 points year-over-year with roughly 3 points of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate. Operating expenses increased 12% and 11% in constant currency and operating income grew 43% and 41% in constant currency with roughly 10% favorable impact from the change and accounting estimate. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $15.1 billion increasing 14% and 13% in constant currency and better than expected performance across all businesses. In Windows, the stronger PC market resulted in overall OEM revenue growth of 1% despite a strong prior year comparable and OEM pro from the end of support for Windows 7. OEM non-pro revenue grew 24% and OEM pro revenue declined 9%. Inventory levels ended the quarter in the normal range. Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 10% and 8% in constant currency driven by continued demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions. In Surface revenue grew 3% and 1% in constant currency. Search revenue ex TAC increased 2% and 1% in constant currency benefiting from the improved advertising market noted earlier. And in Gaming revenue increased 51% And 50% in constant currency. Xbox hardware revenue grew 86% driven by the new console launch as well as the benefit from lower price promotions on our prior generation consoles. Xbox content and services revenue grew 40% and 38% in constant currency the strong growth in third party transactions, Game Pass subscribers and first-party titles. Segment gross margin dollars increased 11% and 9% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased 2 points year-over-year driven by sales mix shift to gaming. Operating expense decreased 10% and operating income grew 25% and 22% in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures including finance leases were $5.4 billion up 20% year-over-year to support growing global demand and customer usage of our cloud services. Cash paid for PP&E was $4.2 billion. Cash flow from operations was $12.5 billion increased 17% year-over-year as strong cloud billings and collections were partially offset by payments related to a tax audit settlement. Free cash flow was $8.3 billion up 17%. Excluding the impact of these tax payments cash flow from operations and free cash flow grew 33% and 41% respectively. Other income and expense was $440 million higher than anticipated primarily driven by net gains on investments including mark to market gains on our equity portfolio as well as net gains on foreign currency remeasurement. Our effective tax rate was approximately 16% in line with expectations. And finally we returned $10 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends; an increase of 18% year-over-year. Now let's move to our outlook. My commentary for both the next quarter and any remarks for the full year does not include any impact from the ZeniMax acquisition which we still expect to close by the end of the fiscal year. In our commercial business, consistent execution, focus on customer success and a compelling solution portfolio in high growth markets should drive another strong quarter. In our consumer business we expect to see healthy demand for PCs and productivity tools continue. The growth rates will again be impacted by the end of support for Windows 7 last year. In Gaming, we expect continued strong engagement on the Xbox platform and significant demand for the Xbox series X and S that will still be constrained by supply and our search in LinkedIn businesses should benefit from the improving advertising market. In commercial bookings we have a growing Q3 expiry base and a low prior year comparable. So strong execution across our core annuity sales motions and increased commitment to our cloud platform should drive healthy growth. As a reminder an increasing mix of large long-term Azure contracts which are more unpredictable in their timing can drive quarterly volatility and the growth rates. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage increased by approximately 3.0 year-over-year again driven by the change in accounting estimate. Excluding this impact continued improvement in Azure IaaS and PaaS gross margin will be offset by revenue make shift to Azure and continued investments to support our customer success. We expect a sequential increase on a dollar basis to our capital expenditures as we continue to invest to meet growing global demand for our cloud services. Now to FX. Based on current rates we expect FX to increase total company revenue COGS and operating expense growth by approximately 2 points. Within the segments FX should increase productivity and business processes revenue growth by approximately 3 points and intelligent cloud and more personal computing revenue growth by approximately 2 points. Now to segment guidance. In productivity and business processes we expect revenue between $13.35 billion and $13.6 billion. In Office commercial revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with continued upsell opportunity to E5. In our on-premise business though we anticipate continued improvement in transactional purchasing trends we expect revenue to decline in the mid to high teens range consistent with the ongoing customer shift to the cloud. In Office consumer on a strong prior year comparable revenue growth should be similar to last quarter with continued growth in Microsoft 365 subscription revenue. In LinkedIn we expect continued strong engagement on the platform to drive revenue growth in the low 20% range and in dynamics continued momentum will drive revenue growth similar to last quarter. For Intelligent Cloud we expect revenue between $14.7 billion and $14.95 billion. In Azure revenue will again be driven by strong growth in our consumption-based business and in our per-user business we expect continued benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum. In our on-premise server business we expect revenue growth to be in the low to mid single digits driven by continued demand for our hybrid and premium annuity offerings on a strong prior year comparable that included the benefit from the end of support for Windows server 2008. And Enterprise services revenue growth should be roughly in line with last quarter. In More Personal Computing we expect revenue between $12.3 billion and $12.7 billion. In Windows overall OEM revenue growth should be in the low single digits on a strong comparable mentioned earlier. Windows commercial products and cloud services growth should be in the low to mid teens driven by continued demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions. And in Surface good demand against a low prior comparable should drive growth in the mid to high teens range. In Search ex TAC growth should be driven by improvements in the advertising market and in Gaming we expect revenue growth of approximately 40% driven by next generation console sales as well as Xbox content and services revenue in the mid 20% range. Now back to the company guidance. We expect COGS of $13.1 billion to $13.3 billion and operating expense of $11.9 billion to $12 billion. Another income and expense interest income and expense should offset each other. We expect our Q3 tax rate to be approximately 15% slightly lower than our full year rate of approximately 16%. And finally, for FY21 with our strong performance in the first half of the fiscal year and our outlook for Q3 we expect to deliver another full year of double-digit revenue and operating income growth as well as healthy operating margin expansion even after excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate and COVID related savings. In closing, we have executed well in the first half of our fiscal year in a challenging and changing environment. Investments made over quarters and often years coupled with focused execution by our teams are the drivers behind a compelling portfolio that is delivering value today for our customers and creating optimism in our roadmap for tomorrow. Satya discussed our unique, comprehensive and integrated set of products earlier on the call; products and services that span large growth markets and we will continue to invest broadly and boldly against the significant opportunities ahead of us.

I think one of the things that we're seeing is the COVID impact has put a lot of constraints on our all our customers. But the one structural change is the digital technology is becoming critical even for core resilience and business continuity and to deal with what is going to be a structurally changed customer behavior and expectations. So as a tech company with that comprehensive differentiated portfolio all the way from business applications, industry solutions to infrastructure, I think, we benefit from that and that's what you saw this quarter. But more importantly, for me, Mark, when I look at the next 10 years of what compute and digital technology will do across industries, that's the opportunity that we are obviously staying very, very focused on and investing in.",146.0,66.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.015151515151515152,0.0,0.015151515151515152,0.0,0.015151515151515152,0.015151515151515152

I would say again with Azure, some of the core differentiation we have whether it comes to our hybrid leadership, some of the new data products that are highly differentiated and competitive in the marketplace as well as the integration with every other layer of our stack whether it's the dev layer with Power Platform or Github or with Teams to Power Apps to Azure DB, the industry solutions we now have in healthcare and in retail are all leading to that time to value the price differentiation and cost advantage to customers and most importantly, agility -- their ability to build their own digital capability. So that's what you see in the acceleration around Azure. But when we think about Microsoft Cloud, we think about all the parts coming together to deliver value and differentiation to our customers. A – Amy Hood: And maybe just to add a couple of thoughts on the shape, Brent, and to make sure that we're clear on some of the important drivers there, really, the Azure consumption comments are not about size of transactions, right, being signed and you obviously saw we had a good quarter in bookings, which is far more reflective of future commitment. In quarter, what we saw is really fundamental consumption growth and some reacceleration of growth curves, particularly in maybe industries that had been more hard hit in Q4 and Q1. And so I would describe it a little bit that way and including frankly, even some mid-market and some segment-based recovery on that front. So as I look forward, obviously, it's about what Satya talked about, which is there is differentiation, there is usage, there is looking forward to making sure that we continue to have great bookings numbers.

It was comfortably above where everybody, I think, is modeling. And in particular, I wanted to ask you about Office 365. Of all the businesses, the larger ones in Microsoft, most saw upside in this recent quarter except perhaps for Office 365, where despite the migration to E5 and despite the free-to-paid seat conversion, we really didn't see an acceleration in Office 365. I'm wondering if you could perhaps unpack that and describe why? And part two to the question is your guide for that segment is so good in the March quarter that one would infer that the Office 365 growth is likely to accelerate in March. I'm wondering if you could confirm whether that's a reasonable assumption?

As you heard, actually, almost all the components in Q3 have sort of consistent to slightly better execution, right?. So there is upside that we saw in LinkedIn. There is upside in Office Commercial. There is upside that's reflected in the stronger subscriptions number we saw in consumer and there is good execution and dynamics. So for me, it's a bit more and then we'll come back and talk about Microsoft 365 all up in a second. Each of those pieces, there is really consistent performance into Q3, which is good. And so when you think about Office 365, interestingly, what we're seeing is a lot of the things we had seen before. But remember, we had a pretty tough comp a year ago in Office Commercial. And so for me, I look and say, gosh, we did great execution. We saw some improving trends in seat growth in the frontline; improving trends in SMB that won't yet be reflected, of course, in revenue; seeing good trial conversion, which again speaks to forward revenue more than in-quarter revenue given that's all subscription. And we saw - so you see better seat growth, good conversion and good E5 selling. So I actually feel pretty good leaving Q2 and entering Q3 in terms of value that customers are getting out of the subscriptions that they've got and the conversions that we're seeing in market.",258.0,112.0,11.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.09821428571428571,0.008928571428571428,0.008928571428571428,0.0,0.0,0.08928571428571429

Satya I wanted to dig into one of the topics that you mentioned in your introduction and that's kind of Teams working as a framework across all of your solutions and sort of connecting more and more people into the Microsoft framework. I was doing some calls this quarter and asking about a competitor's acquisition of a Team's competitor and a lot of people in the channel talk to me about how Teams was pulling through dynamic CRM and they understood that acquisition as a defense against that and I was surprised to hear that that there would be a linkage between the two. Could you help us one kind of understand how Teams pulled in additional products behind it number one and number two the connection between kind of Teams and how they get a broader base of frontline workers into the story from Microsoft because I think most people think about Microsoft is like an information worker story for frontline workers is another huge kind of area for you guys to go after.,190.0,85.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.011764705882352941,0.023529411764705882,0.011764705882352941,0.0,0.0,-0.011764705882352941

That is absolutely right and I think I commented on this earlier as well in our calls which is we built Teams as essentially this tool that brings together multiple capabilities. It brings together chat. It brings together meetings, collaboration that is office collaboration as well as business process workflow all into one scaffolding. That's the biggest breakthrough of Teams. In the past obviously we had suites of tools but this is the first product more so than Outlook was even in terms of being able to integrate communications, collaboration and business process and that's what you see when we talked about it. In my comments that's why one of the things I stressed was what was happening with just line of business applications before any SaaS application ours or others the reality is the most usage in any enterprise is line of business applications that were built custom by that enterprise and their IT organizations for all the departments whether it's HR or finance or operations. That is really one of the bigger drivers of Teams usage as a platform capability. So you can think you brought up first line. There is some shift scheduling application, some inventory counting application that the frontline person is using on a mobile phone with Teams but the inventory management app was just a Power app built using Power apps so that is what you're seeing and then of course the integrations into dynamics, integrations into all SaaS applications whether it's workday or whether it's SAP or whether it is ServiceNow and even Salesforce all of these applications are getting integrated into Teams very rapidly and so that's the power of Teams as a platform capability that we're seeing and you're absolutely right that this is no longer about just knowledge workers collaborating. In fact, if anything it's about knowledge workers collaborating and enabling frontline workers with more of these work to participate with digital tools in the workflow versus being disconnected.",347.0,154.0,8.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05194805194805195,0.012987012987012988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03896103896103896

Amy do you see a sustainably different post-COVID expense profile for Microsoft as it relates to real estate footprint and T&E levels and maybe Satya you could perhaps comment on this as well.

I think the key thing Mark we just think about is there will be more flexibility in terms of time, where they work even, the site's people work because I think the expectations have changed. We obviously are not going to have the same constraints going forward. So I'm not at all assuming that we just remain as is all the way going forward. But at the same time there is no return to January of 2020. So therefore what I think is key for us is to really should maintain flexibility and that's why even going back to the conversation around Teams it's not like the work only happens in online meetings. Work happens before meetings, during meetings, after meetings and especially in hybrid work you need that sophisticated set of tools that really track workflow irrespective of who is where and so that's what we are focused on and in our own policies we have laid out of policies which give more flexibility and it'll be different by function, different by geography, different in time.

And so it's about continuing to invest in those places, looking and learning about the types of flexibility that we are able to provide our own employees, what travel patterns need to look like and of course will do what it takes to deliver success to customer which should be the driving force behind how we invest in that segment and finally as there is obviously lots of opportunity for us to continue to be flexible in how we work specifically which is where Satya talked about.

The way I look at it is there's a complete rethink on even if you take the previous conversation around what are the workflows that need to get integrated into a communications tools such that there is real continuity between frontlines to knowledge worker to business process. I think that opens up even a ton of opportunity. I mean take something like even digital twins and the level of automation that one can bring even into manufacturing. So the combination of an Azure pass service to SaaS capabilities in Dynamics 365 can be very transformative to digital manufacturing which is probably going to be one of the bigger trends going forward. Same thing in supply chain. So it's a pretty important area for us, business process and business applications participation if you will, will be both on the Azure side, on the data side, on the AI side and the biz apps side as well as Power apps. So it's not one narrow category because I think most people the way you measure business applications and the categories of business and applications is pretty narrow but business process is much broader than that and so that's I think at least what we are building towards.",224.0,107.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.009345794392523364,0.0,0.009345794392523364,0.0,0.0,0.009345794392523364

It was a record quarter powered by our continued strength of our commercial cloud. Over a year into the pandemic, digital adoption curves aren't slowing down. In fact, they're accelerating and it's just the beginning. Digital technology will be the foundation for resilience and growth over the next decade. We are innovating and building the cloud stack to accelerate the digital capability of every organization on the planet. Now, I'll highlight our growing opportunity and momentum starting with Azure. As the world's COGS become more digital, computing will become more ubiquitous and decentralized. We are building Azure to address organizations' needs in a multi-cloud multi-edge world. We have more data center regions than any other provider, including new regions in China, Indonesia, Malaysia as well as United States. Azure has always been hybrid by design and we are accelerating our innovation to meet customers where they are. Azure Arc extends the Azure control plane across on-premise, multi-cloud, and the edge and they're going further with Arc-enabled machine learning and Arc-enabled Kubernetes. Companies like Fujitsu and KPMG are using Arc to simplify hybrid management and run Azure data services anywhere. Our differentiation across the cloud and the edge is driving deeper and more strategic partnerships with leading companies in every industry from Total and Repsol and Energy to Kaiser Permanente in healthcare and Amadeus in travel. Now to data and analytics. Core to the competitiveness of every company going forward will be their ability to turn data into predictive and analytical power. The next-generation analytics service, Azure Synapse, accelerates time to insight by bringing together, data integration, enterprise data warehousing and big data analytics into one unified service. No other provider offers the limitless scale, price performance and deep integrations of Synapse. With Spark integration, for example, organizations can handle large-scale data processing workloads. With Azure machine learning, they can build advanced AI models. With Power BI, anyone in the organization can access insights. We are seeing adoption from thousands of customers, including AB InBev, Dentsu and Swiss Re. Queries performed using Synapse have increased 105% over the last quarter alone. We are leading in hyperscale SQL and non-SQL databases to support the increasing volume variety and velocity of data. Customers continue to choose Azure for their relational database workloads with SQL Server on Azure VMs use, up 129% year-over-year. And Cosmos DB is the database of choice for cloud-native app development at any scale. Transaction volume increased 170% year-over-year. Now on to developers. As every organization looks to build its own digital capability, they will need to modernize existing apps, build new apps and have a standard way of doing both. We offer the most popular tools to help developers rapidly grow from idea to code and code to cloud. Visual Studio has more than 25 million monthly active users and GitHub is home to nearly 65 million developers. Over the past 12 months, the number of monthly active organizations using GitHub increased 70%. In fact, some of the most groundbreaking technological achievements of the past year, including critical COVID-19 vaccine trials, as well as the first powered flight on Mars were only possible because of the contributions of the open-source communities on GitHub. At the PaaS layer, we are innovating to help developers infuse AI into the solutions they build. Large-scale AI models are becoming platforms and we've seen dramatic advances in research and development by OpenAI whose models are trained and hosted exclusively on Azure. GPT-3 is generating 4.5 billion words per day on average with hundreds of apps in production across a range of industries. With Azure Cognitive Services, organizations can build applications that see, hear, speak, search, understand and accelerate decision-making. New capabilities enable developers to add semantic search to their apps and help companies like AT&T, Duolingo and Progressive build custom neural voices for their products. And we're doing -- going further with Azure Percept, a complete platform from silicon to service, which simplifies the process of developing, training and deploying AI at the edge. As the virtual and physical worlds converge, the metaverse comprised of digital twins, simulated environments and mixed reality is emerging as a first-class platform. We are leading and seeing traction across public and private sector. Bentley Systems is building a digital twin of the city of Dublin to reimagine urban planning used our Azure Digital Twins as well as Azure IoT. PepsiCo is simulating its manufacturing processes to improve product consistency using our autonomous systems platform. And from Airbus and Toyota to L'Oreal and Intel, customers in every industry are transcending space and addressing complex challenges using mixed reality. The U.S. Army, for example, will use HoloLens-based headset augmented with our cloud services. The new Microsoft Mesh builds on this momentum allowing for holographic interactions with true presence in a natural way on any device. We've already seen early adoption by Accenture, which is using mesh to build immersive virtual office experiences. Power Platform is becoming the next-generation business process automation and productivity suite for domain experts in all functions. We have taken a unique approach to what is an expansive and high-growth TAM, bringing together robotic process automation, low-code, no-code tools, virtual agents and business intelligence. Using power platform and domain -- any domain experts can automate a workflow, create an app, build a virtual agent or analyze data rapidly driving productivity gains across the organization through smart automation. Just like Office-revolutionized productivity gains for knowledge workers, Power Platform will do the same for domain experts. All up Power, Platform is being used by nearly 16 million monthly active users, up 97% year-over-year. Revenue increased 84% year-over-year. Telstra, T-Mobile, Toyota North America and Unilever have all built centers of excellence for Power Platform with thousands of workers who are using those low-code, no-code tools to build apps and workflows for everything from COVID-19 screening to product quality control. In robotic process automation, Coca-Cola saved months of development time by integrating Power Automate with legacy systems to automate shipment verification, payroll processing and much more. And in analytics, Daimler chose Power BI to surface insights across the organization, while maintaining the highest levels of security. Now on to business applications. Dynamics 365 had a breakthrough quarter as companies turn to intelligent business applications to adapt and grow. Revenue increased 45% as we continue to take share from competition. We are adding capabilities across Dynamics 365 to address organization's most pressing challenges. New integrations with Teams make it simple to meet, chat, call and collaborate directly within Dynamics 365. A new Dynamics 365 Intelligent Order Management helps company’s support omnichannel fulfillment. We are seeing increased adoption of Dynamics 365 across every industry from ABN AMRO in Financial Services to BMW in automotive. More broadly across the Microsoft Cloud, we are leading with industry and cross-industry solutions and expanding our investments to help organizations use our complete tech stack along with industry specific customizations to improve time to value, increase agility and lower costs. This quarter we introduced new industry clouds for financial services, manufacturing and nonprofits, building on the momentum of existing clouds for health care and retail. And our pending acquisition of Nuance will bring our solutions directly into the physician patient loop, which is central to health care delivery. Now on to LinkedIn. We once again saw record engagement as LinkedIn's 756 million members use the network to connect, learn, create content, and find jobs. Conversations increased 43%, content share was up 29%, and the hours on LinkedIn increased by 80%. We are helping creators use LinkedIn to expand their economic opportunity, thousands of expert instructors are monetizing their content on LinkedIn Learning. Freelancers can now attract clients with dedicated pages. And with the creator mode, members can build a following and engaged communities. In a world facing a growing skills gap, we are helping employers create feedback loops between skills, learning, credentials, and jobs. 60% of the Fortune 500 use LinkedIn Learning to skill and upskill their employees. Nationwide Insurance, for example, is using LinkedIn Learning to provide personalized curriculum to 26,000 associates. And new tools bring together courses with skills assessments helping companies like BlackRock, Gap and TaskRabbit source job candidates based on proven proficiencies. Businesses continue to turn to LinkedIn as the trusted way to reach professionals ready to do business. LinkedIn Marketing Solutions revenue was up more than 60% year-over-year. Over the past 12 months revenue has surpassed $3 billion and is growing nearly three times faster than the B2B digital advertising market. Now on to Microsoft 365 and Teams. Hybrid work will require a new operating model. That's why we built Teams as the organizing layer for all the way people work, learn, and collaborate. Teams now has over 145 million daily active users, almost double the number a year ago. In markets where employees have returned to the workplace including Australia, China, New Zealand, South Korea and Taiwan we have seen usage continue to grow. And the number of organizations with more than 1,000 users integrating their third-party and line of business applications with Teams has increased nearly 3x year-over-year. We're accelerating our innovation, adding more than 300 features over the past year including more than a hundred new capabilities so far in 2021. New inclusive meeting experience for hybrid work including custom gallery views enable anyone to be seen, heard and participate whether they are at-home, in a meeting room, at an office or on a factory floor. And customers like GM and Sanofi are using Teams for unified communications including for voice. Teams is extending beyond communications, creating an entirely new category of modern collaborative applications as organizations use Power Platform to build custom apps, bots and workflows within teams. American Airlines, for example, highlighted in their earnings call the cost savings it's driving by using a Power app within Teams to help their frontline workers manage critical data operations. Teams is transforming not only internal collaboration, but companies how they do business. We added support for shared workspaces with people outside the organization and we are seeing Teams used for everything from virtual retail showrooms and personal shopping to interactive webinars. We introduced Microsoft Viva this quarter creating a new market category for employee experience. Viva brings together knowledge, learning, communication and insights in an integrated experience directly within Teams and Microsoft 365. Companies like Coca-Cola and Unilever will use Viva to help their employees thrive in a new era of hybrid work. All up Microsoft 365 users generated more than 38 billion collaboration minutes in a single day this quarter. Office 365 now has nearly 300 million paid seats. And organizations across the private and public sector like the City of Helsinki, Bausch Health, Stryker are increasingly choosing our premium offerings for advanced security, compliance voice and analytics. People are turning to Windows PCs more than ever to stay connected productive and secure. Windows 10 now has more than 1.3 billion monthly active devices and Microsoft 365 consumer surpassed 50 million subscribers for the first time. Now on to security. The threat landscape has never been more complex or challenging and security has never been more critical to our customers. This is driving increased demand for our end-to-end capabilities across identity, security compliance and management backed by cloud-scale AI and human expertise encompassing all clouds and all platforms. What differentiates us and drives customer value is the interconnection between identity endpoint apps, cloud data and infrastructure across our cloud-native XDR and SIEM. All informed by our operational security posture, which analyzes more than eight trillion signals each day. Our approach enables organizations to adopt a Zero Trust architecture, while also reducing the complexity cost and risk created by stitching together point solutions. That's why more than 400,000 customers use our offerings including many of the world's most established firms like Boston Consulting Group, HCA Healthcare, Lowe's and UBS. And Signal is using Azure Confidential Computing to protect the data and use for its millions of customers. We are going further to help protect organizations. We are delivering on our ambition to eliminate passwords introducing password-less sign-in to Azure AD. Our Azure AD paid customer base has more than doubled year-over-year to over 300,000, new capabilities in Microsoft 365 Defender help organizations better understand, prevent and mitigate active threats. Defender has blocked 30 billion threats on e-mail and nearly seven billion on endpoints over the past 12 months alone. And our compliance manager now offers more than 300 out-of-the-box assessments for regulations such as GDPR. Now on to gaming. We're expanding our opportunity as we help both gamers and creators play, connect and build across communities on any device. People are turning to Xbox more than ever to play and chat with friends and we saw record engagement this quarter led by the strength on and off console. With Game Pass we are redefining how games are distributed played and viewed. Just last week we added cloud gaming via the browser expanding our reach across PC and mobile. Content is the flywheel behind the services growth. And upon the closing of our acquisition of ZeniMax Media this quarter we made 20 of the world's most iconic and beloved games accessible via Game Pass with more to come. As games evolve into metaverse economies, we are building new tools to help anyone sell creations on our platform. Minecraft is nearly 140 million monthly active users up 30% year-over-year making it one of the leading platforms in the creator economy. Creators have generated over $350 million from more than one billion downloads of mods, add-ons and other experiences in Minecraft. This is not counting and including activity outside of our marketplace. We are also seeing a vibrant marketplace emerge in Flight Simulator with partners now able to sell content directly within the game. In closing, we're innovating across the entire tech stack as we differentiate and lead in areas that will be critical to the success of every customer going forward. I'm optimistic about our opportunity ahead. With that I'll hand it over to Amy who will cover our financial results in detail and share our outlook and I look forward to rejoining you for questions.",2396.0,1374.0,45.0,9.0,12.0,1.0,2.0,15.0,9.0,2.0,0.03275109170305677,0.006550218340611353,0.008733624454148471,0.000727802037845706,0.001455604075691412,0.026200873362445413

My comments today reflect the impact of the ZeniMax acquisition for approximately three weeks this quarter as well as our outlook. There is no impact from the Nuance acquisition that is expected to close by the end of the calendar year. Our third quarter revenue was $41.7 billion, up 19% and 16% in constant currency and earnings per share was $1.95 and increased 39% and 34% in constant currency when adjusted for the tax benefit related to the recent India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes. Many trends across industries, customer segments, and geographical markets continued to improve, which coupled with strong execution by our sales and partner teams, drove another quarter of double-digit top and bottom-line growth. In our commercial business accelerating digital transformation enabled by our unique Microsoft Cloud value, drove healthy demand for our hybrid and cloud offerings. Strong Azure consumption, increased platform commitments, and higher usage of Teams Power Platform and our security offerings were key beneficiaries. Within our small and medium business customer segment, continued improvement in cloud purchasing trends more than offset transactional licensing weakness. And in LinkedIn's Talent Solutions business, annual contracts and job postings improved with the job market. In our consumer business, Windows OEM and Microsoft 365 consumer subscriptions benefited from a much stronger than expected PC market despite significant ongoing constraints in the supply chain. Improvement in the advertising market again benefited our Search and LinkedIn businesses and in gaming, we continue to see record engagement and strong monetization across our platform as well as demand that significantly exceeded supply for Xbox Series X and S consoles. Moving to our overall results, commercial bookings growth was ahead of expectations increasing 39% and 38% in constant currency on a growing expiration base and low prior year comparable. Growth was driven by consistent execution across our core annuity sales motions and an increase in the number of larger long-term Azure contracts. As a result, commercial remaining performance obligation increased 31% and 32% in constant currency to $117 billion with a roughly equivalent split between the revenue that will be recognized within and the portion beyond the next 12 months and our annuity mix increased two points year-over-year to 94%. Commercial cloud revenue also better than expected grew 33% and 29% in constant currency to $17.7 billion. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage expanded three points year-over-year to 70%, driven by the change in accounting estimate for the useful life of server and network equipment assets. Excluding this impact, commercial cloud gross margin percentage was up slightly with improvement in Azure gross margin mostly offset by sales mix shift to Azure. With a weaker US dollar, FX increased revenue growth by approximately three points about one point more favorable than anticipated. FX increased COGS and operating expense growth by approximately two points, both in line with expectations. Gross margin dollars increased 19% and 16% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage was 69% relatively unchanged year-over-year with roughly one point of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate noted earlier. Excluding this impact, company gross margin percentage was down, driven by strong revenue growth in cloud and gaming that resulted in sales mix shift. Operating expense increased 5% and 3% in constant currency, lower than anticipated, primarily driven by investments that shifted to future quarters. Overall, company headcount grew again this quarter up 12% year-over-year, reflecting our focused investments across key areas like cloud engineering, sales, and customer deployment. Year-over-year growth in operating expense includes roughly two points of impact from continued COVID-related savings. Operating income increased 31% and 27% in constant currency and operating margins expanded four points year-over-year to 41% including nearly two points of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate and roughly one point of favorable impact from COVID-related savings. Now to our segment results. Revenue from productivity and business processes was $13.6 billion and grew 15% and 12% in constant currency, primarily driven by Office 365 and LinkedIn. Office Commercial revenue grew 14% and 10% in constant currency. Office 365 Commercial revenue grew 22% and 19% in constant currency, again driven by installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments as well as higher ARPU. Demand for our high-value security, compliance and voice offerings drove strong momentum in E5 again this quarter. Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 15% year-over-year to nearly $300 million with acceleration to the cloud in our small and medium business segment and a recovery in growth in our first-line worker offerings. The accelerated cloud adoption, negatively impacted Office Commercial licensing, which declined 25% and 27% in constant currency, a bit below expectations. In Office Consumer, revenue grew 5% and 2% in constant currency, slightly below expectations, primarily due to transactional weakness in Japan. Microsoft 365 consumer subscriptions grew to $50.2 million, up 27% year-over-year. Dynamics revenue grew 26% and 22% in constant currency, better than expected, driven by Dynamics 365 revenue growth accelerating to 45% and 40% in constant currency with particular strength in Power Apps in our finance and operations offering. LinkedIn revenue increased 25% and 23% in constant currency, ahead of expectations. Our Marketing Solutions business accelerated again this quarter to 64% revenue growth. Segment gross margin dollars increased 15% and 12% in constant currency and gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged year-over-year with nearly 2 points of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate. Operating expense increased 4% and 2% in constant currency and operating income increased 26% and 20% in constant currency including 4 points due to the change in accounting estimate. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $15.1 billion, ahead of expectations, increasing 23% and 20% in constant currency. Server products and cloud services revenue increased 26% and 23% in constant currency, ahead of expectations. Azure revenue grew 50% and 46% in constant currency, better than anticipated, driven by continued strength in our consumption-based business. And in our per user business growth in our Enterprise Mobility and Security installed base accelerated again this quarter, up 30% to over 174 million seats. And on a strong prior year comparable that benefited from the end of support for Windows Server 2008, our on-premise's server business increased 3% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency with strong annuity performance, driven by continued customer preference for our hybrid and premium offerings. Enterprise Services revenue grew 10% and 8% in constant currency with better-than-expected performance in Microsoft Consulting Services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 27% to 24% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage increased 2 points year-over-year with roughly 2 points of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate. Operating expense increased 12% and 10% in constant currency and operating income grew 41% and 36% in constant currency with roughly 7 points of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $13 billion increasing 19% and 16% in constant currency with better-than-expected performance in gaming, Windows OEM and Search. In Windows, the stronger PC market resulted in overall OEM revenue growth of 10%, driven by continued customer demand. OEM non-Pro revenue grew 44% and OEM Pro revenue declined 2% on a prior year comparable that included the end of support for Windows 7. Windows commercial products and cloud services grew 10% and 7% in constant currency with a lower-than-expected mix of in-quarter recognition from multiyear agreements. In Surface, revenue grew 12% and 7% in constant currency lower than expected, primarily due to execution challenges in the commercial segment. Search revenue ex TAC increased 17% and 14% in constant currency benefiting from the improved advertising market noted earlier.  And in Gaming, revenue increased 50% and 48% in constant currency. Xbox hardware revenue grew 232% and 223% in constant currency driven by our new consoles. Xbox content and services revenue, which now includes ZeniMax grew 34% and 32% in constant currency with better-than-expected performance of first-party titles, particularly Minecraft.  Segment gross margin dollars increased 14% and 11% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage decreased two points year-over-year driven by sales mix shift to gaming. Operating expense decreased 3% and 4% in constant currency and operating income grew 27% and 22% in constant currency.  Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures including finance leases were $6 billion in line with expectations driven by ongoing investment to support growing global demand from increased customer usage of our cloud services. Cash paid for PP&E was $5.1 billion. Cash flow from operations was $22.2 billion and increased 27% year-over-year driven by strong cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $17.1 billion, up 24%. Other income and expense was $188 million higher than anticipated, primarily driven by net gains on investments. As a reminder, we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was approximately 14%. And finally, we returned $10 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.  Now let's move to the outlook. As a reminder in Q4, we begin to see growth rates that reflect the first full quarter impact of COVID-19 a year ago both across revenue and operating expenses. Last year across Windows, OEM, Gaming and Surface we saw surges in purchasing and usage that will negatively impact Q4 growth rates.  In our Search and LinkedIn businesses, Q4 growth rates will be positively impacted given the advertising and job markets a year ago. And in our transactional business, the slowdown in purchasing in Office and Server last year will benefit Q4 growth rates, particularly in our small and medium business segment.  Next in our largest quarter of the year, we expect the accelerating trends Satya discussed, our differentiated market position and continued solid execution to results in another strong quarter. Growth in commercial bookings should again be healthy, but impacted by a declining expiry base. As always, an increasing mix of larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing can drive quarterly volatility in bookings.  Commercial cloud gross margin percentage should increase roughly four points year-over-year with less than two points from the change in accounting estimate. As a reminder, the favorable impact continues to lessen over time. Excluding the accounting change, Q4 gross margin percentage will also benefit a bit from investments we made a year ago to support increased usage needs in remote work scenarios.  Longer term commercial cloud gross margin percentage will continue to be impacted by revenue mix shift to Azure, increased usage of our productivity and collab solutions and ongoing strategic investments to support our customers' success. In capital expenditures, we expect a sequential increase on a dollar basis as we continue to invest to meet growing global demand for our cloud services.  Now to FX. Based on current rates, we expect FX to increase total company Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud revenue growth by approximately three points, More Personal Computing revenue and total operating expense growth by approximately two points and COGS growth by approximately one point.  Next to our segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $13.8 billion and $14.05 billion. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with healthy seat growth and upsell opportunity to E5.  In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the high teens consistent with the ongoing customer shift to the cloud. In Office consumer, we expect mid to high teens revenue growth driven by continued momentum in Microsoft 365 consumer subscriptions against the low prior year comparable impacted by the transactional purchasing weakness noted earlier.  In LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the mid-30% range, driven by continued strong engagement on the platform and improvements in the advertising and job markets. And in Dynamics, continued momentum in Dynamics 365 will drive revenue growth similar to last quarter. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $16.2 billion and $16.45 billion. In Azure, revenue will again be driven by strong growth in our consumption-based business. And our per user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect some moderation in growth rates given the size of the installed base. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits, driven by continued demand for our hybrid and premium annuity offerings against a low prior year comparable and the transactional purchasing noted earlier. And in Enterprise Services, revenue growth to be roughly in line with last quarter. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $13.6 billion and $14 billion. In Windows, overall revenue should grow mid-single digits driven by Windows Commercial products and cloud services growth and continued demand for PCs, partially offset by ongoing supply chain impacts and the comparable noted earlier. In Surface on a strong prior year comparable, we expect revenue to decline in the mid-teens as we work through the supply chain and executing challenges noted earlier. In Search ex TAC, we expect revenue growth in the mid-40s driven by improvements in the advertising market. In gaming, we expect revenue growth in the mid- to high single-digits. Significant demand for the Xbox Series X and S will continue to be constrained by supply. And on the strong prior year comparable, we expect Xbox content and services revenue to decline in the mid- to high single-digits. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS of $13.7 billion to $13.9 billion and operating expense of $13.1 billion to $13.2 billion. As a reminder, in operating expense in Q4, we will benefit from continued COVID-related savings as well as the prior year comparable, which included roughly four points of impact from a $450 million charge related to the realignment of our retail store strategy. In other income and expense, interest income and expense should offset each other. And finally, we expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be approximately 16%. Now I'd like to share some closing thoughts as we look to next fiscal year. Overall, we have performed well through three quarters of our fiscal year in a challenging environment, and we fully expect a strong Q4 to lay the foundation for FY 2022. We will, of course, continue to focus on delivering strong revenue growth in the short term. But even more importantly, this year has reinforced the critical importance of investing boldly to capture the significant list of opportunities ahead of us. Excellence in daily execution, coupled with a thoughtful vision for the future that creates value as well as opportunity for our customers globally will lead to long-term revenue and profit growth. With that, Brett, let's go to Q&A.",2366.0,1478.0,56.0,21.0,26.0,5.0,5.0,14.0,3.0,7.0,0.037889039242219216,0.014208389715832206,0.017591339648173207,0.0033829499323410014,0.0033829499323410014,0.02368064952638701

I guess this is a question both for Satya and Amy. We're seeing these really great commercial bookings results come through 39% growth in the current quarter. And Satya, you've been talking to us a lot about these more strategic deals and the acceleration of digital transformation. Can you give us a little bit of color of what comes in these more strategic deals? How does it change the dynamics of what types of solutions people are using for Microsoft, the scope of sort of how deeply you're getting into these customers and sort of how much of the IT budget you're getting? And then maybe talk to us a little bit about the timeframe for which this comes into revenues. What should our expectation be when you get one of these big strategic deals? How long does it take to really ramp up this customer onto the broader Microsoft platform?",165.0,75.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.013333333333333334,0.02666666666666667,0.013333333333333334,0.0,0.0,-0.013333333333333334

I think we feel very good both, I would say, of consumption and usage today, as well as, as you mentioned, the bookings because both of those at any given point in time is what we look at. The overall approach to the Microsoft Cloud, if you look at the breadth of what any customer may be doing with us, they may be doing hybrid cloud infrastructure with us. They may be, for the first time, doing Tier 1 workloads on the cloud with us, right, whether it's in core financials or in retail or in health care. Also they could be deploying their centers of excellence around Power Platform. And Power Platform sits at the intersection of pretty much Dynamics, Azure and Teams, for example. And of course, we're seeing the growth of Teams and Teams, as I've always maintained, is not just about one thing. It's not about just meetings or it's not about just chat. But most importantly, it's a platform that drives in fact line of business and business application termination inside of a collaboration workflow. And so that's what we're seeing. And then the other thing I would say that we are now seeing is also that industry level differentiation of the all-up Microsoft cloud. So whether it's in retail, whether it's in healthcare or in financial services, we feel that we now can bring the power of the entire cloud together in a much more strategic way.",259.0,112.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.026785714285714284,0.017857142857142856,0.03571428571428571,0.0,0.0,0.008928571428571428

But really, the foundation for these long-term strategic contracts is the Microsoft Cloud holistically. So what you'll see is not just Office 365, but the suite of Microsoft 365. You'll see higher-level additions of security or compliance workloads. You'll see Dynamics 365 as a pillar with Power Platform, because they're spanning end-to-end industry solutions to combine it back to what Satya is saying. So you see it add a good bookings number, which is fundamentally about, do you renew what's up for renewal, do you add workloads, do you add users and do you -- and does it have a component of an Azure commitment. All of those things together are what creates this change. And if you look at remaining performance obligation, you see there a good bit of it, that's going to be recognized in the next 12 months and another equally balanced portion that's beyond that. So it's not all long-term. This transition happens quickly, usage builds, it's both per user, it's also for workload and it's consumptive based. So it's really a more holistic view that I would have people take as opposed to thinking about an Azure contract as long dated.",260.0,114.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.017543859649122806,0.017543859649122806,0.017543859649122806,0.02631578947368421,0.02631578947368421,0.0

When I look at the industry cloud opportunities, we think of healthcare is a very critical opportunity for us and a huge and expansive addressable market. If you think about as a percentage of GDP, obviously, healthcare is significant. And fundamentally, when I think about the provider market, in particular, digital tech is going to play a huge role for every provider to do the things that they care the most about, which is improve the patient outcomes and reduce cost and reduce the burden on the physicians. So that's where the Nuance acquisition is a great fit for us. We've been partnered with them. It also enhances our platform approach, Brent. What we have always done has gone into an industry with a platform and an ecosystem approach. For example, with Nuance, they've done a fantastic job of taking what's perhaps the most defining technology of our times, which is AI and applying it to healthcare, which is the most important application space. And they've done that again by really partnering, partnering deeply with EMR systems and the rest of the healthcare ecosystem ultimately to benefit the providers. And so we're really looking forward to that acquisition closing and we're already partnered with them in our cloud. But this allows us to take that and integrate more deeply with what we're doing with Teams and some of our AI capabilities even more deeply. And we think we can add a significant amount of value both to our partners in the healthcare ecosystem as well as most importantly to the providers.",275.0,119.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,0.04201680672268908,0.01680672268907563,0.008403361344537815,0.0,0.0,0.025210084033613446

I'd like to change gear a little bit and drill in a bit on the Dynamics 365 business. Frankly, was this part of any other company or even a standalone business, it would be such a center of enthusiasm by investors given how fast it's grown.

And first of all, we're very, very excited about what's happening again with Dynamics 365. And when you ask where is the share coming and where is the growth coming? It's coming from all those categories. But the most interesting thing is, as somebody wants to deploy even an omni-channel solution, for example, in a world where what's physical and what is digital need to come together, unlike anything before because the pandemic is bringing about such structural change. You need both, that federated inventory management, distributed inventory management system I referenced in my remarks. And you need the customer insights product that is probably one of the fastest-growing modules, which is that 360-degree view on customers and customer engagement and then including the supply chain. So bottom line is that, every customer is looking to digitize and bring together the data silos, in fact, silos of CRM and ERP systems. And that's probably one of the most interesting things we have observed is, it's not about replacing even an existing ERP or an existing CRM, it's about buying Dynamics and helping them bridge even some of the disparate CRM and ERP systems they may have. So we do see this, as a huge opportunity as the world modernizes and puts in a complete next-generation, more proactive versus reactive business systems. And that's what Dynamics has been architected for.

Amy the OpEx growth has been extraordinarily low the last several quarters. The growth rate looks like it's going to inch up a little bit in the June quarter. But you mentioned the investments are shifting to future quarters. You probably don't want to give too much on fiscal 2022. But I'm just wondering whether we should extrapolate that into thinking that OpEx growth in fiscal 2022 should get back to the pre-COVID levels of plus 10%.

And I do think in Q4, and its why, I specifically called out the four points of impact from a year ago because it does start to get to a more normalized rate in Q4. And I say that, because our headcount growth which I noted earlier has been 12%. And so, overall, you would expect, OpEx growth to at least marry your headcount growth over any period of time and we've certainly benefited through the year from COVID-related savings. We'll continue to have that in Q4. And as we get to 2022, I would expect to see a little less of that as people get back to the workplace at some level and resume some other normal levels of activity. And so, I do think, you're heading in the right direction on that. And listen, I think that type of growth with the type of opportunity we're seeing, the number of TAM expansive opportunities really Satya went through in his comments, where we feel like we've got a unique position and opportunity to take share.

It's very much a great example of what I was saying in terms of creating a new category right. When I look back multiple years now, we started talking about Power Platform. And as I said even in my script today, we now have a full suite of tools that essentially created this next-generation business, process automation and productivity suite in Power Platform that set scale and growing at scale. Similarly, we think of the experience cloud as a distinct cloud opportunity for us. It brings together even today what have been disparate tools, whether it's the knowledge mining and management systems in an enterprise, connecting it to learnings and ultimately the employee experience and communication system.

One is, we need to be competitive in each layer and then the coming together of each layer into a cohesive coherent architecture of the full stack or the Microsoft cloud creates that differentiation. And that will define what we think is going to be increasing share for us, as tech itself as a percentage of GDP doubles. So if you look at it -- whether it's on the hybrid infrastructure or the multi-cloud, multi-edge world, which I believe is going to be the world 10 years from now, we are very well positioned. We have led in it we currently lead in it and we plan to continue that. When it comes to data when I look at even what we've been able to do with Synapse even in the just last year and what that can do both at the cloud and the edge. When it comes to AI what we are doing with OpenAI and our cognitive services or what we're doing with Power Platform. Developer SaaS one of the most exciting things again, that I believe is the next 10 years is going to be about developers and the digital capability in every enterprise and we are the leaders there. When you think about VS Code as well as GitHub. And then, of course, all of the things that we're doing with Microsoft 365 and Dynamics on the industry side. So, ultimately, we don't take anything for granted.

We absolutely think that ultimately, customers are looking to increase their time to value lower cost and improve agility. So being able to customize these workflows, to come up with industry schemers because when you think about increased digitization and workflow automation, it does take that next level of schematization of what is perhaps today not digital inside an industry. And so therefore, what we do by stitching together, coming together of even Microsoft 365, Teams, Power Platform with certain workflows, with data inside of Azure, as well as Dynamics, that absolutely improves the ability for any customer in any one of these industries to improve their time to value.

Obviously, security is a super important topic for every customer, every board, every executive team. And the fundamental approach we have is, how do we ensure that every customer has implemented a zero trust architecture. But that's the name of the game which is, how can Microsoft through participation in the security industry, accelerate essentially the cyber defense of the entire digital factor and beyond. And so to me, what we have done is taken a pretty unique approach of bringing identity, endpoint application, infrastructure all together with XDR and SIM, which is cloud native. That's pretty unique because we really don't let the get in the way. We'll make sure that any customer who is able to sort of deploy these systems together has more defense in depth, but also the aggregate data to be able to detect and respond to any intrusion because that's sort of the key posture. And then you couple that with our operational security posture when you're processing 8 trillion events and using that to continuously help our customers is increasing to your point, the cloud adoption rate. So if you look at some of the challenges like HAFNIUM, the cloud was not impacted. And when we did sort of a lot of work to make sure that the patches were out even for servers that were out of support for multiple years. And so -- but at the same time, any business that had moved already to the cloud had none of those issues. So, therefore, I think we are going to see increased cloud adoption. We're going to see increased usage of end-to-end security suites like what we offer.

We’re the only cloud provider with the capability to support every organization’s multi-cloud, hybrid and edge needs. Over the past year we have added new data center regions in 15 countries across five continents, delivering faster access to cloud services and addressing data residency requirements. And now, we’re taking cloud compute to the edge with 5G deployments. Our new Azure edge services help operators and enterprises deliver ultra-low-latency compute fabric. And we’re also helping operators run their networks in the cloud. AT&T chose Azure to power its 5G core network, making it the first Tier 1 operator to move its existing customer traffic to the public cloud. We’re also expanding our opportunity in hybrid. Today over 75% of the Fortune 500 use our hybrid offerings. Azure Arc extends the Azure control plane across on-premise multi-cloud and the edge. With Arc, customers like EY and Telstra can manage their Kubernetes deployments anywhere and deploy Azure SQL databases and run Azure application services on any infrastructure. As the digital and physical worlds converge, we are leading in a new layer of the infrastructure stack, the enterprise metaverse. AB InBev is using our solutions, including Azure Digital Twins and Azure IoT to optimize operations from the barley field to the warehouse, to distribution. Customers also continue to choose our infrastructure to run mission-critical SAP solutions. Thousands of enterprises have migrated their ERP workloads to Azure, including Campbell Soup, L’Oréal, Mondelēz International, ServiceNow and even SAP. All this innovation is driving larger and more strategic Azure commitments from industry leaders, including Mars in consumer goods, Morgan Stanley in financial services and NEC in IT. Now, on to data. Data is the most strategic asset for every business. We’re the only cloud provider that helps organizations build sovereignty over their data by bringing together hyperscale, OLTP, analytics and governance workloads. Cosmos DB has become the go-to database, powering the world’s most demanding mission-critical workloads. New capabilities help organizations like Albertsons, ASOS, DHL, LaLiga, Maersk, Swiss Re optimize cost and boost performance. Walmart is using Cosmos DB to handle billions of online requests daily and to ensure millions of customers receive the items they want when they need them. Azure Synapse brings together data integration, big data and data warehouses into a single service. From ABN AMRO in finance and AmerisourceBergen in pharma to Walgreens in retail and WPP in advertising, organizations are using Synapse to generate insights from massive amounts of structured and unstructured data. Queries performed using Synapse increased 146% over the last quarter alone. Now on to developers. GitHub is used by 72% of the Fortune 50 to build, ship, and maintain software. Organizations like Ford, NASA and Shopify are using new project planning capabilities to help developers better manage projects directly within their workflow. And Epic Games, Motorola Solutions and Volkswagen Software Group all chose GitHub Advanced Security this quarter to help secure their code. We’re also leading in enterprise AI. Our new Azure Applied AI Services help organizations like Dow, Lufthansa and Samsung apply AI to common business scenarios. And live captions in Twitter Spaces are being powered by our speech services. Finally, we are bringing the power of our partnership with OpenAI to both professional developers and domain experts. With GitHub Copilot, professional developers can write code faster with less work and using the world’s most powerful language model, GPT-3, domain experts can build apps using natural language with Power Platform. Power Platform has become the leading business process automation and productivity suite for domain experts across all functions. Power BI is the leader in business intelligence in the cloud. Organizations in every industry, including Bayer, Cerner, Rolls-Royce are choosing the platform to foster a data-driven culture. The number of organizations using Power Apps has more than doubled year-over-year. BASF chose Power Apps to give 122,000 employees the capability to build low-code no-code apps. And the Toyota Fusion teams of pro developers and domain experts are using Power Apps and Azure Pass services to improve quality control. All up, Power Platform revenue increased 83% over the past year. And now, on to Dynamics 365. Every business function, including marketing, sales, customer support and supply chain will need to be re-imagined for an AI-first and collaboration-first world. And the silos between communications, collaboration and business process have to be broken down. With Dynamics 365, we are building a new generation of business applications to help organizations adapt to this new reality. We continue to gain share. Dynamics 365 revenue accelerated for the third consecutive quarter, up 49% year-over-year. We are helping businesses to become digitally sovereign over their customer interactions with our customer insights product with organizations like Columbia Sportswear, GNC and LA Clippers all choosing to unify customer profiles and deliver more personalized experiences. We are empowering employees for hybrid work by creating a new category of collaborative applications, bringing business process directly into the flow of work. New integrations between Dynamics 365 and Teams enable anyone in an organization to seamlessly view and collaborate on customer records within Teams without having to purchase multiple licenses. Customers want this and no other vendor is doing this today. And we are helping organizations re-imagine their core business process with new apps built for an age of omnichannel communications. With Dynamics 365, customer service organizations like Coca-Cola, Renault and Xiaomi have a single comprehensive solution to deliver consistent and personalized support across all channels. Now on to industry solutions. Over the past year, we have introduced industry clouds for financial services, health care, manufacturing, nonprofits and retail. And this quarter, we announced our new Microsoft Cloud for sustainability, bringing together capabilities across our stack to create an entirely new business process category to help every organization address this very urgent need. Now, on to LinkedIn. LinkedIn’s revenue surpassed $10 billion for the first time this fiscal year, up 27%, a testament to how mission-critical the platform has become to help people connect, learn, grow and get hired over the course of their careers. In the past five years since our acquisition, revenue has nearly tripled and growth has accelerated. LinkedIn has become a leader across multiple secular growth areas spanning B2B advertising, professional hiring, corporate learning and sales intelligence. And from LinkedIn profiles within Office to LinkedIn Learning courses within Microsoft Viva and LinkedIn Sales Navigator leads within Microsoft Dynamics 365, we have brought together the power of LinkedIn and Microsoft to transform how people learn, sell and connect. LinkedIn has more than 774 million members who are more engaged than ever. Sessions were up 30% this quarter compared to a year ago. And LinkedIn’s advertising business surpassed $1 billion in revenue this quarter for the first time, up 97% year-over-year, growing 3 times faster than the category. Now to Microsoft 365 and Teams. Hybrid work represents the biggest change to the way we work in a generation and will require a new operating model spanning people, places and processes. We’re the only cloud that supports everything an organization needs to successfully make the shift. Microsoft Teams is the new front end. It’s where people meet, chat, call, collaborate and automate business processes all within the flow of work. Teams usage has never been higher. We are nearly 250 million monthly active users as people use Teams each day to communicate, collaborate and co-author content across work, life and learning. We are leading in the new and growing enterprise phone category. Just like video meetings, chat and business processes happen in Teams, calls happen in Teams, creating a huge new opportunity. We have nearly 80 million monthly active Teams phones users, with total calls surpassing 1 billion in a single month this quarter, and we’re just getting started. Teams is also at the center of orchestrating collaboration across the entire SaaS estate from HR to marketing to finance. Leading third-party SaaS vendors, including Adobe, Atlassian, Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow and Workday have now built apps that deeply integrate with Teams, bringing every business process and function directly into the flow of work. And we are bringing Teams to consumers, so people can connect and collaborate with family and friends across desktop, mobile and the web. All this innovation is driving growth. 124 organizations now have more than 100,000 users of Teams, and nearly 3,000 have more than 10,000 users. More broadly, across Microsoft 365, we are seeing double-digit year-over-year seat growth in every segment from frontline and small business to enterprise. Leading companies like Bayer, Siemens, Vodafone, all chose our premium E5 offerings for advanced security, compliance, voice and analytics. Now on to employee experience cloud. Having a digital employee experience platform is critical for every organization. With Microsoft Viva, we are creating an entirely new category, bringing together communications, learning, well-being and knowledge directly into the flow of work. New capabilities empower leaders to build human capital, nurture wellbeing and focus on employee results. We are seeing strong interest and early adoption in every industry from American Express and Barclays to AT&T and Mars. Humana chose Viva to help 26,000 employees make the shift to hybrid work, gaining insights on everything from collaboration trends to manager effectiveness. Now on to Windows. Windows 11 is the biggest update to our operating system in a decade. We are reimagining everything from the Windows platform to the Store to help people and organizations be more productive and secure and build a more open ecosystem for developers and creators. We are delighted by early feedback. More people have downloaded our early builds than any other Windows release or update in the history of our insider program. And along with our OEM ecosystem, we are excited to bring Windows 11 to new PCs, beginning this holiday. And with Windows 365, we are creating a new category, the Cloud PC. Just like applications move to the cloud with SaaS, we are now bringing the operating system to the cloud, enabling organizations to stream the full Windows experience to any employee’s personal or corporate device. Now on to security. With the cybersecurity landscape more complex than ever, it’s never been clearer that every organization will need to deploy and maintain a zero trust security architecture. This is driving accelerated demand for our integrated end-to-end solutions spanning identity, security, compliance and device management across all clouds and all platforms. No other vendor is recognized by analysts as the leader in as many categories. This is reflected in our share gains with nearly 600,000 organizations, including FedEx, Nestlé, NTT and Volkswagen using our security offerings across Azure and Microsoft 365. We saw a 70% increase in the number of small and medium business customers. And it’s reflected in our sales growth, with annual revenue continuing to increase 40% year-over-year. We’re going further to protect organizations and our recent acquisitions of CloudKnox, ReFirm Labs and RiskIQ bolster our security capabilities in key areas, including identity management, IoT and threat intelligence. Now, on to gaming. Gaming is the largest category in the entertainment industry, and we are expanding our opportunity to reach the world’s 3 billion gamers wherever and whenever they play. We are all in on games. At E3 last month, we unveiled our biggest games lineup ever, announcing 27 new titles, which will all be available to Game Pass subscribers. Game Pass is growing rapidly and it’s transforming how people discover, connect and play games. Subscribers play approximately 40% more games and spend 50% more than nonmembers. We continue to lead in the fast-growing cloud gaming market with last month -- just last month, we made Xbox Cloud gaming available on PCs as well as Apple phones and tablets via the browser in 22 countries with more to come. Millions have already streamed games to their desktops, tablets and phones. And the Xbox Series S and X are our fastest-selling consoles ever, with more consoles sold live to date than any previous generation. Finally, we continue to grow our opportunity in the creator economy, adding new ways for players to build and monetize their creations in many of our most popular games, including Flight Simulator and Minecraft. Creators earned more than double what they did a year ago across our titles. In closing, going forward, every person and every organization will require more digital technology to be more resilient and to transform. We are innovating across the entire tech stack to ensure our customers succeed in this new era. With that, I’ll hand it over to Amy.",2195.0,1250.0,46.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,4.0,8.0,5.0,4.0,0.0368,0.0016,0.0048,0.0,0.0032,0.0352
MSFT,2021-07-27,2021-07-28,,2021-07-27,2021-07-27T17:00:00-04:00,0,2021-07-27,qa,qna_heading,Amy Hood,"Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $46.2 billion, up 21% and 17% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.17, increasing 49% and 42% in constant currency. In our largest quarter of the year, focused execution by our sales and partner teams, along with broad-based strength across geographical markets and customer segments drove another very strong quarter of top and bottom line growth. In our commercial business, healthy demand for our differentiated hybrid and cloud offering as well as increased long-term commitment to our platform drove significant growth in the number of $10 million-plus Azure and Microsoft 365 contracts. Customer reliance on the Microsoft Cloud drove sequential increases in usage across Teams, Power Platform and our Advanced Security and identity offerings, which are empowering organizations to shift to hybrid work and modernize business processes. And in LinkedIn Talent Solutions business, an improving job market drove strength in annual contracts and job postings. In our on-premises business, strong annuity performance across Officer, Server and Windows also benefited from a greater mix of contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition under ASC 606. In our Consumer business, Windows OEM and Surface were impacted by the ongoing constraints in the supply chain. Search and LinkedIn benefited from an improved advertising market. And in gaming, we again saw strong engagement across our platform, while demand for Xbox Series X and S consoles continued to exceed supply. As a reminder, Q4 was the first full quarter impacted by COVID-19 a year ago across revenue and operating expense. This quarter, even with a declining exploration base, commercial bookings grew 30% and 25% in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by strong execution across our core annuity sales motions and an increase in the number of larger long-term Azure contracts. As a result, commercial remaining performance obligation increased 32% and 31% in constant currency to $141 billion. Roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 25% year-over-year. The remaining portion, which will be recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 38% year-over-year, highlighting the growing long-term commitment to our Microsoft Cloud. And our annuity mix increased 1 point year-over-year to 95%. Commercial cloud revenue, also better than expected, was $19.5 billion as growth accelerated to 36% and 31% in constant currency. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage expanded 4 points year-over-year to 70%, with roughly 1 point from the change in accounting estimate for the useful life of server and network equipment assets. Excluding this impact, commercial cloud gross margin percentage increased despite revenue mix shift to Azure, driven by improvement across all our cloud services on a prior year comparable impacted by strategic investments we made to support significant customer engagement and usage in remote work scenarios, including free trials, flexible financing options and capacity for cloud infrastructure usage. With the weaker U.S. dollar, FX increased growth by approximately 4 points, about 1 point more favorable than anticipated. FX increased COGS growth by approximately 1 point and operating expense growth by approximately 2 points, both in line with expectations. Gross margin dollars increased 25% and 20% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage was 70%, up 2 points year-over-year, with roughly 1 point of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate. Excluding this impact, Company gross margin percentage increased despite sales mix shift to the cloud, driven by commercial cloud gross margin percentage improvement noted earlier. Operating expense grew 6% and 4% in constant currency, in line with expectations on a prior year comparable that included roughly 4 points of impact from the realignment of our retail storage strategy and 2 points of impact from an increase in bad debt expense. Overall, Company headcount grew again this quarter, up 12% year-over-year as we continue to invest across key areas like cloud engineering, sales and customer deployment. Operating income increased 42% and 35% in constant currency, and operating margins expanded 6 points year-over-year to 41%, including roughly 2 points of impact from the retail stores charge and increase in bad debt expense in the prior year and nearly 1 point of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate. Now, to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $14.7 billion and grew 25% and 21% in constant currency with better-than-expected performance across all businesses. Office Commercial revenue grew 20% and 15% in constant currency. Office 365 Commercial revenue grew 25% and 20% in constant currency, again driven by installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments, as well as higher ARPU. Paid Office 365 Commercial seats increased 17% year-over-year, with continued recovery driving acceleration in our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings. Demand for Microsoft 365, particularly for security, compliance and voice drove strong E5 momentum again this quarter. E5 now accounts for 8% of our Office 365 Commercial installed base. And on a low prior year comparable impacted by a slowdown in transactional purchasing, Office Commercial licensing was ahead of expectations, down 8% and 11% in constant currency, also benefiting from higher in-period revenue recognition noted earlier. In Office Consumer, revenue grew 18% and 15% in constant currency, driven by continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew to 51.9 million, up 22% year-over-year. Dynamics revenue grew 33% and 26% in constant currency, better than expected. Dynamics 365 revenue growth was 49%, and 42% in constant currency, with strong momentum in Power Apps and Power Automate, reflecting growing demand for our modern solutions to build apps and automate workflows. Dynamics 365 now accounts for over 70% of total Dynamics revenue. LinkedIn revenue increased 46% and 42% in constant currency, ahead of expectations against the comparable impacted by the advertising and job markets of a year ago. Segment gross margin dollars increased 33% and 27% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage was up 5 points year-over-year, primarily driven by improvement in our cloud services against a low prior year comparable impacted mostly by increased usage. The change in accounting estimate drove roughly 1 point of favorable impact. Operating expense increased 8% and 6% in constant currency, and operating income increased 62% and 53% in constant currency, including 4 points due to the change in accounting estimate. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $17.4 billion, increasing 30% and 26% in constant currency. We exceeded expectations across our consumption and per-user Azure businesses as well as in our on-premises server products business. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue increased 34% and 29% in constant currency. Azure revenue grew 51% and 45% in constant currency, driven by strong performance across our core and premium consumption-based services. In our per user business, the enterprise mobility and security installed base increased 29% to over 190 million seats. Our on-premise server business increased 16% and 12% in constant currency, driven by strong annuity performance and benefiting roughly 4 points from the higher in-period revenue recognition noted earlier, particularly in some of our largest deals in the quarter. Enterprise Services revenue grew 12% and 9% in constant currency, driven by growth in premier support services and Microsoft consulting services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 32% and 27% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage increased 1 point year-over-year with roughly 1 point of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate. Operating expense increased 14% and 12% in constant currency, and operating income grew 46% and 39% in constant currency, including 3 points due to the change in accounting estimate. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $14.1 billion, increasing 9% and 6% in constant currency, with better-than-expected performance in Windows Commercial, gaming and search offsetting OEM and Surface weakness from supply chain constraints. OEM revenue declined 3% and Surface declined 20% and 23% in constant currency as both were impacted by the significant supply chain constraints noted earlier in a good demand environment. Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 20% and 14% in constant currency, driven by demand for Microsoft 365, with some benefit from the higher in-period revenue recognition, noted earlier. Search revenue ex TAC increased 53% and 49% in constant currency, benefiting from the improved advertising market. And in gaming, revenue increased 11% and 7% in constant currency. Xbox hardware revenue grew 172% and 163% in constant currency, driven by demand for our new consoles. Xbox content and services revenue declined 4% and 7% in constant currency against a high prior year comparable. Segment gross margin dollars increased 8% and 4% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage decreased roughly 1 point year-over-year, driven by sales mix shift to gaming hardware. Operating expense decreased 6% and 7% in constant currency, including approximately 13 points of impact from the retail stores charge in the prior year. And operating income grew 19% and 13% in constant currency. Now, back to our total Company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $7.3 billion, in line with expectations, driven by ongoing investment to support growing global demand and usage of our cloud services. Cash paid for PP&E was $6.5 billion. Cash flow from operations was $22.7 billion, increasing 22% year-over-year, driven by strong cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $16.3 billion, up 17%, reflecting higher capital expenditures in support of our growing cloud business. For FY21, we generated over $76 billion in operating cash flow, up 26% year-over-year, and over $56 billion in free cash flow, up 24% year-over-year. This quarter, other income and expense was $310 million, higher than anticipated, primarily driven by net gains on investments. As a reminder, we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio. Our effective tax rate was approximately 15%. And finally, we returned $10.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, bringing our total cash returned to shareholders to over $39 billion for the full fiscal year. Now, before we turn to our outlook, I’d like to provide a few reminders for next fiscal year. Revenue growth rates across all segments will reflect the impact from COVID-19 a year ago, though the impacts do shift as we move through the year. Also, our FY21 operating income and margin benefited from two factors that will be headwinds in FY22: first, the change in accounting estimate for the useful life of server and network equipment resulted in $2.7 billion of depreciation expense, shifting from FY21 to future periods; and second, we saved nearly $1.2 billion in operating expense from COVID-19-related restrictions, which will also moderate in FY22 as geographies reopen globally. With those reminders in place, let’s move to our next quarter outlook. Accelerating digital transformation and consistent strong execution should drive another quarter of growing commitment to our Microsoft Cloud. In commercial bookings, our core annuity sales motions should drive healthy growth on a growing expiry base even against a strong prior year comparable. As always, quarterly volatility in bookings can be driven by an increasing mix of larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage should decrease roughly 1 point year-over-year, with roughly 4 points of negative impact from the change in accounting estimate previously discussed. Excluding the accounting change, Q1 gross margin percentage will increase despite revenue mix shift to Azure, driven by continued improvement across our cloud services on a prior year comparable impacted by the strategic investments we mentioned earlier. Longer term, which excludes the impact of the accounting change, commercial cloud gross margin percentage will continue to be impacted by the same three things we often discuss, revenue mix shift to Azure, increased usage of our cloud services and ongoing strategic investments to support our customers’ success. In capital expenditures, we expect a sequential increase on a dollar basis as we continue to invest to meet global demand for our cloud services. Now to FX. Based on current rates, we expect FX to increase revenue growth of the total Company and all individual segment levels by approximately 2 points and total operating expense and COGS growth by approximately 1 point. Now to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $14.5 billion and $14.75 billion. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with healthy seat growth across segments and continued momentum in E5. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline approximately 20%, consistent with the ongoing customer shift to the cloud. In Office Consumer, against a strong prior year comparable, we expect high-single-digit revenue growth with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 Consumer subscriptions. For LinkedIn, continued strong engagement on the platform and improvements in the advertising and job markets should drive revenue growth in the high 30% range. And in Dynamics, we expect continued strength in Dynamics 365, which includes our significant momentum in Power Apps to drive revenue growth in the high-20s. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $16.4 billion and $16.65 billion. In Azure, revenue will be driven by continued strong growth in our consumption-based business. And our per user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect some moderation in growth rate, given the size of the installed base. Therefore, in constant currency, Azure revenue growth should remain relatively stable on a sequential basis. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue growth in the high single digits, driven by continued demand for our hybrid and premium annuity offerings against a low prior year comparable. And in Enterprise Services, we expect revenue to be in the high single digits. In More Personal Computing, we have estimated the Q1 impact of the required Windows 11 revenue deferral that will shift to Q2 to be approximately $300 million. Therefore, our segment revenue outlook is $12.4 billion to $12.8 billion. Given the 10-point estimated negative impact from the deferral, OEM revenue should decline mid to high single digits in Q1. In Surface, on a strong prior year comparable, we expect revenue to decline in the low teens as we continue to work through the supply chain challenges. In Windows Commercial, products and cloud services, continued demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive healthy double-digit growth. In search ex TAC, we expect revenue growth in the high-30s, driven by improvements in the advertising market. In gaming, we expect revenue growth in the low double-digits. Console growth will again be constrained by supply. And on a strong prior year comparable, Xbox content and services revenue should grow low single digits. Now back to Company guidance. We expect COGS of $13.55 billion to $13.75 billion and operating expense of $11.6 billion to $11.7 billion. In other income and expense, interest income and expense should offset each other. And finally, we expect our Q1 tax rate to be approximately 16%, lower than our expected full year rate, given the volume of equity vest in our first quarter. In closing, we remain focused on driving revenue growth as we invest boldly against the strategic high-growth opportunities ahead that will deliver significant value to our customers worldwide. Our outlook for FY22 reflects this with healthy double-digit revenue and operating income growth. Together that results in expanded operating margins in FY22 after excluding the headwinds from the useful life change noted earlier. Together with our customers and partners, we look forward to FY22.

And congratulations on a great FY21 and a great end to the fiscal year. Satya, last year at this time, you made a comment that I think really defined the conversation in software over the past year. When you’re talking about an acceleration in digital transformation you saw coming out of COVID, and I think that’s evident in the results that we see here with 25% growth in your commercial bookings growth. What I want to ask you is the durability of that growth on a going-forward basis. Was that acceleration a pull forward of demand and at some point we’re going to have that hard comp, or do you see durability in this acceleration on a go-forward basis? Is there a lot more to come? And then, Amy, to you, a similar kind of question but more on sort of the margin side of the equation. I think your entire tenure at Morgan -- at Microsoft has really been defined by good operational controls and ability to grow gross profit dollars well ahead of OpEx. Is that durable longer term? Is there still enough sort of efficiency gains at Microsoft to be able to keep that up over the medium term, if you will?",215.0,97.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.041237113402061855,0.020618556701030927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.020618556701030927

I mean, the way we see the results today reflect that, but more importantly, on a secular basis, as I think about -- I always go back to that number, which is 5% of the world GDP is tech spend, it’s projected to double. I think that doubling will happen in a more accelerated pace. And we feel well-positioned because of the innovation across the stack. Because if you think about it, what’s going to happen is every business, whether you’re a retailer or a manufacturer, in the service sector, public sector or private sector, digital adoption is the way you’re going to be both, resilient as well as transform the core business processes. And the strength we have is that entirety of the Microsoft Cloud stack, right? So, it’s not just about infrastructure or any application, it’s the entirety of what we do. And so, I think it is durable. Quarter-to-quarter, depending on what happened during the pandemic, depending on the segments that were impacted, for example, the consumer segments that were impacted are coming back and then they’ll normalize. Whereas in our case, we do, in fact, one of the things I love about sort of our exposure is both, it’s a worldwide exposure and it has got the right balance between the consumer segments and the enterprise business-to-business segment. So, it’s a very durable long-term growth prospect that we have tough competition, we need to keep innovating, which is what we’ll stay focused on.",268.0,116.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,0.02586206896551724,0.008620689655172414,0.034482758620689655,0.008620689655172414,0.017241379310344827,0.017241379310344827

When you do that in expansive total addressable markets in the way that I believe we’re focused on as an organization, you do see the type of operating leverage that you’re referring to in margins. And that along, as you see sort of mathematically with a shift in our revenue to higher overall gross margin segments, you do get the results we’ve seen. So, I feel very good about the work we’ve done.

And again, also, congrats on the quarter, and Amy, thanks for the details and color, especially in the guidance. So, I want to ask about seasonality in Azure. Traditionally, we’ve seen seasonality in the Azure numbers in Q4. And obviously, last year, we didn’t see it because of COVID, but we also didn’t see it this year. Has something changed that has changed the seasonality of the business? And does that continue going forward? And then, as a follow-up question, Keith asked about OpEx efficiency overall, but I’d like to ask specifically on the cloud. Is there any reason that cloud OpEx shouldn’t continue to grow slower than revenue, obviously, on an annual basis, not a quarterly basis?

Let me cover your first one, which is the seasonality in the Azure business. In some ways, Mark, some of that seasonality frankly was because Azure has two fundamental components. It’s got a consumption model as well as a per-user model. The per-user model, which as you well know is far more aligned to our end-of-year and can be more aligned to our end-of-year rhythms. It also can have more quarterly volatility in terms of accounting, in terms of revenue recognition, the same topic we often talk about when it comes to Microsoft 365 in terms of more in-quarter recognition. What you’ve seen is that did historically represent a larger component of Azure, so added volatility to Q4. As we’ve seen our consumption businesses grow and grow consistently, thus far becoming a larger percentage of Azure, you do have more stability, Mark. And so, you start seeing less of that volatility that we’ve historically seen from Q3 to Q4. We still have some of it, as we talked about, but I think it’s an interesting observation and it’s a very good question. In terms of your comment on cloud revenue and OpEx, yes, I do believe that’s durable. We get a lot of focus. We’ll continue to invest. There’s lots of opportunity there, but the market certainly warrants it.",239.0,105.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02857142857142857,0.047619047619047616,0.0380952380952381,0.0,0.0,-0.01904761904761905

But, what sits behind that, Keith is -- I mean, sorry, Brent, is this focus on the first thing I said, which is with every operating expense dollar we invest, are we continuing to invest in the highest growth places? If you continue to invest in high-growth places with differentiation that customers care about and you add value, you continue to see improvements in this area. From time to time, I’m sure there’ll be quarters where that isn’t the case, if we have some mix shift in hardware, et cetera. But in general, over a longer period of time, you’ve seen us focus on this.

One is that all up, even what we consider the cloud infrastructure is getting increasingly distributed. If you think about the approach we took to our data center architecture, the fact that we have more regions, is to meet, I would say, both the real-world needs for the computing architecture side but also the regulatory and data residency requirements. So, we feel we picked the right approach. And that’s paying dividends today just even in terms of our geographic coverage, our coverage of all of the regulatory requirements. Then, the second piece, of course, is distributed computing will remain distributed. And what we are seeing with edge is going to be the case where we will see more of both the old workloads with hybrid benefits and hybrid deployments as well as new workloads, right? So, if you take the AB InBev Digital Twin meets IoT type of scenario, that’s going to require a lot more compute close to their factories. And so, to me, those new scenarios -- or 5G, I mean, think about what AT&T is planning to do, which is a hybrid deployment in a completely new space where there is going to be compute that’s located to be able to take core network traffic and use cloud economics. So, that’s what we think of going forward, which is really compute will remain distributed, both because of their needs across geographies, regulation and the very nature of compute architecture.",260.0,122.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.00819672131147541,0.00819672131147541,0.0,0.02459016393442623,0.02459016393442623,0.0

Brent, unfortunately, I’m going to answer it’s everything, and let me talk about why I say that. When you see the size of the contracts increase, it’s about the entire scope of what’s offered under the Microsoft Cloud. We’re seeing both really strong renewals of our core contracts, really strong additions across Dynamics, Power Apps, Power Automate, M365, premium SKUs, security, compliance, voice, which, of course, increases those commitment sizes. And you’re seeing the addition of Azure commitments, which we often talk about as these multiyear longer-term contracts. And so, then you do, of course, see them just have longer duration on -- especially in the case of Azure. So, in many ways, what we focus on are the components that make up the larger contracts is each component being additive to selling the value that’s present across all of our pieces of the Microsoft Cloud. And this was a good execution quarter for us. You see it in the bookings number even more. When you have a declining expiry base and then bookings growth that’s that high you have to do all those things well.

Multiple things happening and both -- some of them are independent secular growth trends and they do reinforce each other. Let’s just take Dynamics. It’s probably one of the most exciting things we are seeing is that coming out of this pandemic, there is an absolute new chapter for a complete new suite all the way from whether it’s sales, to customer service, to marketing, to supply chain, or digital manufacturing, that’s all going to be re-implemented. So, there’s going to be a complete new cycle of business process automation that is going to be AI-first and collaboration-first. And that second part is where that intersection between Teams and Business Process or Dynamics comes through, because you do not want to have a system of record for anything, whether it is a customer or a part or a forecast that you don’t want to collaborate on, that you don’t want to communicate on. And by the way, the communications and the collaboration artifacts are part of the record. And that’s what I think that this new generation of software will enable. And so, you see it in two fronts. One is, Teams has become a platform, not just for Dynamics, even for Salesforce, for SAP, for Adobe, for ServiceNow. They’re all building great integrations into Teams and we’ll foster that. And Dynamics itself of course will integrate deeply with Teams and embed Teams or Azure Communication Services. So, when you think about our omnichannel customer service module, it doesn’t look like anything that -- from two years ago. It’s a completely rebuilt omnichannel customer service system, which has all the communication functionality built in. So, it’s a pretty exciting space. And it also speaks to a lot of the questions around where is the margin, how is it going to sort of evolve? I think tracking what’s happening with Power Platform, Dynamics and Teams, I think probably and its intersection to even some of our data layers in Azure is perhaps the best indication of some of our competitive differentiation at scale already.",367.0,168.0,7.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.011904761904761904,0.017857142857142856,0.0,0.0,0.02976190476190476

We're off to a fast start in fiscal 2022, with Microsoft Cloud quarterly revenue surpassing $20 billion for the first time, up 36% year-over-year. The case for digital transformation has never been more urgent or more clear. Digital technology is a deflationary force in an inflationary economy. Businesses small and large can improve productivity and the affordability of their products and services by building tech in density. The Microsoft Cloud delivers the end-to-end platforms and tools organizations need to navigate this time of transition and change.  Now, I'll highlight examples of our innovation and momentum, starting with Azure. Every organization will need a distributed computing fabric across the cloud and the edge to rapidly build, manage, and deploy applications anywhere. We are building Azure as the world's computer, with more datacenter regions than any other provider delivering fast access to cloud services while addressing critical data residency requirements.  And we're partnering with mobile operators from AT&T and Verizon in the U.S., to Telefonica and BG in Europe, Telstra and SingTel in Asia Pacific, as they embrace new business models and bring ultra-low latency compute power and storage to the network and the enterprise edge. 78% of the Fortune 500 use our hybrid offerings. And with Azure ANC, customers like Nokia, Royal Bank of Canada and SKF can deploy and run applications at the edge or in multi-cloud environments.  Organizations also prefer our Cloud to power the mission-critical apps they rely on every day. G Healthcare and Procter & Gamble migrated critical workloads to Azure this quarter. And leading companies -- our companies in every industry including Bertelsmann, Kimberly-Clark, the NBA Softbank, Decent Crop, all chose Azure for their SAP workloads. Now onto data, the leading indicator of digital transformation success in an organizations, is organizations that ability to turn data into analytical and predictive bar.  Azure Synapse brings together data integration, enterprise data warehousing, and big data analytics into a comprehensive solution. With Synpase Link for Dataverse, organizations can analyze data from business applications like Power Platform, and Dynamics 365 with just a few clicks. With Synpase Link for Cosmos DB, they can run real-time, no ETL analytics over their operational data. And with Power BI, anyone in the organization can access these insights. Thousands of active Power BI customers are using Synapse today. More than ever, every business needs a holistic understanding of its data estate. And Azure purview, now generally available is helping organizations such as FedEx, manage and govern on-premise, multi-cloud, and SaaS data. Now onto developers, as every Company becomes a digital Company, they will need standardized tools to modernize existing apps and build new ones. From GitHub to Visual Studio, we have the most used and loved developer tools to build any app on any platform. GitHub, is now home to 73 million developers up 2x since our acquisition three years ago.  More and more businesses are choosing GitHub enterprise to provide their developer teams the most advanced platform to build, ship and maintain software. This quarter alone, we introduced more than 70 enterprise features, 84% of the Fortune 100 use GitHub, and we're seeing growing usage from digital native Companies and the world's most established firms. From Pinterest to Procter & Gamble, from Stripe to Society Generale, we're rapidly innovating in AI and our large-scale models are powering everything, from meeting recaps and Teams, to helping developers code in GitHub, to the next best action in Dynamics 365.  And as machine learning continues to mature, managing the life cycle of models or ML ops has become more prevalent and Azure ML is now the go-to tool for data science teams. And large organizations from Ecolab to Providence Healthcare are relying on Azure AI to better meet customer needs. Now, to Power Platform. With Power Platform, we're helping domain experts drive productivity gains with low-code, no-code tools, robotic process automation, virtual agents, and business intelligence. All up, Power Platform now has nearly 20 million monthly active users, up 76% year-over-year.  Power Apps is the undisputed market leader in low-code no-code tools, now with 10 million monthly active users. 91% of the Fortune 500 use the service to build applications, and a 129 organizations have more than 10,000 users, including 3M, EY, GSK, Marks and Spencer, Sony, and ZF Group. Now on to Dynamics 365, going forward, every business process will be collaborative, powered by data and AI, and will bridge the digital and physical world. Dynamics 365 ushers in this hyper-connected business process era.  We continue to gain share with Dynamics 365 and teams we are creating a complete, new category of collaborative applications that help businesses like Rockwell Automation, Willis Towers Watson, surface data and insights across the entire organization. Dynamics 365 Customer Insights leads this category. Customers like, Meyer are using it to create 360 degree view of customers in order to deliver more personalized experiences. All up the number of customer profiles increased a 174% year-over-year. Now on to industry.  Our industry clouds, bringing together capabilities across the entire Microsoft Cloud along with industry-specific customizations to improve time-to-value, increase agility, and lower costs. We're seeing strong customer adoption of our new Industry Cloud for healthcare, and our clients for financial services and manufacturing will become more broadly available next week. Sustainability is an existential priority for our society and for every business today. And when we think about our approach to sustainability, it's more than just the carbon footprint of our own datacenters.  With our Microsoft Cloud for sustainability, we're creating an entirely new business process category to help organizations monitor the carbon footprint across their operations. The world's largest baking Company, Grupo Bimbo, for example, is using our tools to report, record, and reduce its emissions in every country where it operates. Now onto LinkedIn, we're experiencing a great reshuffle across the global labor market, as people are rethinking not only where and how they work, but why.  And as more people change jobs than ever before, we saw record engagement as they increasingly turn to LinkedIn to connect, learn, grow, and get hired. LinkedIn now has nearly 800 million members. Confirmed hires on the platform increased more than a 160% year-over-year. And this quarter, we launched new ways to help job-seekers discover roles that align with how they want to work. In a rapidly-evolving labor market, companies are increasingly turning to LinkedIn Learning to up-skill and re-skill their employees.  We now have over 15,000 enterprise customers of LinkedIn Learning, and we are expanding our opportunity in the creator economy, including offering new ways for LinkedIn Learning instructors to build their audiences and connect with learners live. Businesses continue to choose LinkedIn as the trusted way to reach professionals. LinkedIn advertising revenue was up 61% year-over-year. Now onto Microsoft 365 and teams. Flexibility and productivity are not mutually exclusive.  We are innovating to empower people to have impact from home, in the office, and anywhere in between. Microsoft Teams is the only solution that supports all the ways people work. Usage has never been higher. A 138 organizations now have more than a 100,000 users of Teams, and more than 3,000, and have more than 10,000 users. Updates to Teams' rooms, including new AI Pod cameras, and spatial audio, ensure every meeting attendee is always a first-class participant. The rise of hybrid work is transforming the enterprise phone market.  And we're taking share across PSTN, and VoIP. Calls originating from Teams chats increased 50% this quarter compared to a year ago. Operator Connect enables organizations to bring their existing service directly into Teams. And leaders in every industry, including Schlumberger, Westpac, ZF Group, REI, and SAP chose Teams  this quarter to meet all their internal and external calling needs. Moving forward, organizations will need a digital fabric that spans organizational boundaries to address key challenges like customer service swarming and supply chain resilience.  With Teams Connect, employees across multiple companies can chat and collaborate as one extended team without switching tenants. In private preview, we're already seeing strong interest in usage from companies like LVMH and WPP. Teams by itself has become a first-class platform for application development. For example, employees at Levi Strauss, an NTT data are using service now, applications right within Teams Drax's critical info within the flow of work.  Organizations are also using Power Platform to build their own rich, collaborative apps within Teams for everything, from curbside pickup to care team coordination. All of the number of organizations with more than 10 thousand users integrating that third-party and line of business applications with teams increased 82% year-over-year. We're creating a complete new category with Microsoft Veeva, which brings together communications, knowledge, learning, resources, and insights.  Our acquisition of Ally.io, a leader in the fast-growing objectives and key results category, adds new tools to help employees drive outcomes, not just output, in hybrid work. , Old Mutual, PayPal, and Toyota North America all chose  to help strengthen connections between employees and their mission between employees and managers and drive individual empowerment. Across Microsoft 365, we're seeing growth in all segments, including triple-digit year-over-year usage, growth of Teams in front-line.  one of Australia's largest retailers chose Teams to bring two-way communications to more than a 120,000 frontline employees.  And Chevron, H&M, Lumen and St. Jude all turn to our premium Microsoft 365 E-5 offerings for advanced security compliance, voice and analytics. Now onto Windows. Earlier this month, we launched Windows 11, the biggest update to our operating system in a decade. When I step back and reflect on the future of how we work, connect, and play, one thing is clear, the PC will be more critical than ever. There has been a structural shift in PC demand emerging from this pandemic, and we delighted with the early response to Windows 11, with every new generation of windows.  We also unlocked the next generation of hardware innovation across our ecosystem. And together with our OEM partners, we are excited to offer the widest choice of Windows 11 devices at every price point in every form factor this holiday. We are providing people and organizations everywhere with the most differentiated devices for productivity, learning, and gaming, and also have massive opportunity to create a new class of applications that take advantage of the edge and AI capabilities in Windows, coupled with cloud.  And Windows 11, is also the most open platform. It's pioneering new store commerce models and policies with both Amazon and Epic Games of bringing their marketplaces to the Microsoft Store. Now on to security. Cyber security is the number one threat facing businesses today. Our goal is to help every organization strengthen its defense through the zero trust architecture built on end-to-end solutions that span all clouds and all platforms. We analyze over 24 trillion signals across email, endpoints, and identities each day and translate this intelligence into innovative features to protect our customers.  We have prevented more than 70 billion attacks over the past year alone. We now have nearly 650,000 customers using our security solutions, up 50% year-over-year. And businesses like  Healthcare and Siemens switched to our security solutions to protect their endpoints. In identity, Azure active directory now has more than 500 million monthly active users, and we have seen usage of third-party apps increase 1.5X year-over-year. And the future of security is password-less.  Nearly 240 million users have adopted password-less login to-date and consumers can now completely remove passwords from their personal Microsoft accounts. And we're not stopping there. Over the next 5 years, we'll invest $20 billion to advance our security solutions and protect customers. Now, on to gaming. We continue to attract new gamers and retain those we have gained over the past year and a half. We saw record first-quarter monetization and engagement.  This holiday season will bring our biggest lineup of content and exclusive games ever, with 3 new AAA titles, including Halo Infinitive available via Game Pass subscription service, which continues to offer the best value in gaming. We're also bringing XCloud gaming to the console for the first time, enabling Xbox users to discover the stream and stream more than a 100 games with just a click. Cloud gaming is now available in 26 countries, including as of this quarter, in Australia, Brazil, Mexico, and Japan.  We are expanding our opportunity with independent creators as well as top studios. Updates to Azure PlayFab make it easier for developers to integrate the creator marketplace in games they built. And leading publishers from Bungie to Craften, are all relying on our cloud to scale and operate their games. In closing, we have the most diversified set of digital businesses, and we are innovating to expand our opportunity across the entire portfolio to help our customers in this new era.  Next week, we'll hold our flagship Ignite Conference where we will share the next chapter of Microsoft Cloud from the  to large-scale AI, from hybrid work to hybrid infrastructure. I couldn't be more optimistic about the opportunities ahead. With that, I'll hand it over to Amy.",2208.0,1221.0,42.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,15.0,4.0,3.0,0.0343980343980344,0.003276003276003276,0.004095004095004095,0.0,0.001638001638001638,0.031122031122031123

Our First-Quarter revenue was $45.3 billion, up 22% and 20% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.27, an d increased 25% and 23% in constant currency when adjusted for a net tax benefit of $3.3 billion related to the transfer of intangible properties this quarter. Our sales teams and partners delivered a strong start to the fiscal year. And our commercial business, customers continue to choose the Microsoft Cloud. We again saw healthy growth in our Azure consumption-based. business, and increased usage across products, such as Teams and Power Platform, and  reflected in the comments.  In our on-premises business, annuity performance in Office to Server benefited from a greater-than-expected mix of contracts, with higher in-period revenue recognition. And in LinkedIn, the talent Solutions business continued to benefit from an improved job market. In our consumer business, Windows OEM performance was better than expected in a growing PC market, despite ongoing supply chain constraints. We also saw positive demand signals for Windows 11 ahead of launch with nearly all devices built this quarter eligible for upgrade. Microsoft 365 subscription growth drove Office consumer results, advertising market growth drove another strong quarter in LinkedIn, as well as searching News advertising.  And in gaming, we were able to ship more Xbox series X and S consoles than expected, even as demand continues to exceed supply. Let's move to our overall results. Against the strong prior-year comparable commercial bookings grew 11% and 14% in constant currency driven by consistent execution across new, add-on, and renewal sales motions. This Quarter, growth was Impacted by fewer large long-term Azure contracts, which are unpredictable in their timing. As a result, commercial remaining performance obligation increased 28% and 29% in constant currency to $137 billion with a roughly equivalent split between revenues that will be recognized within and the portion beyond the next 12 months.  And our annuity mix increased 2 points year-over-year to 95%. Microsoft Cloud revenue grew 36% and 34% in constant currency to $20.7 billion ahead of expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 71%. Excluding the impact from a change in accounting estimate for the useful life of server and network equipment assets. Microsoft Cloud, gross margin percentage increased roughly 4 points, driven by improvement in our Cloud Services, particularly in Azure and Office 365, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure.  With the weaker U.S. dollar FX increased total Company Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud revenue growth by 2 points. In line with expectations. More personal computing revenue growth was increased by 1 point , less favorable than expected. affects increased cost by 1 point, in line with expectations, and had no impact to operating expense, slightly more favorable than expected. Gross margin dollars increased 21%, and 19% constant currency.  Gross margin percentage was 70%, down slightly year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate discussed earlier, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point, driven by improvements in Cloud Services noted earlier, partially offset by sales mix shift to Cloud. Operating expense increased 11%, lower than expected, primarily driven by investments that shifted to future quarters. At a total Company level, headcount grew 14% year-over-year, as we continue to invest in key areas, such as Cloud engineering, sales, customer deployment, and gaming.  Operating income increased 27% and 24% in constant currency, and operating margins expanded two points year-over-year to 45%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins expanded roughly four points year-over-year. Now, to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $15 billion and grew 22% and 20% in constant currency, with better -than-expected performance in Office, commercial, and LinkedIn . Office commercial revenue grew 18% and 16% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue grew 23% and 21% in constant currency driven by installed base expansion across all workloads and all customer segments, as well as higher ARPU.  Demand for our advanced security, compliance, and voice offerings growth continued momentum in E5 revenue this quarter. Paid office 365 commercial seats increased 17% year-over-year, driven by another strong quarter of growth in our small and medium business and front-line worker offerings. Office commercial licensing decreased 13% and 14% in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations, benefiting from the higher end period revenue recognition noted earlier. Office Consumer revenue grew 10% and 8% in constant currency on a strong prior-year comparable, with better-than-expected growth in Microsoft 365 subscriptions.  Over the past 2 years, our Microsoft 365 subscriber base has grown over 50%, reaching 54.1 million this quarter. Dynamics revenue grew 31% and 29% in constant currency. Dynamic 365 revenue growth was 48% and 45% in constant currency with continued strong demand for Power Apps, which grew 202% and 197% in constant currency. And in LinkedIn, revenue increased 42% and 39% at constant currency, with continued strength in marketing solutions and better-than-expected performance in talent solutions from the improved job market  earlier.  Segment gross margin dollars increased 22% at 20% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased slightly. Excluding the impact of the Teams accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly two points, driven by improvement across all Cloud services. Operating expense, increased 7% and operating income, increased 33% and 29% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $17 billion, increasing 31% and 29% in constant currency ahead of expectations, driven by continued customer demand for our differentiated, hybrid and Cloud offerings.  Overall several products and cloud services revenue increased 35% and 33% in constant currency. Azure and other Cloud Services grew 50% and 48% in constant-currency ahead of expectations, driven by our consumption based services. The ARPU user business, the enterprise mobility and security installed base grew 30% to over 196 billion seats. In our on-premises business on a low prior-year comparable revenue increased 14% and 13% in constant currency ahead of expectations.  Strengthen, our annuity business, was driven by healthy demand for our hybrid offerings that include Windows Server and SQL Server running in multi-cloud environments and higher in-period revenue recognition, including benefit from annuity purchasing ahead of the Windows Server 2022 launch. Enterprise Services revenue grew 9% and 8% in constant currency driven by growth in Microsoft consulting services and Enterprise Support Services. Technical gross margin dollars increased 28% to 26% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 1 point, year-over-year.  Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points, driven by improvements in Azure, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure. Operating expense, increased 13% and 12% in constant currency and operating income grew 39% and 37% in constant currency. Now, to more personal computing, revenue was $13.3 billion increasing 12% and 11% in constant currency with better-than-expected performance and Windows OEM and gaming.  Windows OEM revenue increased 10% driven by a stronger-than-expected PC market, particularly in the commercial segment, which has higher revenue per license. These results include roughly seven points of impact from the $210 million revenue deferral related to Windows 11 licenses sold to OEMs prior to general availability. The deferral was lower-than-expected OEMs prioritized upgraded eligible device bills early in the quarter. Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 12% and 10% in constant currency driven by demand for Microsoft 365.  Surface revenue declined 17% and 19% in constant currency on a strong prior-year comparable. Surge and news advertising revenue, XTech, increased 40% and 39% in constant currency in line with expectations benefiting from the advertising market noted earlier. And in gaming, revenue increased 16% at 14% in constant-currency ahead of expectations, better than expected console supply and continued strong demand. Resulted in Xbox hardware revenue growth of a 166% and 162% in constant currency. Xbox content services revenue increased 2%, and was relatively unchanged in constant currency against a strong prior-year comparable.  Segment gross margin dollars increased 10% and 8% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage decreased roughly 1 point year-over-year, driven by sales mix shift to gaming hardware. Operating expenses increased 15% driven by the ZeniMax acquisition, as well as Windows 11 marketing. Operating income grew 7% and 5% in constant currency. Now, back to total Company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $7.4 billion in line with expectations. and cash paid for PP&E was $5.8 billion.  Our capital investments, including both new datacenter regions and expansion in existing regions, continued to be based on significant customer demand and usage signals. Cash flow from operations was $24.5 billion, increasing 27% year-over-year, driven by strong Cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $18.7 billion up 30% year-over-year. This quarter, other income and expense was $286 million higher than anticipated, primarily driven by net gains on investments. As a reminder, we are required to recognize market-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio.  Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was approximately 16%. And finally we've returned $10.9 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Now, before we turn to our outlook, I'd like to provide a couple of reminders. First, the outlook we give, unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S. dollar basis. Second, my remarks for the next quarter do not include the impact from the Nuance acquisition, which we now expect to close by the end of Q2 or early Q3.  With that, let's move to our second quarter outlook. In our commercial business, our differentiated market position, compelling solution portfolio, and consistent execution should drive another strong quarter. Commercial bookings growth should again be healthy but impacted by modest growth in the Q2 XFree base and the normal quarterly volatility from large long-term Azure contracts previously discussed. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased roughly two points year-over-year, excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate previously discussed.  Hugh gross margin percentage will increase roughly two points driven by continued improvement across our services despite revenue mix shift to Azure. Longer-term, we expect the Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage to be impacted by revenue mix shift to Azure, increased usage of our Microsoft Cloud services, And ongoing strategic investments to support our customers success. And on a dollar basis, we expect capital expenditures to be roughly in line with the last quarter, as we continue to invest to support growing demand.  Now to FX, based on current rates, we expect FX to increase revenue at the total Company and all individual segment levels by approximately one point and have no impact on total COGS or operating expense growth. Next, to segment guidance, in Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $15.7 and $15.95 billion. In office commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with healthy growth across customer segments and continued momentum in E5.  In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the high teens consistent with the ongoing customer shift to the Cloud. In Office Consumer, we expect revenue to grow in the mid-teens with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 Consumer subscriptions. For LinkedIn, a strong job market and continued engagement on the platform should drive revenue growth in the mid 30% range and in dynamics we expect revenue growth similar to Q1. Driven by Strength and Dynamic 365 including continued momentum in Powerhouse For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $18.1 billion and $18.35 billion.  Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability, primarily from our per-user business and from  revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Q2 we expect healthy drive based growth in our Azure consumption business consistent with recent trends. And per user business, while continuing to benefit from Microsoft 365 sweet momentum should see a moderation in growth rates given the size of we expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits driven by continued demand for hybrid solutions.  In enterprise services, we expect revenue growth to be in the high single digits, In more personal computing, we expect revenue between $16.35 and $16.75 billion. Despite ongoing supply chain constraints, OEM revenue should grow low to mid-teens including 6 points of impact $10 million dollar Window 11referal that shifted revenue from Q1 to Q2. In Windows commercial products cloud services customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive low double digit growth.  In Surface, we expect revenue to decline in single digits as we continue to work through supply chain uncertainty, particularly in our premium devices. In Search and News Advertising X Tech, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid 20s. If supply chain uncertainty reduces advertising budgets our results would be negatively impacted. And in gaming, on a high prior-year comparable, that included the launch of our new consoles and strength across Xbox content services, we expect revenue growth in a high single digits.  Console sales will continue to be strong engagement on the Xbox platform in a holiday quarter that will include several AAA title. Now back to Company guidance.  $17 to $17.2 billion and operating expense of $12.7 to $12.8 billion. In other income and expense, interest income and expense should offset each other. And finally, we expect our Q2 effective tax rate to be approximately 17%. In closing, we are off to a strong start in FY '22 with tremendous opportunity to drive sustained, long-term revenue growth.  We remain focused on growing high value usage across our differentiated Microsoft Cloud offerings, and delivering exciting new consumer experiences with Windows 11, Surface and our Xbox gaming platform as we enter the holiday season. Our consistent approach to investing for these and other future opportunities, while continuing to deliver solid operating performance, will drive strong results throughout FY 22 and beyond.

Can you talk to us about how you think about sizing that opportunity in terms of the programmable edge, and maybe help us understand the Microsoft architectural approach versus perhaps some of the competitors coming into the marketplace from the CDN perspective, who are talking about the competitive differentiation by having a more of them last mile solution.

Because we will always, as you know Keith, architected Azure for the distributed computing fabric to remain distributed. In other words, when we talked about hybrid computing even five years ago, the idea was always that, we will always have a Cloud and then we will have a distributed Cloud infrastructure for application deployment. So when we think about Cloud Plus Edge, we even put even the multi-cloud control playing in there, right?  So whether it is, what's happening with the 5G and how naturally compute will go to where data is getting generated with low latency access to a factory floor, to a hospital, to cities where you want to play XCloud gaming, that's one phenomena. The other is just literally treating every Cloud, whether it's the on-premise data center. It's the other public cloud, and our public cloud, and being able to use Azure Arc in its control plane to ease the deployment across all clouds.  That's another thing that we're seeing. So when I think about what is going to be key in such a distributed world is having that full suite of applications infrastructure, right? All the way from the management and security control plane, something like Azure Active Directory managing the security principles and Identities or and to the management control planes like Azure Arc and so we feel well-positioned for it. And I think that the multi-cloud, multi-edge world is really how we build Azure in the first place. And I think we're still very early in all of that playing out, but we feel well-positioned.",279.0,142.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.007042253521126761,0.007042253521126761,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Yeah I think the important thing when you think about bookings performance is to talk about what happened before you got to those volatile, the large Azure commitments that create some of that top comparables that we're talking about. And that's really the opportunity to execute against selling the Microsoft  day to day, which is Dynamics, Microsoft Cloud, GitHub in the broader universe. Our execution on that was actually quite good. Very good renewals, very good recapture rates, very good add - ons, meaning you sell outside of the normal pattern, and so I feel very good.  It's very consistent execution to your point, Brent, this quarter versus others on that front. And then to your point, it's important not to time some of these larger long-dated Azure contracts. That's where the volatility is, the day-to-day execution of Azure commitments, actually was very consistent. The volatility comes with some of the bigger things and with a lot of them in Q4, last on a comparable basis in Q1 and that happens from time-to-time.",184.0,83.0,6.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07228915662650602,0.04819277108433735,0.03614457831325301,0.012048192771084338,0.024096385542168676,0.024096385542168676

So I guess in essence, how did you dodge that bullet, Amy, maybe you could unpack that OEM performance for us. And your view into the second half of the fiscal year.

I want to start by saying and repeating something that Tatia, I think was careful to include in his remarks. And it is the central nature of the PC to relay the nature of both hybrid work and fundamentally about getting jobs done. And I think the central role it's played we've talked about, I think, now for a number of quarters, and I think the reality of that continues to exist. I think the come more real for people as we talk about what hybrid is going to look like and continue to learn what hybrid is going to look like.  And to that end your PCs, the market grew this quarter, and it was constrained by supply. I believe Q2 will also be a strong demand quarter that is constrained by supply. But even with that, we see a growing market. And in particularly, in both Q1 and Q2, we see a strong demand in the commercial segment. I think that ties directly back to some of Satya 's comments about the central nature of the device. Then of course, we do get some benefit, Karl, because revenue per license is higher in commercial than it is in the broad market.  Those things together, which is a growing market, strong Windows performance within that market, in commercial in particular, And then, the resulting higher revenue per license results, and I think a very strong position in Q1 and Q2.",245.0,109.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.03669724770642202,0.0,0.009174311926605505,0.0,0.01834862385321101,0.03669724770642202

In an inflationary environment, the first place any business should go to is how to really ensure that they're able to get productivity gains. And even dealing with constraints, for example, if You have supply chain constraints, one of the things you want to do is run your factories at the efficient frontier, that means things like digital twins, simulation, are the ones where you are going to make sure that every production run has the least amount of wastage.  I think any which way you look, whether it's in the knowledge work, first-line work, whether it's actually digital twins and simulation, All of those things are going to be the best way for any Company to deal with inflationary pressures, so that they can, in fact, have the best productivity and that -- thereby the best ability to be able to meet aggregate demand out there.  That's why we're very, very excited about making sure our software products are available to our business customers all around to be able to manage through this inflationary environment and I'll let Amy add to that.",202.0,94.0,9.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.09574468085106383,0.0,0.010638297872340425,0.0,0.02127659574468085,0.09574468085106383

And there's numerous scenarios across, I think, most industries. That acceleration, of course, regardless, frankly, of the overall environment is a place where we feel like we offer the best portfolio at the Microsoft Cloud and with our Industry Clouds to make that doable with a very fast time to value.  And so our ability to execute against that regardless to the spend environment, means we've got the right portfolio and a high value to customers as deployable quickly that can get them results when they need that. And I think that's reflected in most of the surveys that really point to preference for  to help customers do that.

The first place where we're very, very focused on is to making sure that, with LinkedIn, we're doing everything to help everyone find their best economic opportunity and when Ryan Roslansky was the CEO of LinkedIn, talks about the great reshuffle. I think along with the hybrid work change, there is a real question everybody is asking. Not only where and how they work, but why they work.  And so to be able to make sure that we can help them find the opportunity that they are looking for is, I think, the most critical work that we can be doing. The second side to this, though, is also to per take the productivity of the people, whether they are on the front lines, and the first-line workers, or the knowledge workers, or even software developers, and making sure that they have the best tools, whether it's the GitHub harness and Visual Studio code for people who are developers or whether it is Power Apps or whether it is the Office 365, and then Microsoft 365 tooling to help them be most productive.  That's I think the thing that we're very, very focused on because key to dealing with labor shortages is productivity gains. And that Plus the work we're doing in LinkedIn is where we're focused on.

And Kash, as you probably noted I did talk about -- in this quarter, we did add, year-over-year, 14% headcount growth. And I think that's important, because when you talk about how, what, and why, we do remain focused on being a great employer, to have people achieve those goals and be able to achieve them here. Secondly, you asked some good questions about the supply chain impact, and specifically around data center, given our spend to this quarter, and my guidance is it should be similar next.  A lot of that cash is long lead time. So we have good understanding of lead times required to meet the capacity signals that we're seeing. I think we are doing good job managing that, it's not to say we're not impacted. Multiple suppliers are important to be able to manage through that, and I feel the team has done a very good job. In terms of specific impacts, I noted it, and some remarks, I do think demand will exceed supply in PCs and Surface for us.  This quarter, particularly in premium devices, in consoles for Xbox and another bit of -- another challenge I noted will just be -- we'll just need to watch the advertising market through the quarter, because obviously their willingness to spend is entirely connected to their supply as well.",229.0,106.0,8.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.07547169811320754,0.018867924528301886,0.009433962264150943,0.0,0.009433962264150943,0.05660377358490566

Every day I wake up to talk to customers who are planning out that motion and making sure that that able to modernize their entire application portfolio in various ways. So that's obviously still very, very strong. The interesting thing for us, even in that context, is even in the height of our success in declined server era, we really would never a Tier-1 Company that is not who we are.  In the sense that you take all the SAP workloads that are running on Azure, which I talked about, or other Tier-1 workloads that are migrating, whether it's HPC or transactional database workloads. So that's the other thing which is happening is real production workloads moving over. And then on the data estate, that's the place where perhaps we're seeing significant traction, and I referenced that in some of my remarks all the way from what's happening with, say, operational data stores like Cosmos DB, with Synapse linked to Synapse or Power BI to Synapse or in fact, Dynamics 365 data wars to Synapse.  There's tons and tons of coming together of the data estate, with for example, regulatory requirements now that you need to have real governance on data. That's where Azure Purview becomes, again, a pretty big driver of that data gravity to the Cloud from a governance perspective. The other side of this is what's happening with Dev Tools. When you start having your CI/CD to your Cloud, then modern new applications and the agility with which you bill. So with GitHub, VS code becoming essentially default for any modern dev shop in the enterprise or otherwise, that’s he other thing that we see.  But perhaps more than anything else, the interesting circuit for us is what happens with Teams. With Teams, you suddenly now have a new platform in which applications get hosted, whether it's developed by the enterprise or by third-party. And I referenced that in my remarks, and those applications in many cases get built on our Cloud, use things like Azure DB, use things like Power Platform. and so the reinforcing and compounding side of Teams to Power Apps to Dynamics to Azure is probably one of the most unique things we're seeing in terms of new applications getting built.  And then the Cloud Plus Edge, which I referenced in the answer to the first question, which is in a multi-Cloud, multi edge world, you still need a control plane that manages all that complexity and that's where something like Azure Arc and GitHub become the two standards. You develop in one place, you deploy in one place, and then you propagate to every Cloud that you want to deploy in.",509.0,241.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.012448132780082987,0.012448132780082987,0.02074688796680498,0.008298755186721992,0.004149377593360996,0.0

But the thing at least about the software businesses are in order to deal with a lot of other constraints, whether they are labor shortages or supply shortages, deploying digital tech is one way to really overcome them.

It was a record quarter, driven by continued strength of the Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $22 billion in revenue, up 32% year-over-year. We are living through a generational shift in our economy and society. Digital technology is the most malleable resource at the world's disposal to overcome constraints and reimagine everyday work and life. We are innovating and expanding our entire portfolio across consumer and commercial segments to help people and organizations thrive in this new era. Now I'll highlight examples, starting with Azure. As every company becomes a digital company, they will need a distributed computing fabric to build, manage, secure and deploy applications anywhere. We have more data center regions than any other provider, delivering fast access to cloud services while meeting data resiliency requirements. We're extending our infrastructure to the 5G network edge, helping operators and enterprises create new business models and deliver ultra-low latency services closer to the end user. AT&T, for example, is bringing together its 5G network with our cloud services to help General Motors deliver next-generation connected vehicle solutions to drivers. Our Azure Arc customer base has tripled year-over-year. We are now helping thousands of organizations from BP to Rabobank unify their on-premise, hybrid and multi-cloud infrastructure. And as the digital and physical worlds come together, we are seeing real enterprise metaverse usage, from smart factories to smart buildings to smart cities, we are helping organizations use the combination of Azure IoT, Digital Twins and Mesh to help digitize people, places and things in order to visualize, simulate and analyze any business process. Ecolab, for example, is using these tools to build its own platform to model and optimize water management. Across Azure, we are seeing growing adoption across every sector. CVS Health, Johnson & Johnson Medical Devices, Kyndryl and Wells Fargo all chose our cloud as their preferred provider this quarter. Now on to data. From best-in-class databases and analytics to AI and data governance, we have the most comprehensive data stack to help every organization turn its data into predictive and analytical power. Cosmos DB is the database of choice for cloud-native app development at any scale. Data volumes and transactions increased over 100% year-over-year. With Azure Synapse, we are removing traditional barriers between enterprise data warehousing and big data analytics, so anyone can collaborate, build and manage analytics solutions. Data governance is emerging as an important and growing category. And Azure Purview is leading here, helping thousands of organizations achieve a more complete understanding of their data estate. In AI, we have one of the most powerful supercomputers in the cloud, and we're using it not only to train new models, but to deliver them as platforms to our customers. Our new Azure OpenAI Service is in preview and that brings together advanced language models with the enterprise capabilities of Azure. GitHub Copilot is using this capability to help developers write better code. More broadly, we continue to see strong usage across our Cognitive Services, with over 30 million hours of speech transcribed last quarter, up nearly 2x compared to a year ago. Now to developers. From GitHub to Visual Studio, to Azure PaaS services, we have the most popular tools to help every developer going from idea to code and code to cloud. As companies prioritize embedding security into their developers’ workflow, we’re investing across GitHub to secure open source. Increasingly, every DevSecOps workflow will start with GitHub Advanced Security, and we’re seeing strong demand from both digital natives like Afterpay and Mercari, as well as established companies like 3M and Bosch. And organizations are increasingly turning to both Visual Studio and our PaaS services, like Container Apps and Chaos Studio, to streamline development and build modern, more resilient cloud-native applications. Now, to Power Platform. Low code/no-code tools are rapidly becoming a priority for every organization’s digital capability building. We’re innovating to help organizations like Airbus, Centrica, and Johnson Controls rapidly scale their use of Power Platform, using end-to-end suite to automate workflows, create applications, build virtual agents, and analyze data. At H&M, more than 30,000 employees have used Power Platform to drive productivity gains. They’ve created more than 1,500 applications, flows, and dashboards to date, for everything from managing office capacity to tracking team goals. And, at Kroger, more than 420,000 associates are using our Return to Workplace solution, which is built on Power Platform, to verify their health and vaccination status. Now, on to Dynamics 365. To counter demand shocks and supply constraints in this economy, every business will need to become a hyperconnected business, unifying data, process, and teams across the organization. Across Dynamics 365, we continue to take share, as companies turn to our expanding portfolio of business applications to address these and other challenges. With Dynamics 365 Connected Spaces, we are creating a new software category to help organizations manage physical operations across diverse industries, from real estate, to retail, to factories, and construction. Companies like Chipotle and Home Depot are relying on our new Customer Experience Platform to take control of their data, connecting customer touchpoints to deliver more personalized experiences. Daimler Trucks North America is using Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Insights to preempt supply chain issues. And, just yesterday, we announced a new Logistics as a Service offering with FedEx, combining data and insights from the company’s network with Dynamics 365 to help brands better fulfill, ship, and service customer orders. Now, on to industry solutions. Just over a year ago, we introduced our first industry cloud offering, bringing together industry-specific customizations with our entire stack to help customers improve time to value, increase agility, and lower costs. We now have six industry clouds, and they’re driving significant increases in usage across the Microsoft Cloud. Our Cloud for Retail was front and center at NRF, with retailers from Ahold Delhaize and GNC are sharing how they’re using our solutions to deliver seamless customer experiences. Our Cloud for Sustainability unifies data to help customers record, report, and reduce their carbon emissions. Industry leaders, including Nissan Motor, are turning to the offering to help meet sustainability goals. Now, on to LinkedIn. We are experiencing a Great Reshuffle across the labor market, as more people in more places than ever rethink how, where, and why they work. In this new economy, LinkedIn has become mission critical to connect creators with their communities, job seekers with employers, learners with skills, and sellers with buyers. Last quarter, we once again saw record engagement. And LinkedIn has become one of the world’s largest platforms for professional events, with more than 24,000 events created and 1.5 million RSVPs each week. Confirmed hires were up 110% year-over-year, and we added tools to make it easier to discover open roles that align with how and where people want to work. With entrepreneurship on the rise, our new Service Marketplace has helped nearly 3 million freelancers and small businesses discover new clients. We also saw strong growth in LinkedIn Sales Solutions, which surpassed $1 billion in revenue over the past 12 months for the first time. Our Sales, Talent, Marketing, and Premium Subscriptions lines of business have now all reached this milestone. Now, on to Microsoft 365 and Teams. Every organization today needs a digital fabric to connect and empower everyone inside and outside the organization, from knowledge and frontline workers to customers and partners. At the center of this digital fabric is Teams, which surpassed 270 million monthly active users this quarter. Organizations are using Teams to run their business with collaborative applications that bring business process data right into the flow of work. Monthly usage of third-party applications and custom-built solutions has grown 10x in the last two years, with new and updated apps this quarter from Atlassian, Monday.com, SAP, and Workday. United Airlines is using bots within Teams to create tighter connections between operations and flight crews. And Marks & Spencer used Power Apps and Teams to streamline internal help desk requests. As hybrid work becomes the norm, every organization will need to rethink their approach to space. With Teams Rooms, we’re bringing Teams to a growing ecosystem of devices to help people stay connected and participate fully in meetings from anywhere. The number of active Teams Rooms devices more than doubled year over year. And with Mesh for Teams, we’re bringing the metaverse to Teams, helping employees at organizations like Accenture access a shared immersive experience where they can have watercooler-type conversations, and even whiteboarding sessions. Teams is rapidly becoming the standard for unified communications. Over 90% of Fortune 500 companies used Teams Phone this quarter, and we continue to take share across PSTN and VOIP as organizations like Bank of Montreal, Chevron, General Motors, LVMH, and NetApp turn to Teams to meet their internal and external collaboration needs. All-up, we’re seeing Teams growth in every segment, from frontline worker usage up 2x year-over-year. Zebra Technologies will bring Teams Walkie Talkie communication to devices used by millions of employees on retail floors. And Walmart chose Teams for their more than 2 million frontline workers this quarter. And we’re expanding our opportunity with Teams Essentials, the first standalone Teams offering specifically designed to meet the needs of small businesses. It’s early days, but we’re already encouraged by strong demand. With Microsoft Viva, we’re creating a new employee experience category, combining communications, knowledge, learning, resources, and insights to help people feel connected to the company’s mission and culture. Now broadly available, Viva is being used by more than 1,000 paid customers including Blum, Nationwide, and REI to help address challenges like employee burnout and retention. All this innovation is driving growth across Microsoft 365. From Heineken to Hilton, to Zurich Insurance, organizations continue to choose our premium E5 offerings for advanced security, compliance, voice, and analytics. Now, on to Windows. We’ve seen a structural shift in PC demand. More than ever, people are turning to PCs to exercise their agency and unleash their creativity, whether it’s meeting in virtual reality or for remote work, writing code or collaborating in documents, livestreaming video or playing games, or for graphic design and engineering design. As new use cases are born every day, and existing ones see a resurgence, we’re experiencing a PC renaissance, with increases in time spent on PCs, and PCs per household. Three months in, we’re delighted by the response to Windows 11. We’re seeing more usage intensity and higher quality than previous versions of our operating system. And Windows took share this quarter. We are delivering Windows in new ways to meet evolving customer needs. This quarter, we introduced Windows 11 SE, a cloud-first operating system purpose-built for schools. And, with Windows 365, we are bringing the operating system to the cloud, helping businesses like Coats North America and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals stream the full Windows experience to any employee device. There are now more than 1.4 billion monthly active devices running Windows 10 or Windows 11, and they’re a powerful on-ramp for both our first-party and third-party services. Windows 11 users engage with the Windows app store at nearly 3x the rate of Windows 10. And, across Bing and Edge, we are creating differentiated, high value experiences for consumers and advertisers in key verticals, including shopping. Just one year since the launch of coupon and price comparison features in Edge, we already have surfaced more than $800 million in savings.  More broadly, we are expanding our opportunity in advertising. Over the past 12 months, our total advertising revenue, inclusive of LinkedIn, surpassed $10 billion ex TAC. And with our acquisition of Xandr, we will bring to market new advertising solutions that combine our deep audience understanding and customer base with Xandr’s large-scale data-driven platforms. Now, on to security. Cybercrime is the number one threat facing every business today. Our aim is to help organizations implement a comprehensive Zero Trust architecture that protects people, devices, applications, and data holistically across their heterogenous cloud and client environments. We protect our customers in two interconnected ways: First, we incorporate security by design into every product we build. And, second, we deliver advanced end-to-end cross-cloud, cross-platform security solutions, which integrate more than 50 different categories across security, compliance, identity, device management, and privacy, informed by more than 24 trillion threat signals we see each day. Among analysts, we are a leader in more security categories now, 19 than any other provider. Our multi-cloud, multi-platform innovation is driving growth. Across commercial and consumer, more than 1 billion monthly active users now rely on a Microsoft Account to securely access their favorite products and services with just one login. More than 15,000 customers now use our cloud-native SIEM, Microsoft Sentinel, to stop threats before they happen, up over 70% year-over-year. And, all-up, the number of customers that use our advanced security solutions accelerated this quarter to over 715,000. More than half have 4 or more workloads, up 75% year-over-year, underscoring our end-to-end differentiation. On average, customers save 60% compared to multi-vendor solutions. As a result of our customers’ trust, our security business revenue surpassed $15 billion over the past 12 months, up nearly 45% year-over-year. Now, on to gaming. The big bets we have made across content, community, and cloud over the past few years are paying off. We saw record engagement, as well as revenue this quarter. Game Pass has more than 25 million subscribers across PC and console. Our differentiated content is driving the service’s growth, and we released new AAA titles this holiday to rave reviews and record usage. 18 million have played Forza Horizon 5 to date. And more than 20 million have played Halo Infinite, making it the biggest Halo launch in history. And with our planned acquisition of Activision Blizzard announced last week, we are investing to make it easier for people to play great games wherever, whenever, and however they want, and also shape what comes next for gaming as platforms like the metaverse develop. In closing, as digital technology as a percentage of global GDP continues to increase, we are innovating and investing across diverse and growing TAMs with common underlying technology stack and an operating model that reinforces a common strategy, culture, and sense of purpose. With that, I’ll hand it over to Amy who will cover our financial results in detail and share our outlook. And I look forward to rejoining you for questions.",2421.0,1397.0,36.0,9.0,5.0,0.0,3.0,8.0,4.0,2.0,0.025769506084466716,0.006442376521116679,0.0035790980672870437,0.0,0.0021474588403722263,0.019327129563350035
MSFT,2022-01-25,2022-01-26,,2022-01-25,2022-01-25T17:30:00-05:00,0,2022-01-25,qa,qna_heading,Amy Hood,"Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone. This quarter, revenue was $51.7 billion, up 20% year-over-year. Earnings per share was 2.48, increasing 22%. The U.S. dollar strengthened during the quarter, and as a result, FX had no impact on total company and segment revenue growth, which was a 1-point headwind compared to expectations. Despite this, we delivered another quarter of strong double-digit revenue growth in each of our business segments, reflecting our unique and differentiated market position across a connected portfolio of diverse businesses. In our commercial business, strong execution by our sales teams and partners combined with continued demand for our Microsoft Cloud offerings drove significant growth in large, long-term Azure contracts, as well as increased usage of Teams and our advanced security and identity offerings. And in LinkedIn, Talent Solutions benefited from a strong job market again this quarter. In our consumer business, increased PC demand and usage, as Satya highlighted, benefitted our Windows OEM business. Continued advertising market growth drove another strong quarter in LinkedIn Marketing Solutions as well as Search and news advertising. And in a strong holiday quarter for gaming, we saw record revenue and engagement on the platform, with significant growth in Game Pass subscribers and first-party titles, as well as continued demand for Xbox Series X and S consoles. Now to our overall results. Commercial bookings grew 32% and 37% in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by the large, long-term Azure contracts noted earlier and strong execution across our core annuity sales motions. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 31% and 32% in constant currency to $147 billion. Roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 26% year-over-year. The remaining portion, which will be recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 37% year-over-year, highlighting the long-term commitment customers are making to the Microsoft Cloud. And our annuity mix increased 1 point year-over-year to 94%. Microsoft Cloud revenue grew 32% to $22.1 billion, again ahead of our expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 70%. Excluding the impact from the change in accounting estimate for the useful life of server and network equipment assets, Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased roughly 3 points driven by improvement across our cloud services, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure. As noted earlier, with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar through the quarter, FX had no company and segment revenue growth impact, and minimal impact on COGS and operating expense growth. Gross margin dollars increased 20%. Gross margin percentage was 67%, relatively unchanged year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points driven primarily by the improvement in our cloud services noted earlier. Operating expense increased 14%, lower than expected, primarily driven by investments that shifted to future quarters. At a total company level, headcount grew 16% year-over-year as we continue to invest in key areas such as cloud engineering, sales, customer deployment, gaming, and LinkedIn. Operating income increased 24% and operating margins expanded 1 point year-over-year to 43%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins expanded roughly 3 points year-over-year. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $15.9 billion and grew 19% year-over-year, which included a 1-point FX headwind relative to expectations. Excluding this headwind, revenue exceeded expectations driven by LinkedIn. Office commercial revenue grew 14%. Office 365 commercial revenue growth of 19% was driven by installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments, as well as higher ARPU. Demand for our advanced security, compliance, and voice offerings drove continued momentum in E5 revenue this quarter. Paid Office 365 commercial seats increased 16% year-over-year, driven by another strong quarter of growth in our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings. Office commercial licensing decreased 17%, in line with expectations and consistent with the ongoing customer shift to the cloud. Office consumer revenue grew 15%, driven by continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 19% to 56.4 million. Dynamics revenue grew 29% year-over-year driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 45% and 44% in constant currency. Continued demand for our modern, low-code app development solutions drove another strong quarter with 161% revenue growth in Power Apps. LinkedIn revenue increased 37% and 36% in constant currency, with continued strength in Marketing Solutions, which grew 43% year-over-year as well as better-than-expected performance in Talent Solutions from the strong job market noted earlier. Segment gross margin dollars increased 20% and 19% in constant currency and gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points driven by improvement across all cloud services. Operating expense increased 13%, and operating income increased 24%. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $18.3 billion, increasing 26% year-over-year, which included a 1-point FX headwind relative to expectations. Excluding this headwind, revenue grew ahead of expectations driven by continued customer demand for our differentiated hybrid and cloud offerings. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue increased 29% year-over-year. Azure and other cloud services growth of 46% was driven by continued strength in our consumption-based services. In our per-user business, the enterprise mobility and security installed base grew 28% to over 209 million seats. In our on-premises business, revenue increased 6%, in line with expectations driven by healthy demand for our hybrid offerings that include Windows Server and SQL Server running in multi-cloud environments. Enterprise Services revenue grew 8% and 7% in constant currency, driven by growth in Enterprise Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 21% and 22% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 2 points year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased slightly with improvements in Azure partially offset by the sales mix shift to Azure. Operating expense increased 14%, and operating income grew 26%. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $17.5 billion, increasing 15% year-over-year, with better-than-expected performance in Windows OEM, Surface, and Search and news advertising. Revenue growth included a 1-point FX headwind relative to expectations. Windows OEM revenue increased 25%, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by the strong PC market noted earlier, particularly in the commercial segment, which has higher revenue per license. As a reminder, these results include roughly 6 points of positive impact from the $210 million revenue deferral related to, which shifted revenue from Q1 to Q2. Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 13% and 14% in constant currency driven by demand for Microsoft 365. Surface revenue grew 8% year-over-year, ahead of expectations as we were able to ship more devices than anticipated into a strong demand environment. Search and news advertising revenue ex TAC increased 32%, better than expected, benefiting from the strong advertising market noted earlier. And, we saw share gains in our Edge browser on Windows 10 and 11 devices. And in Gaming, revenue increased 8%, in line with expectations. Xbox hardware revenue grew 4% and 3% in constant currency driven by continued strong demand and better than expected console supply on a strong prior year comparable that included the launch of the Xbox Series X and S. Xbox content and service revenue increased 10%, lower than expected, as strong growth in first-party titles and Game Pass subscriptions was partially offset by weaker third-party title performance. Segment gross margin dollars increased 20% year-over-year. Gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points, driven by sales mix shift to higher margin businesses and improvement in Search and news advertising. Operating expenses increased 17% driven by investments in Gaming, primarily ZeniMax, Search and news advertising, and Windows marketing. Operating income grew 22% and 21% in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures including finance leases were $6.8 billion, up 25% year-over-year, lower than expected, primarily due to quarterly spend volatility in the timing of our cloud infrastructure buildout. Cash paid for PP&E was $5.9 billion. Our capital investments, including both new data center regions and expansion in existing regions, continue to be based on significant customer demand and usage signals. Cash flow from operations was $14.5 billion, increasing 16% year-over-year as strong cloud billings and collections were partially offset by higher supplier payments related to hardware inventory builds. Free cash flow was $8.6 billion, up 3% year-over-year, reflecting higher capital expenditures in support of our growing cloud business. This quarter, other income and expense was $268 million, higher than anticipated, primarily driven by net gains on investments. Our effective tax rate was approximately 17%. And finally, we returned $10.9 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Now, before we turn to our outlook, I’d like to provide a couple of reminders. First, my remarks for the next quarter do not include the impact from the Nuance acquisition, although we do expect it to close during Q3. Second, the outlook we give, unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S. dollar basis. With that, let’s move to the third quarter outlook. First, FX. With the stronger U.S. dollar and based on current rates, we now expect FX to decrease total revenue growth by approximately 2 points and to decrease total COGS and operating expense growth by approximately 1 point. Within the segments, we anticipate roughly 2 points of negative FX impact on revenue growth in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud and 1 point in More Personal Computing. Next, we expect our differentiated market position, customer demand for our high-value hybrid and cloud offerings, and consistent execution to drive another strong quarter of revenue growth. In commercial bookings, growth should be healthy but will be impacted by the strong prior year comparable as well as low growth in the expiry base. As a reminder, the growing mix of larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be roughly flat year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, Q3 gross margin percentage will increase roughly 2 points driven by continued improvement across all cloud services, despite revenue mix shift to Azure. And, on a dollar basis, we expect capital expenditures to be slightly down sequentially with normal quarterly variability in the timing of the cloud infrastructure buildout. Next to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $15.6 billion and $15.85 billion. In Office 365, healthy revenue growth will be driven by the same factors as Q2 with similar seat growth across customer segments and continued momentum in E5. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the high-teens, with continued customer shift to the cloud. In Office consumer, we expect revenue to grow in the high single-digits, with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 consumer subscriptions. For LinkedIn, the strong job market and healthy engagement on the platform should drive revenue growth in the low-30% range. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the mid-20% range driven by strength in Dynamics 365, including continued momentum in Power Apps. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $18.75 billion and $19 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect revenue growth to be up sequentially in constant currency, driven by our Azure consumption business, with strong growth on a significant base. And our per-user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect some moderation in growth rates given the size of the installed base. In our on-premises server business, continued demand for our differentiated hybrid offerings should drive revenue growth in the low to mid-single-digits. And in Enterprise Services, we expect revenue growth to be in the low to mid-single-digits. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $14.15 billion and $14.45 billion. Continued strength in PC shipments, particularly in the commercial segment, should benefit Windows OEM despite ongoing supply chain constraints. We expect Windows OEM revenue growth in the high single-digits. In Windows commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive growth in the low double-digits. In Surface, revenue should grow in the mid-teens with strength from our premium devices. In Search and news advertising ex-TAC, we expect revenue growth in the mid to high-teens, against a strong prior year comparable that was driven by a recovery in the advertising market. And in Gaming, on a prior year comparable that included significant strength in hardware from our new consoles as well as across Xbox content and services, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits. Console sales will continue to be impacted by supply chain uncertainty. And in Xbox content and services, we expect revenue growth in the mid to high-single digits with strong engagement and continued momentum across the platform. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS of $15.5 billion to $15.7 billion and operating expense of $13.4 billion to $13.5 billion driven by headcount investments in high-growth, strategic areas to drive continued long-term revenue growth. In other income and expense, interest income and expense should offset each other. And we expect our Q3 effective tax rate to be approximately 18%, slightly higher than our full year expected tax rate of approximately 17%. And finally, for FY22, given our strong performance in the first half of the fiscal year and our current H2 outlook, full year operating margins should be slightly up year-over-year even with the impact of changes in accounting estimates noted earlier and the significant strategic investments we are making to capture the tremendous opportunities ahead of us. In closing, digital technologies are increasingly essential to empowering every person and organization on the planet to achieve more and we are well positioned with innovative, high value products. Our diverse, yet connected portfolio of solutions spans end markets, customer sizes and business models, uniquely enabling us to deliver long-term revenue and profit growth.

I wanted to ask you guys a high-level question about the overall demand environment and whether we've seen any changes, given sort of the disruptions we've seen from Omicron and a lot of what's going on in the environment. There's been a narrative among software investors, and a lot of times, the asset prices seem to lead the narrative. So I wanted to check in with you guys on how you feel about the overall demand environment, particularly around digital transformation? And how durable is that going to be into calendar year '22? Do you still see a lot of wood to chop, if you will, a lot of activity taking place in that direction?

Overall, what we see is pretty strong demand signal. And quite frankly, going into the pandemic, we saw demand increase because of the constraints the pandemic put on corporations and the increased consumer activity.  And then coming out of the pandemic, we are seeing actually a lot of constraints in the economy, and the only resource, as I said in my remarks, that can help drive productivity while keeping cost down is digital tech. So when I think -- take something like Power Apps, it's just a great example of something that's right in the middle of our stack, really helps drive that next level of productivity in the labor force for any company in any industry. And so the demand signals we see across the stack from security to our cloud infrastructure to business applications and solutions like Teams is very strong.  And the other area, obviously, we're seeing strength is in gaming. That's where we have doubled down in terms of our consumer category creation. And we see the intensity of usage and the business model diversity around games that increasingly, the economics of gaming franchises is also radically becoming much more software-like. So we sort of overall see good demand signal across the stack.",226.0,112.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03571428571428571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.017857142857142856,0.03571428571428571

And to be clear, the constraints that you talk about for the broader economy, headcount constraints and the like, it doesn't sound like that's constraining your opportunity. You're not kind of running short on people to sell or implement your solutions or not having a hard time finding the people you need to make the investments behind the product.

And you see it even in our OpEx projections that Amy shared. We are growing our headcount because we see the opportunity.

Satya, given all the commentary on the metaverse, what are the key components of the metaverse or the multiple metaverses that you're seeing? What does Microsoft have today that they're positioned to be able to deliver to meet those requirements? And what do you believe you might be lacking if the partner ecosystem meet those requirements? And to Amy, with the hype cycle underway and increased industry interest in the metaverse, are you changing your investments to meet the potential opportunity?",105.0,48.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0625,0.041666666666666664,0.041666666666666664,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.020833333333333332

So the way we see this is as an opportunity in a very classic Microsoft sense, both at the platform infrastructure level and in the application level. So that's why I think even in my remarks, I tried to reference, all the places where we are investing today and seeing customer use cases really develop. At the first place where we see this is the increasing digitization of people, places and things to be able to really help businesses automate processes to the next level. And so today, between Azure IoT, Digital Twins and Mesh, we have many examples where customers are engaged with us. So that's what will show up in Azure and we're investing significantly there. Up the stack, I would say, Dynamics 365 Connected Spaces. That's a solution that's in preview today. That's about really being able to take a retail space or a connected factory or a building and essentially create a complete new software category, which is about managing physical processes, just like CRM and ERP and supply chain management, we now have a suite which is all driven by connected spaces, which is going to automate physical processes. Teams is going to have Mesh meetings. So these immersive meetings, which will start, first of all, on 2D screens, whether it's PCs or phones and then lead up to even immersive experiences if you wear your VR or AR goggles. So that's not of the place. And then, of course, gaming. That will be a natural place for us. And today, if you think about the activity when I talked about the Forza numbers, right, I mean, that's a place where you could say already, people are investing in their avatars. People are building Minecraft worlds. And so very naturally, you can see us extend gaming as the metaverse evolves. On the devices side, one of the things we are very excited to be doing is what we're doing with HoloLens and all the experience we're gaining on the optics, on the silicon side and all the way to the cloud in terms of some of the foundational services driven by all the HoloLens use cases in the enterprise. So that's the broad portfolio. We're going to invest across the entire tech stack. The demand will come in different forms for different categories, but we feel very well positioned to be able to catch. What, I think, is essentially the next wave of the Internet, right? Just like the first wave of the Internet allowed everybody to build a website, I think the next wave of the Internet will be a more open world where people can build their own metaverse world, whether they're organizations or game developers or anyone else.",474.0,219.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0273972602739726,0.0045662100456621,0.0045662100456621,0.0,0.0,0.0228310502283105

And it's because I think of the transition Satya just talked about. If it’s that -- if it's at the platform layer and it applies to all the components, it's better to do that, frankly, across the teams where they can apply it in the right way.

Interestingly, I would not say that there is 1 location, and I would tie that back to the answer actually Satya gave to Keith's first question, which is if the underlying driver is digitization and our belief that it impacts every industry, every end market, then you'd expect it and the nature of the commitments to show themselves on a global basis and across end markets. And that is, in fact, what we saw in Q2. I continually point out, these can be a little volatile because we really focus on getting the right deal done that matches the customer can move around a little bit as I talked about in Q1. But the execution was very good by the sales team this quarter, but I would not characterize any geo or industry as being different or distinct from others. And for a second, let me then connect that, as you asked, into how to think about the guide for Azure on a constant dollar basis being up sequentially into Q3. I sort of continually remark that these can move around a few points here and there and yet have the consistent sign of consumption be steady. And we saw that again, frankly, Q1, Q2, Q3, consumption growth by end market, by industry, by customer size has remained quite steady. And so while you'll see some volatility in that number, increased data usage, the data products have really been a strong performer. I think South mentioned some of those in his comments. So I do think in some ways, they're connected, but I tend to put bookings execution on the Azure side into a long-term commitment bucket where customers are picking a partner to help them change the cost structure or the outcome structure that Satya talked about. And I tend to put these trend lines on Azure into a bucket called, ""Are we getting projects and successful projects set up at customers around the world?"" And both of those things were very good by the sales teams.",344.0,154.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.025974025974025976,0.01948051948051948,0.012987012987012988,0.0,0.012987012987012988,0.006493506493506494

Even with presumably some reversal of work-from-home-related T&E savings, even with what I'm assuming is an uptick in labor cost, can you unpack that a little bit?

Really, I believe that our execution in a very good demand environment has given confidence. Revenue performance has been quite consistent to your point. We have seen some continued upside in OEM. We've seen strength in gaming. We've seen strength in our Microsoft Cloud products. We've seen good consistency out of Dynamics. I mean, at some level, if you really wanted to look at the trend lines, you'd say this has been a very consistent execution by the team across really both of the business units. And so if you think about then what goes into confidence is when you start to add headcount and you add headcount with goals of ROI and you look at that accountability, I feel like the teams have done a nice job. Where we've added heads, they've been into strong markets. They've executed well. Sales teams have done the same. And then on top of that, Karl, I would say there's been good execution on the gross margin numbers. I tend to be an operating margin-focused communicator with you all and inside the company.

Obviously, another strong quarter there, both in terms of revenue but also seat growth. And Amy, in your commentary, you highlighted SMB seat performance as well as frontline workers, and Satya mentioned a doubling of the frontline workers year-over-year, which is impressive. But you also commented on revenue per user going up.

This is 1 where we do have -- it is a P times Q that I think we try to disclose, but there's a couple of currents running through that, maybe take a second to walk you through those. Absolutely on seat growth, I think we are encouraged as we focus on more products that are more specific to the unique scenarios that face small businesses and frontline workers and really bringing the value of Microsoft 365 to them. I think you're even seeing that in offers like Teams Essentials, right? It's a concerted effort to realize the challenges can be different in that part of the market and improving our execution. You're seeing that in continued seat growth over, I would say, I feel good about those numbers, over the past probably 6 quarters with continued good execution on those. Now however, those do often come at lower revenue per month that we would see in our enterprise businesses buying the full suite of products. So in some ways, this very strong seat growth at the frontline worker and small business units do mask some of the progress that we've been making, in particular, I'm thinking offers in the enterprise value props that are really resonating and E5, and Satya may bring up some other ones. He mentioned quite a few in his comments, security, compliance and increasingly, voice as a value prop. And so sometimes, to your point, increasing seats at lower average price points can mask a bit of progress that we're making on ARPUs in the enterprise.",273.0,128.0,7.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0546875,0.015625,0.03125,0.0,0.0,0.0390625

Satya, there's a massive skills gap within the IT industry, and it's particularly acute in cybersecurity, where I noticed Microsoft's campaign that kicked off in Q2 to help scale and recruit 250,000 cyber jobs by 2025, which is quite a bold undertaking.

On the first one, I think it's, first and foremost, we absolutely need the skills and the people. And for the people to be sort of more evenly distributed in the broader economy, public sector, private sector, people who are working on behalf of small businesses because absolutely, as digital tech becomes more pervasive across IT as well as OT across the economy, I think the cyber threat is just going to be more pervasive and so therefore, we need other people on the skills. And we will do our power to sort of make sure that, that happens in terms of democratizing even how 1 acquires these skills. That's kind of where not that we have to take a broader definition of what these skills are and how one can acquire the certifications. And this is where what we're doing even with LinkedIn, I'm very, very bullish on.  On the product side as well, like something like Sentinel, I do believe, for example, we are now doing very large-scale AI on all of those signals that go into our cloud-native SIEM. And that, I think, is going to help sift through signal from noise and help the productivity of the cyber professionals in any organization. So we are excited about how that workflow gets more efficient. To your point, one of the fundamental responsibilities for us as a platform company is to bi-design. It's all about shifting left on security and building it in to the products. And if anything, when we think about our monetization, our monetization is about really recognizing that the real world is not some homogeneous Microsoft infrastructure world. It is a multi-cloud, multi-platform world. And we will definitely monetize those aspects that we have best-of-breed solutions and suites and offerings. And by the way, as I said in my remarks, the people who are adopting the Microsoft solutions are saving 60%. And so to some degree, there is real time to value and cost savings for anybody who's using our solution. So we're going to be very, very mindful of our responsibility as you said. At the same time, we think we have a security opportunity in being able to secure the entire heterogeneous digital estate of our customers.",391.0,168.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.02976190476190476,0.023809523809523808,0.005952380952380952,0.0,0.0,0.005952380952380952

And nice to see continued strength in the business. Maybe I wanted to ask a little bit philosophically, Satya. So the pandemic clearly accelerated everyone's time line to migrate to the cloud, even if there wasn't necessarily a big pull forward there. As we think about a post-Omicron world, where there is some level of office reopenings and visibility into that, how should we think about the potential to see maybe another wave or another acceleration of those cloud migrations with that ability to have in office and have hybrid work?

For example, one of the solutions I highlighted is, coming out of the pandemic, we built in Dynamics a Supply Chain Insights module. We were seeing significant demand for what was our customer insights module going into the pandemic because everybody needed to deploy essentially their online presence and use customer data to be able to reach customers, and that's how commerce happened during the pandemic. Coming out of the pandemic, we were hit with supply chain issues. So supply chain insights became the most important thing. So that's where the demand picked up. So as I look at our portfolio, we are seeing a slightly different set of solutions. Same thing with Power Platform, right? When you are sort of saying we have a labor force shortage and we need to do more with less, guess what, you turn to more automation tools, and that's where something like Power Platform, especially given you can even train your first-line workers to be able to be app builders and automate workflows. That's proving to be a productivity driver. So we are seeing differences in demand. I think the stable state here would be the structural shift that's happened because of the pandemic combined with even some of these constraints, whether there's supply shocks or others will hopefully go away. But the 1 thing that isn't going to go away is the need for increasing levels of digitization, both in terms of tools that people use to improve the productivity of your OpEx and the COGS you have in your enterprise will probably now have a digital component to it because that's where the leverage of cost will come. So that's what we are betting on. As a percentage -- I always go back to that simple formula. As a percentage of GDP, what is IT spend broadly defined and what is it going to be a year from now, 2 years from now, 5 years from now, 10 years from now? It's just going to be more. And we've got to do a good job of seeing the trends before they're conventional wisdom and gaining share.

It was a record third quarter, driven by the continued strength of the Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $23 billion in revenue, up 32% year-over-year. Going forward, digital technology will be the key input that powers the world’s economic output. Across the tech stack, we are expanding our opportunity and taking share as we help customers differentiate, build resilience, and do more with less. Now I’ll highlight examples, starting with Azure. We are building a distributed computing fabric across the cloud and the edge to help every organization build, run, and manage mission-critical workloads anywhere. This quarter, we helped more customers than ever simplifying and accelerating their cloud migrations. And it’s still early days. We are winning Tier 1 infrastructure workloads. Leaders in every industry, from Blackrock, to Bridgestone, to Lufthansa, are all moving mission-critical workloads to Azure. And we are the market leader for customers’ SAP workloads in the cloud. Atos, Chevron, Fujitsu, and Woolworths all migrated their SAP applications to Azure in recent months. Overall, we are seeing larger, more strategic Azure commitments, from industry leaders, including Boeing, Kraft Heinz, US Bank, and Westpac, who all chose our cloud to accelerate their digital transformations. The number of $100 million-plus Azure deals more than doubled year-over-year. And we’re seeing consumption growth across every industry, customer segment, and geography. Now, to data and AI. Our data stack is unique in bringing best-in-class operational databases, analytics, and governance into one integrated data fabric. Cosmos DB transactions and data volume increased over 100% year-over-year for the third quarter in a row. Synapse data volume more than doubled year-over-year. And we’re seeing strong adoption of Purview, as we help organizations govern, protect, and manage their data estate across platforms and clouds. From Deutsche Boerse to EY, customers in every industry are using our end-to-end data platform. In AI, we continue to see strong usage of Azure Machine Learning. The number of monthly inference requests increased 86% year-over-year, with companies like PepsiCo using the service to predict which products are most likely to sell. And our Azure Open AI Service brings together advanced language models with the enterprise capabilities of Azure, helping companies like CarMax turn customer reviews into customized content for shoppers. Now, to developer tools. From Azure DevOps and GitHub to Visual Studio, we have the most comprehensive and loved developer SaaS service. Increasingly, every new developer project starts with our tools. Visual Studio has more than 31 million monthly active users, including most of the Fortune 500. And GitHub usage is increasing among both independent developers and startups, as well as the world’s most established enterprises. 90% of the Fortune 100 use GitHub. In fact, Mercedes Benz, for example, is using GitHub Enterprise to provide a unified development platform for more than 20,000 employees to build, ship, and maintain software. Now, on to Power Platform. Power Platform has become the leading business process automation and productivity suite for domain experts in every industry. Power Platform surpassed $2 billion in revenue over the past twelve months, up 72% year-over-year, making it one of the fastest growing businesses, at scale. Power Apps is the market leader in low code/no code app development, and Power BI has more than 200,000 customers. And our acquisition of MINE-it adds new process mining capabilities, helping organizations identify bottlenecks and opportunities for operational efficiency. Now, to Dynamics 365. Dynamics 365 is growing faster than the business applications market overall. For example, in a world of supply chain constraints we are helping companies like Cracker Barrel and Unilever predict disruptions before they happen. Businesses like Heineken and Siemens are turning to Dynamics 365 to drive and deliver more consistent and personalized customer engagement and service. We are leading innovation in the new industrial metaverse to help companies optimize their operations using technologies such as IOT, Digital Twins, Connected Spaces, and Mixed Reality applications. And we’re further differentiating the Microsoft Cloud by bringing together Dynamics 365, Teams, and Synapse to usher in a new era of collaborative applications that transform every business function and process. When it comes to industry, our six industry clouds, are helping customers speed time to value. Our Cloud for Healthcare was front and center at HIMSS last month, where we introduced Azure Health Data Services to unify disparate clinical, imaging, and medtech data. Cleveland Clinic will use the solution to normalize data from different systems and integrate insights into the clinician workflow. And with our acquisition of Nuance, I’m excited about our opportunity to apply the company’s deep enterprise AI expertise to accelerate the growth of both Nuance’s business, and our industry clouds. Now, on to LinkedIn. We once again saw record engagement, as more than 830 million professionals used the platform to connect, learn, grow, and get hired. Amid the Great Reshuffle, we’re seeing a skills-first labor market emerge. The number of companies using skills filters on LinkedIn to fill open roles has doubled year-over-year. In this dynamic labor market, hires on LinkedIn has increased 88%. Talent Solutions revenue was up 43%, marking the sixth consecutive quarter of accelerating growth. Our Marketing Solutions business continues to thrive as we offer advertisers high reach and ROI. And creators are increasingly turning to the platform to establish their voices and grow their communities, using tools like Newsletters to share content they are passionate about. 28 million members now subscribe to at least one newsletter on LinkedIn, up 51% over the past quarter alone. Now, on to Microsoft 365 and Teams. The last two years have proven that every organization needs a digital fabric that connects the entire organization, from the boardroom to the frontline, to customers and partners. No company is better positioned to meet this need than Microsoft, with Microsoft 365 and Teams. Teams is the most used and most advanced platform for work, and the only solution with meetings, calls, chat, collaboration, and business process automation. And organizations from enterprises to SMBs are relying on Teams to run their business. Our comprehensive approach reduces complexity and costs. Microsoft 365 customers can save as much as 60%, compared to a patchwork of single point identity, productivity, collaboration, and meetings solutions. Teams usage has never been higher. We’re seeing growth in every segment, including very small businesses with Teams Essentials. Teams is the leading platform for collaborative apps. From Asana to Zendesk, there are over 1,000 third-party apps available the Teams app store. And companies in every industry, including CBRE, CVS Health, and the National Health Service in the United Kingdom, have built custom line of business apps within Teams, bringing business process directly into the flow of work. And we’re adding new growth engines to meet the demands of hybrid work with Teams Rooms, Teams Phone, and Microsoft Viva. Teams Rooms is bridging the gap between people working remotely and those in the office, with innovations like Front Row. Teams Phone with Operator Connect enables organizations to easily bring their existing calling service to Teams. Total Operator Connect minutes increased 8x quarter-over-quarter. And Viva has more than 10 million monthly active users at companies like Blum, Cerner, and Marks & Spencer. This quarter, we added LinkedIn’s Glint employee engagement tool to Viva, ensuring leaders can more easily solicit employee feedback and receive actionable insights. All this innovation is driving growth across Microsoft 365. Organizations across the private and public sector, including American Family Insurance, the Queensland Government, and Telefonica are increasingly choosing our premium E5 offerings for advanced security, compliance, voice, and analytics. Now, on to Windows. The PC has never been more relevant to work, life, and play. The number of use cases is increasing as is the amount of time spent on PCs. More than 100 million PCs have shipped in each of the last eight quarters, and Windows continues to take share. With Windows 11, we continue to see the highest quality scores of any version of the operating system. The enterprises are adopting Windows 11 at a faster pace than any previous release. With Windows 365, we’re bringing the power of Azure computing to Windows computers, enabling businesses like Lands’ End, SES, and Xerox to stream the full Windows experience to any employee device. New integrations between Windows 11 and Windows 365 will make it possible to switch between Cloud PC and the local PC with a single click. And we continue to help organizations like AIG, Grant Thornton, and Sage shift their on-premise virtualization services to the cloud with Azure Virtual Desktop. In consumer, Windows is key to curating our content and services to help every person with their everyday tasks, from browsing and searching, to learning, and gaming, and shopping, all with security and privacy built-in. We are seeing strong engagement, with nearly 500 million monthly active users of our personalized content feed, Microsoft Start. As usage continues to grow, we are seeing a flywheel emerge between content, consumption, and commerce, as we generate new opportunities for content creators, as well as advertisers. And our browser, Microsoft Edge, continues to gain share as we help people save money and shop securely. Now, to security. Security is a top priority for every organization undergoing a digital transformation. To keep our customers secure, we build security by design into every product we sell. And we deliver end-to-end solutions spanning security, compliance, identity, device management, and privacy, across clouds and platforms, informed by 24 trillion threat signals each day. This comprehensive capability has been critical during the recent world events, and we continue to disrupt cyber attacks and share threat intelligence with the Ukrainian government, as well as other public sector agencies. Multi-cloud, multi-platform support is central to our approach. In security, we are the only cloud provider with native multi-cloud protection for the industry’s top three cloud platforms. In identity, we now provide permissions management across all clouds. Azure Active Directory is the undisputed market leader with more than 550 million monthly active users. In management, the number of Windows, Android, and iOS devices protected by Intune grew over 60% year-over-year. And we’re expanding to new market segments with Microsoft Defender for Business, which helps keep small businesses secure. This innovation and differentiation is driving our overall growth. All up, the number of customers who trust our security solutions grew nearly 50% year-over-year to 785,000, including Citrix, Domino’s Pizza, Fujitsu, Heineken, Petronas, who rely on us to protect their multi-cloud infrastructure. And we have over 15,000 partners in our security ecosystem, more than anyone else in the industry. Now, on to gaming. Our ambition is to power gamers to play when, and how, and where they want. With our Xbox Series S and X consoles, we have taken share globally for two quarters in a row and we are the market leader this quarter among the next gen consoles in the United States, Canada, UK, and Western Europe. And with Xbox Cloud Gaming, we are redefining how games are distributed, played, and viewed. To date, more than 10 million people have streamed games. Many of our most popular titles, including Flight Simulator are now accessible on phones, tablets, low-spec PCs for the first time. Our Game Pass library now includes hundreds of titles across PC and console, including more games from third-party publishers than ever before. Billions of hours have been played by subscribers over the past 12 months, up 45%. And with Azure, we are building the best cloud for game studios of all sizes to build, host, and grow their games. New capabilities speed time to development and to help connect players across platforms. Azure gaming revenue fiscal year to date increased 66%. In closing, we are entering a new era where every company will become a digital company. Our portfolio of durable digital businesses and diverse business models, built on a common tech stack, position us well to capture the massive opportunities ahead. With that, I’ll hand it over to Amy.",1997.0,1129.0,35.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,3.0,10.0,3.0,1.0,0.03100088573959256,0.0044286979627989375,0.0044286979627989375,0.0,0.002657218777679362,0.026572187776793623
MSFT,2022-04-26,2022-04-27,,2022-04-26,2022-04-26T17:30:00-04:00,0,2022-04-26,qa,qna_heading,Amy Hood,"Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $49.4 billion, up 18% and 21% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.22 and increased 14% and 18% in constant currency when adjusted for the tax benefit from the third quarter of fiscal year 2021. Several items impacted our financial performance that were not included in the guidance provided on our January earnings call. First, Nuance. My comments today across Q3 results and Q4 outlook include the impact from the Nuance acquisition which closed on March 4. Our results include $111 million in revenue and a negative $0.01 impact to earnings per share, including purchase accounting, integration, and transaction related expenses. Within our results, unless specifically noted otherwise, Nuance was not a material driver of growth rates. We continue to expect the Nuance acquisition will be minimally dilutive in FY2022 and accretive in FY2023 to non-GAAP EPS. Second, FX. The U.S. dollar strengthened throughout the quarter and created an incremental 1 point FX headwind to total company revenue compared to expectations. As a result, revenue and EPS were negatively impacted by $302 million and $0.03 per share, respectively. Finally, the war in Ukraine. We suspended all new sales of our products and services in Russia. Revenue generated in Russia represents less than 1% of total company revenue and we expect that it will decline significantly. The impact to operating income this quarter was roughly $130 million split evenly between lower revenue and higher bad debt expense, resulting in a negative $0.01 impact to EPS. Our results for the quarter are better than we expected across revenue, operating income, and EPS as we again delivered another strong quarter of top and bottom line growth. In our commercial business, healthy demand for our differentiated hybrid and cloud offerings together with excellent execution by our sales teams and partners drove increased commitment to our platform as well as higher usage of our services that Satya mentioned earlier. Commercial bookings increased 28% and 35% in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations driven by strong execution across our core annuity sales motions. We also saw better than expected growth in large, long-term Azure contracts against a very strong prior year comparable. Nuance benefited bookings by roughly 5 points. Our on-premises transactional licensing revenue, across both the Office and Server businesses, was more negatively impacted than expected due to the transition from our Open Licensing program to our Cloud Solution Provider program. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 32% and 34% in constant currency to $155 billion with a roughly equivalent split between the revenue that will be recognized within and the portion beyond, the next 12 months. And our annuity mix increased 2 points year-over-year to 96%. Commercial Cloud revenue was $23.4 billion and grew 32% and 35% in constant currency, again ahead of expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 70%. Excluding the impact from the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, the Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased roughly 3 points driven by improvement across the cloud services, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure. In our consumer business, as you heard from Satya, we saw market share gains across PCs, gaming consoles, and our Edge browser. Now back to the company level. As noted earlier, the U.S. dollar strengthened throughout the quarter. FX decreased total company revenue by 3 points, 1 point unfavorable to expectations, decreased COGS by 1 point, in line with expectations, and decreased operating expense growth by 2 points, 1 point favorable to expectations. Gross margin dollars increased 18% and 21% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 68%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased approximately 1 point driven primarily by improvement in our cloud services noted earlier. Operating expense increased 15% and 17% in constant currency, slightly lower than expected as investments that shifted to future quarters were partially offset by the inclusion of Nuance. At a total company level, headcount grew 20% year-over-year as we continue to invest in key areas such as cloud engineering, customer deployment, LinkedIn, and sales, and included approximately 4 points of growth from the addition of Nuance. Operating income increased 19% and 23% in constant currency and operating margins increased slightly year-over-year to 41%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins expanded roughly 2 points year-over-year. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $15.8 billion and grew 17% and 19% in constant currency in line with expectations. Better than expected results across Office 365, LinkedIn, and Office consumer were offset by impacts from incremental FX, the Open Licensing transition, Russia, as well as lower than expected results in Dynamics. Office commercial revenue grew 12% and 14% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 17% and 20% in constant currency, driven by installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments, as well as higher ARPU from continued momentum in E5 revenue. Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 16% year-over-year to nearly 345 million, with continued growth in our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings. And nearly 45% of our Office 365 commercial seats were purchased through Microsoft 365. Office commercial licensing was lower than expected, down 28% and 25% in constant currency, driven by the factors discussed earlier and a lower mix of contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition. Office consumer revenue grew 11% and 12% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 16% to 58.4 million. Dynamics revenue grew 22% and 25% in constant currency driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 35% and 38% in constant currency, substantially faster than the market although a bit lower than expected as we focus on stronger execution on our recent investments. LinkedIn revenue increased 34% and 35% in constant currency, with better than expected performance in Talent Solutions as well as continued strength in Marketing Solutions and record levels of engagement on the platform. Segment gross margin dollars increased 16% and 19% in constant currency and gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points driven by improvement across all cloud services. Operating expense increased 13% and 14% in constant currency, and operating income increased 19% and 23% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes approximately four weeks of results from Nuance. Revenue was $19.1 billion, increasing 26% and 29% in constant currency. Excluding the impact of Nuance and the approximately $150 million greater FX than expected, revenue results were ahead of expectations. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue increased 29% and 32% in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services grew 46% and 49% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by continued strength in our consumption-based services. The inclusion of Nuance cloud services did not change the Azure constant currency growth rate. In our per-user business, the enterprise mobility and security installed base grew 25% to over 218 million seats. In our on-premises server business, revenue increased 5% and 7% in constant currency, ahead of expectations driven by healthy demand for our hybrid offerings partially offset by the Open Licensing transition mentioned earlier. The inclusion of Nuance on premises offerings did not change the server constant currency growth rate. Enterprise Services revenue grew 5% and 6% in constant currency, driven by growth in Enterprise Support Services. The inclusion of Nuance professional services impacted the constant currency growth rate by 1 point. Segment gross margin dollars increased 24% and 27% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 1 point year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point with improvements in Azure partially offset by the sales mix shift to Azure. Operating expense increased 17% and 19% in constant currency and operating income grew 29% and 33% in constant currency. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $14.5 billion, increasing 11% and 13% in constant currency, above expectations driven by better than expected performance in search and Windows offset by Surface. FX decreased segment revenue approximately $100 million greater than expected. Windows OEM revenue increased 11%, with continued strength in the commercial PC market, which has higher revenue per license. Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 14% and 19% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by demand for Microsoft 365 with some benefit from a greater mix of contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition. Surface revenue grew 13% and 18% in constant currency, lower than expected, driven by consumer channel, partially offset by strength in commercial. Search and news advertising revenue ex-TAC increased 23% and 25% in constant currency, better than expected, benefiting from an increase in search volumes even as we saw headwinds during March from the impact of the war in Ukraine. And in Gaming, on a high prior year comparable, revenue increased 6% and 8% in constant currency. Xbox hardware revenue was better than expected as increased supply of consoles in quarter drove growth of 14% and 16% in constant currency. Xbox content and services revenue grew 4% and 6% in constant currency, below expectations, driven by lower engagement across the platform, even as it remains above pre-pandemic levels. Segment gross margin dollars increased 10% and 13% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased slightly. Operating expenses increased 17% and 18% in constant currency and operating income grew 7% and 10% in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures including finance leases were $6.3 billion, in line with expectations. Cash paid for PP&E was $5.3 billion. Cash flow from operations was $25.4 billion, increasing 14% as strong cloud billings and collections were partially offset by higher supplier payments related to hardware inventory builds as we manage continued uncertainty in the supply chain. Free cash flow was $20.0 billion, up 17%. This quarter, other income and expense was negative $174 million, lower than anticipated driven by net losses on investments, including mark-to-market losses on our equity portfolio, and net losses on foreign currency remeasurement. Equity market declines drove net investment losses this quarter compared to net investment gains last year, a negative 2-point impact on year-over-year EPS growth. Our effective tax rate was approximately 17%. And finally, we returned $12.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Now, before we turn to our outlook, a few reminders. First, FX; with the stronger U.S. dollar and based on current rates, we now expect FX to decrease total company revenue growth by approximately 2 points and to decrease total COGS and operating expense growth by approximately 1 point. Within the segments, we anticipate roughly 3 points of negative FX impact on revenue growth in Productivity and Business Processes and 2 points in Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing. Second, my remarks for the next quarter include a full quarter of impact from the Nuance acquisition. Third, we anticipate the war in Ukraine to continue to impact our business in Q4 with a roughly $110 million impact on revenue and minimal impact on operating expenses. Next, we have taken into account the current impact of shutdowns in China in our outlook. However, extended production shutdowns that reach into May would further negatively impact our outlook across Windows OEM, Surface, and Xbox hardware. Finally, the outlook we give, unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a USD basis. With that context in place, let’s turn to our Q4 outlook. In our largest quarter of the year we expect our differentiated market position, customer demand across the solution portfolio, and consistent execution to drive another strong quarter of revenue growth. In commercial bookings, a growing Q4 expiry base, strong execution across our core annuity sales motions, and increased commitment to our platform should drive healthy growth against a strong prior year comparable. As a reminder, the growing mix of larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, always drives increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be down roughly 1 point year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, Q4 gross margin percentage will increase roughly 1 point driven by continued improvement across our cloud services partially offset by a revenue mix shift to Azure. Capital expenditures, we expect a sequential increase on a dollar basis as we continue to invest to meet growing global demand for our cloud services. Next to segment guidance; in Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $16.65 billion and $16.9 billion. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with healthy seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth thru E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be sequentially lower by a point or two on a constant currency basis. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline similar to last quarter. In Office consumer, we expect revenue to grow in the high single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the high-20s driven by the strong job market and healthy engagement on the platform. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth similar to last quarter. For Intelligent Cloud we expect revenue between $21.1 billion and $21.35 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure which as a reminder can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. We expect Azure revenue growth to be sequentially lower by roughly 2 points on a constant currency basis with a bit more FX impact on U.S. dollar growth than at the segment level. Azure revenue will continue to be driven by strong growth in our consumption business. And our per-user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect moderation in growth rates given the size of the installed base. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline in the low-to-mid single digits as demand for our hybrid offerings will be more than offset by the strong prior year comparable, which included 4 points of benefit from contracts with higher in period revenue recognition, as well as continued transactional weakness from the licensing program transition noted earlier. And in Enterprise Services, we expect revenue growth to be in the high single digits. In more Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $14.65 billion and $14.95 billion. As mentioned earlier, our guidance reflects the current constraints from the shutdowns in China, which have negatively impacted Q4 supply for OEM, Surface and Xbox consoles. In Windows OEM we expect revenue growth in the low-to-mid-single digits driven by the continued shift to a commercial-led PC market where revenue per license is higher. In Windows commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive growth in the low-double digits. In Surface, revenue should grow in low-double digits. In Search and news advertising ex-TAC, we expect revenue growth of approximately 20%. And in Gaming, we expect revenue to decline in the mid-to-high single digits driven by lower engagement hour’s year-over-year as well as constrained console supply. We expect Xbox content and services revenue to decline mid-single digits though engagement hours are expected to remain higher than pre-pandemic levels. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS of $16.6 billion to $16.8 billion and operating expense of $14.8 billion to $14.9 billion resulting in another quarter of operating margin expansion excluding the change in useful life. We expect other income and expense to be negative $50 million reflecting FX remeasurement impact based on market conditions in April. Similar to the rest of our guidance, further equity and FX movements through Q4 are not reflected in this number. As a reminder, we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio, which can increase quarterly volatility. And we expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be approximately 18%. We expect to close FY22, even in a more complex macro environment, with the same consistency we have delivered throughout the year. With strong revenue growth, share gains, and improved operating margins as we invest in the areas that are key to sustaining that growth. As we look toward FY23, our track record of delivering high value to our customers across many diverse and durable growth markets gives us confidence that we will drive continued healthy double-digit revenue and operating income growth.

And what we see is a pretty difficult climate out there. Definitely from the stock market perspective, but if we think about interest rates, we think about inflation, there’s a, a conflict going on in Europe right now. It does seem to be a tough backdrop. You guys are operating super well. I mean, the acceleration in Azure at that scale is truly awesome. And so if I’m not mistaken Office 365 commercial accelerated as well in the quarter, so really impressive results. But I think the question that most investors are going to have is where do you garner the confidence and the durability of this growth given how volatile this macro backdrop is? Is it conversations you are having with customers? Is it what you see in the backlog? Maybe if you could give us some kind of insight into what gives you guys the confidence to put out that guide, to put out those healthy comments for FY23, what are you seeing that could maybe help us give us and give investors a little bit more confidence in the durability of this growth in this environment?",204.0,92.0,3.0,6.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.03260869565217391,0.06521739130434782,0.05434782608695652,0.0,0.0,-0.03260869565217391

Maybe at three levels Keith, one is just the competitiveness of our tech stack all up sort of from infrastructure all the way to the SaaS applications when it comes to the commercial cloud and as well as how we are able to monetize for example, the install base of our consumer franchises as well. So both of these places we feel we are competitive and increasingly so coming out of the pandemic to gain share. I’d also say that in many of these places, we have price leadership. I mean, take the one point I made which is, if there is any macro-headwind where you have more value for less price means you win. And in our case, when it comes to our commercial cloud offerings we have significant advantages on that across the stack. The second thing is in the conversations we are having with our customers. The interesting thing I find from perhaps even past challenges whether macro or micro is no, I don’t hear of businesses looking to their IT budgets or digital transformation projects is the place for cuts, if anything, some of these projects are the way they’re going to accelerate their transformation or for that matter automation for example. I have not seen this level of demand for automation technology to improve productivity because in an inflationary environment, the only deflationary force is software. So that’s the second micro thing the tone thing that’s different. At the end of the day though, I mean, none of us here are trying to forecast macro. So all we think of is the TAMs that we are competing in a large, as a percentage of GDP tech spend is on a secular basis by the end of the decade going to double. We just want to keep driving usage, driving share and be competitive, so that’s kind of how we view what we are doing. And that’s where our confidence comes from in terms of our outlays, whether it’s OpEx or CapEx.

You talked about it as the TAM that we’re focused on. I would say also, there’s still a lot of that TAM left to go – left to go after and it is quite early, still. And the transitions you’re talking about from a digital transformation perspective, from an automation perspective, from a type of value and real productivity enhancements that can be made. And so I think the continuity of the execution has certainly been very good from the sales and partner side.

I generally follow the same principle I try to follow, which is I give you my best knowledge as of today. I did note and tried to do that with a lot of clarity that were the production shutdowns to extend into May, there would be further negative impact on those from a supply constraint position. As you know, on the OEM business, that revenue is recognized at the point of production and then for Xbox consoles as well as Surface it’s a sell-in. So production delays even earlier in May can obviously have big impact on the quarter.

Very specifically Mark, I would say, this quarter was quite similar in nature to what you saw in the past few. Seat growth while across all segments was especially good in frontline worker and SMB. That did mask a little bit as it often does the ARPU improvement, given those tend to be lower priced SKUs, the ARPU improvement that we’re seeing from the transitions into E5. The transition from E3 to E5 still has opportunity. I would say, we’re in the earlier transitions of that show in terms as, I think, about going forward there is certainly still room for both seat growth specifically and frontline worker, as you noted as well as SMB. And then ARPU expansion through the E5 transition. The thing I would add that Satya mentioned in his comments and again in his first answer is really the value that is available to customers in E5, whether that is security, whether it’s compliance, whether it’s phone, whether it’s analytics, the value of that suite, and if you think even more broadly, the value of Microsoft 365, which adds in more components around Windows. I think we are offering high value and that tends to give us some optimism that we can continue to execute well in that segment.

I mean, I think, the fundamentals are pretty strong here still, whether it’s E5 growth, SMB growth, frontline worker, I’d also add emerging markets. I mean, this is the first time I feel that we have products that fit just emerging markets like Teams Essentials, where we can even really penetrate markets that we’ve never sold anything in the past. And then the new growth engines that you talked about, Teams Phones, Teams Rooms, Viva and even Windows 365 are all things that we can again, drive growth from. And the point about sort of our value is probably a very, very strong in a time like this in particular. And we see it like the one thing also I’d say is the usage data that we are seeing is peak everywhere.

Is that something that you would characterize as Microsoft specific, as you describe in your comments, your transitioning customers off your Open License program?

I would say it does not feel like the tilt from on-prem to cloud felt any different in a way that would have impacted the quarter anymore, so than it normally does in terms of the normal transitions. We’ve seen to your point on Office or frankly, even in server, as we have people move those workloads and migrate those workloads to the cloud. This really was very significant. Think of it as a where partners transact. And we have such a broad, and valuable, and really needed partner community that is very vast. And we put this and had planned for this change for January 1. And we executed the change on January 1 as plan, and it’s just taking us a little longer to onboard all of this community to make sure that they can transact the way they want to in the program. So, I do think it’s going to take us longer than we thought, we’re going to continue to see that impact in Q4.

And so, it’s sort of, will always have some amount of volatility that even Amy referenced quarter-over-quarter. But if I walk up, one thing that we look at is growth coming from all segments, right? So small business and enterprise, is it coming from all regions? And it is. We also look at the type of workloads it’s coming from. And so it looks healthy in all of those. And if you walk up the stack to your point on the infrastructure side, the Tier 1 workloads is where I think we are seeing some big Tier 1 workloads, and I had many comments on SAP and other workloads moving. The second thing I’d say is on the past services and our DevFest that’s another area where we have differentiated value. So we see good growth there. Data and AI for sure, I mean, the thing that I find really to be something that I think the long run is going to probably be one of the bigger drivers of our growth and differentiation is our data fabric, because we are the only guys who have a complete data fabric from the operational store that’s fully integrated into an analytics engine that’s fully integrated into governance. And that increasingly is going to become more and more important, right? I mean you can be dealing with this a new regulation coming on privacy and governance on one end and your operational store being divorced from that. So we have a very differentiated offer and I talked about some of the growth numbers there. The AI inference is also finally kicking. They’re very small today, but even when I look at the total com – that’s just essentially a compute meter, there’s growth there. So overall, I think we will see quarter-over-quarter, some cyclicality, depending on which customers. In fact, we pay people at Microsoft to reduce customer bills and which we should. So given that we may see cyclicality in terms of how optimizations happen, but overall we’re still very early on as the world sort of migrates to the cloud and users, essentially cloud infrastructure and compute is sort of to drive their operational efficiencies and product.",419.0,181.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,0.011049723756906077,0.011049723756906077,0.022099447513812154,0.0055248618784530384,0.0055248618784530384,0.0

Satya, I have very clearly on your comments and particularly you talked about tech as a percentage of GDP doubling over the next seven, eight years or so. Nobody could have really predicted maybe besides yourself, that Azure would be this big and growing this fast at this point in time relative to say five, six years back.

What happens with infrastructure, whenever something can be 10x better. So for example, when we talk about the next generation of multi-edge, multi-cloud, infrastructure remaining one of the leaders, that’s going to be a massive EV creation as a percentage of GDP tech spend double. So that’s where everything from Azure, Azure, our database, our – all of that’s super important. The other one is, this is sort of age of AI. In other words, the core business logic is not being written. It’s being written by software. So when I look at, when I use get up co-pilot, that’s the therein lies the future of what how all business logic gets written. And so to me the AI layer, both the training, supercomputers, as well as the inference layer that’s a place where you’ll see us integrate what today you all consider to be two different businesses, whether it’s Azure and Windows, they’re just one business to me, because to me, where in training happens, where inference happens will be written once by developers. And then it’ll light up across this distributed fabric. So that’s another place where I think there’s tons of enterprise value that’ll get created over time. And then of course the UI layer always is the biggest one. And the next inflection point, whether it’s what happens with MetaWare, so what happens with even on the industrial side with IoT and digital twins those are all things that I think will be the ones that we will be focused on.

We are sort of working at them workload at a time, and so we feel very, very good about both the type of workloads. In fact, I – there is a migration of a bunch of workloads that we may have won in the client server that are migrating, but the most exciting thing is the type of Tier 1 workloads that we have never seen run on any Microsoft infrastructure that’s running on Azure today and being optimized on Azure. So that’s the thing that we see as we win these large strategic deals. On Nuance, for me, the thing that’s exciting is Nuance is a platform layer for these AI driven applications that are getting deployed, whether it’s in healthcare or even in the enterprise contact center. So we are very excited about Nuance now being part of the Microsoft family.

I tend to mention the impact of large long-term Azure contract, both in the context of commercial bookings and some volatility we often can see in that because of it. But really, I think the way we think about them maybe outside of this phone call, is that it’s the beginning of the commitment between us and a customer to start to work together to deliver value. And so we go workload by workload, opportunity by opportunity and I think that’s what you were inferring a bit is that it’s almost the top of the funnel to create value for the customer. We call it delivering success to make sure they’re spending the dollars the most effective way, making sure we’re tackling the hardest problems that they need solved. And with that comes our investments that we’ve made and deployment resources and usage resources specifically in Azure to make that possible with customers.

And really the more important related part is given the outlook that you may have for the PC market. How are you thinking about the durability of the Windows side of your business?

So I think on the commercial side, I think it’s well understood is that Windows is the socket for Microsoft 365. We have tremendous value, Amy referenced this earlier. In fact, we just launched Windows 11 and pro value with Windows 365, that’s resonating super well. The customer sat adoption rates when it comes, whether it’s security, whether it’s our productivity, we feel good about the commercial business. So we’ll stay focused on it on the commercial side. And on the consumer side, the coming out again the pandemic, the intensity of the usage has gone up. So one of the areas of focus for us is some of the stuff that I talked about in my remarks is just the usage, right? So where – when you think about 500 million users engaging with Microsoft start, that’s not the type of engagement we had. And so with a large installed base now, we have a significant room there, the browser share growth, we have significant room there. And then, of course, the subscription attaches whether it’s gaming or whether it’s productivity or suites. So that’s kind of how I look at what we are going to do at least in the immediate future. PC remains a very important category and I think people’s lives is what we’ve discovered during the pandemic. And if anything, the intensity of usage is increased.

Amid this macroeconomic environment, the Microsoft Cloud surpassed $25 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time, up 28% and 33% in constant currency. When I talk with customers, it's clear there is a real opportunity to help organizations in every industry use digital technology to overcome today's challenges and emerge stronger. In this environment, we are focused on 3 things: first, no company is better positioned than Microsoft to help organizations deliver on their digital imperative so that they can do more with less. From infrastructure and data to business applications and hybrid work, we provide unique differentiated value to our customers. Second, we will invest to take share and build new businesses in categories where we have long-term structural advantage. Lastly, we will manage through this period with an intense focus on prioritization and executional excellence in our own operations to drive operational leverage. With that, let me highlight our progress, starting with Azure. Organizations in every industry continue to choose our cloud to align their IT investments with demand. We are seeing larger and longer-term commitments and won a record number of $100 million-plus and $1 billion-plus deals this quarter. We have more data center regions than any other provider, and we will launch 10 regions over the next year. Our new Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty helps public sector customers meet urgent compliance, security and privacy requirements. With Azure Arc, we are meeting customers where they are enabling companies like GM, Greggs, UBS and Uniper to run applications across on-prem edge and multi-cloud environments. We are seeing more customers move their mission-critical workloads to Azure. American Airlines, for example, chose our cloud to run its key operational workloads, including its data warehouse. And Telstra will move its internal IT workloads to Azure. And we are the platform of choice for SAP apps on the cloud. Leaders in every industry, including Kraft Heinz, Fujitsu and Unilever have migrated ERP workloads to Azure. Just last week, we announced a new service to accelerate adoption of Oracle workloads on Azure. We are the only public cloud with simplified direct access to Oracle databases running in the Oracle Cloud. Now on to data and AI. With our Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform, we provide a complete data fabric spanning operational databases, analytics and governance, helping customers focus on creating value instead of integrating fragmented data estate. More than 65% of the Fortune 1000 use 3 or more of our data solutions, and we are growing faster than the market. We are seeing leaders in every industry from La Liga and Lenovo to Swiss Re and Walgreens unify their data using our tools. Cosmos DB is the go-to database powering the world's most demanding mission-critical workloads at any scale. Transactions in data volume increased over 100% year-over-year for the fourth quarter in a row. When it comes to AI, we are seeing a paradigm shift as the world's large AI models become powerful platforms themselves. With our Azure OpenAI service, a diverse set of customers from HSBC, PwC and RTL Group to Shell and Wipro are applying language models to advanced scenarios like content and code generation. Now on to developer tools. We have the most popular developer tools across any cloud and any platform. Leaders in every industry from Ahold Delhaize to KPMG to Philips are all choosing GitHub to build software. GitHub Copilot is the first-of-its-kind AI pair programmer, which helps developers write better code faster. More than 400,000 people have subscribed since we made it generally available a month ago. And with our expanding portfolio of container services, organizations like H&M can build modern, more resilient cloud-native applications. All up, revenue from Azure container services increased by triple digits. Now on to Power Platform. With Power Platform, we are helping domain experts rapidly drive productivity gains at a time when it's never been more important. We now have nearly 25 million monthly active users, and we are innovating to make it even easier for teams of pro and citizen developers to build end-to-end business solutions together. AB InBev, ARM, Equinor, Toyota, Vodafone and Zurich Insurance have all built centers of excellence to train employees at scale on how to use Power Platform. PG&E, for example, expects to save at least 720,000 hours by eliminating redundant and manual processes across employee workflows. Now on to Dynamics 365. We are helping organizations digitize their customer experience, service, finance and supply chain functions as we continue to outgrow the market in every category. Our new Microsoft Digital Contact Center Platform brings together Dynamics 365, Microsoft Teams as well as enterprise AI capabilities from Nuance to help customers like HP deliver omnichannel customer engagement. And new integrations between Dynamics 365 and Intelligent Order Management and Teams help people collaborate in the flow of work to overcome supply chain disruptions. We are winning customers as we help organizations address their most pressing challenges. Pete's Coffee is modernizing its supply chain with our business applications. Carlsberg is standardizing its field service and customer service operations. And Visa switched to Dynamics 365 for both its sales and call center organizations. When it comes to our industry and cross-industry clouds, we are seeing strong adoption as we take a platform-driven approach to help organizations deliver on their digital imperative. For example, Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare, inclusive of Nuance, is becoming the platform of choice for companies across the health care value chain, looking to drive meaningful clinical and financial outcomes. Whether it's a provider modernizing care delivery, a health plan transforming the member experience or a retailer expanding into health services, having a technology partner that is truly dedicated to empowering their success is a significant differentiator for us. Intermountain Healthcare, for example, chose the Cloud for Healthcare as well as Nuance's DAX Ambient Intelligence solution as the pillar of its new digital strategy. Now on to Microsoft 365 and Teams. In this economic environment, every organization is looking to support employee flexibility and improve productivity. Hybrid work is now just work, and it's imperative that organizations reconnect and re-engage the work force at home and office and everywhere in between. To do this companies need a digital fabric that connects employees as well as customers and partners wherever and whenever they work while reducing cost and complexity. We’re all in on Teams. Over the past year we’ve introduced more than 450 capabilities to empower frontline and knowledge workers to collaborate synchronously and asynchronously as well as remote and in-person. Teams is taking share across every category from collaboration to chat to meetings to calling and seeing higher usage intensity as companies turn to the platform to accelerate their digital transformation and orchestrate all their business process in the flow of work. ISVs from Adobe to Workday have built deep integrations with Teams. And more than 100,000 companies, including Johnson & Johnson, Lumen Technologies and Progressive Insurance have deployed custom line of business applications in Teams. All up, the number of third-party and LOB apps with active usage increased by 40% year-over-year. Teams Phone is the market leader in cloud calling across VoIP and PSTN. We now have over 12 million PSTN users, nearly double the number a year ago. And Teams Rooms bridges the gap between people working remotely and those in the office with innovations like AI-powered cameras. More than 60% of the Fortune 500 have chosen Teams Rooms to connect employees across the hybrid workplace. We're also building a completely new suite with Microsoft Veeva as we create a new employee experience category. This is both a priority for our customers and an expansive and high-growth TAM for us. 25% of the Fortune 500 already use Veeva as organizations increasingly recognize that employee experience and well-being are essential to their productivity. We have seen broad adoption across segments and industries from Commonwealth Bank, Fidelity Investments and Mastercard to AstraZeneca and Schlumberger. And this innovation is driving revenue growth across Microsoft 365. Asahi, Expedia Group and Qualcomm all chose our premium offerings to transform how employees work. E5 seats increased more than 60% year-over-year. Now on to Windows. With Windows, we are putting people at the center to help them securely work, connect and play. Despite a changing market for PCs during the quarter, we continue to see more PCs shipped than pre pandemic and are taking share. And we are seeing higher monthly usage of Windows 11 applications with increased time spent across creative work, collaboration, gaming, media and writing code as people rely on the PC for its unique productivity capabilities, rich interactive experiences and to stay connected. We are transforming how Windows is experienced and managed with Azure Virtual Desktop and Windows 365. Azure Virtual Desktop monthly active usage increased nearly 60% year-over-year. One year in, we are seeing strong adoption of Windows 365 from organizations in every industry from Hamburg Commercial Bank and Kyndryl to LEGO Group and Schroders as they use cloud PCs to rapidly onboard new and temporary employees and speed M&A integration while reducing IT costs. Now on to security. As the rate and pace of threats continue to accelerate, security is the top priority for every organization. We provide comprehensive solutions that integrate more than 50 categories informed by more than 43 trillion signals each day, reducing cost and complexity. We're taking share across all major categories we serve. All up, our security revenue increased 40%. We are the only cloud provider with protection for the top 3 cloud platforms, and we are seeing more and more customers turn to us to protect their multi-cloud, multi-platform infrastructure. Pearson VUE and Vodafone both chose our security stack to protect their digital estate across clouds. And we're going further to help protect organizations. Our new Entra product family includes tools for permissions management, identity governance and identity verification. And we now offer managed threat detection and response with Microsoft Security Experts, the world's largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, for example, will use the service to supplement its own security operations. Now on to LinkedIn. We once again saw record engagement among the more than 850 million members, a testament to how mission-critical the platform is to connect job seekers with jobs, learners with skills and marketeers with buyers. We are seeing job candidates and employers alike prioritize skills to more efficiently find and source work. More than 40% of the companies on LinkedIn now rely on skills filters to identify candidates. LinkedIn Talent Solutions surpassed $6 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, up 39% year-over-year. And LinkedIn Marketing Solutions surpassed $5 billion in annual revenue for the first time. We are a leader in B2B digital advertising, and we continue to see customers choose us for higher reach and ROI. More broadly, despite the current headwinds in the ad market, we are expanding our opportunity in advertising as we look towards the long term. We are creating a new monetization engine for the web, an alternative that offers marketeers and publishers more long-term viable ad solutions and supports consumer privacy and strong data governance. It starts with our first-party Internet experiences. We are focused on increasing our share and engagement across Edge, Bing and our personalized content feed, Microsoft Start. Daily content consumption across Start in categories like news, weather, finance and sports increased 80% since we launched the service 1 year ago. And Edge continues to gain share as consumers use it to save money with our built-in coupon and price comparison features. Our approach extends to our third-party ad network. We closed our acquisition of Xandr last month and now power one of the world's largest marketplaces for premium advertising. With Microsoft advertising, every media and consumer Internet company now has a trusted platform for their own ad innovation and monetization. Just 2 weeks ago, Netflix chose us as its exclusive technology and sales partner for its first ad-supported subscription offering, a validation of the differentiated value we provide to any publisher looking for a flexible partner willing to build and innovate with them. And with PromoteIQ, we are providing a platform for retailers like Home Depot, Kohl's and Kroger to build their own digital commerce and marketing channels. This quarter, Sephora chose our solution to help build a new advertising revenue stream while maintaining ownership of their own data and customer relationships. Now on to gaming. We offer the best value in the gaming industry. Our Xbox Game Pass subscription service includes access to hundreds of games, and Xbox Series S is the most affordable next-generation console. We sold more consoles live to date than any previous generation of Xbox and have been the market leader in North America for 3 quarters in a row amongst next-gen consoles. And with Xbox Cloud Gaming, we are bringing games to new endpoints. Players now can stream Xbox games on Samsung smart TVs. And we partnered with Epic Games to make Fortnite available for free via the browser. Over 4 million people have streamed the game to date, including over 1 million who were new to our ecosystem. In closing, we are investing in sharpening our focus to help our customers during this critical moment and to capture the massive technological shifts underway. Our portfolio of best-of-category products and best-of-suite solutions, along with our durable business models, an intense focus on prioritization and executional excellence, make me confident about our opportunity ahead in the coming year. With that, I'll hand it over to Amy.",2268.0,1231.0,45.0,12.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,9.0,3.0,1.0,0.036555645816409424,0.00974817221770918,0.002437043054427295,0.0,0.002437043054427295,0.026807473598700244
MSFT,2022-07-26,2022-07-27,,2022-07-26,2022-07-26T17:30:00-04:00,0,2022-07-26,qa,qna_heading,Amy Hood,"Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $51.9 billion, up 12% and 16% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.23 and increased 3% and 8% in constant currency. I'd like to start by discussing the impact of the macroeconomic environment on our results this quarter. First, FX. The U.S. dollar strengthened throughout the quarter, creating an additional headwind beyond what we shared mid-quarter. As a result, for the full quarter, revenue and EPS were negatively impacted by $595 million and $0.04 per share, beyond our expectations shared in April. Next, extended production setdowns in China that continued through May and a deteriorating PC market in June contributed to a negative Windows OEM revenue impact of more than $300 million. And finally, reductions in advertising spend impacted LinkedIn Marketing Solutions and search and news advertising revenue by more than $100 million. In our consumer business, despite those macro challenges, we drove another quarter of share gains for Windows in the PC market and for Edge in browsers. In our commercial business, Q4 was the largest quarter ever for long-term commitments to our platform. And as you heard from Satya, we saw share gains in areas such as data and AI, Dynamics, Teams and security. Against a strong prior year comparable, commercial bookings increased 25% and 35% in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations. Our record commitment quarter was driven by increases in the number of $100 million-plus Azure and $10 million-plus Microsoft 365 contracts as well as consistent strong execution across our core annuity sales motions. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 34% and 37% in constant currency to $189 billion. Roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 28% year-over-year. The remaining portion which will be recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 39% year-over-year, and our acuity mix increased 1 point year-over-year to 96%. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $25 billion and grew 28% and 33% in constant currency. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 69%. Excluding the impact from the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point, driven by improvement across our cloud services, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure. Now back to total company level. As noted earlier, FX decreased total company revenue by 4 points, 2 points unfavorable to expectations. Additionally, FX decreased COGS and operating expense growth by 2 points, 1 point favorable to expectations. Gross margin dollars increased 10% and 15% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased year-over-year to 68%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate and FX, gross margin percentage increased slightly as the improvement in cloud services noted earlier was partially offset by sales mix shift to cloud. Operating expense increased 14% and 16% in constant currency, driven by increased investments in cloud engineering, LinkedIn and Nuance. OpEx growth included roughly 2 points from the decision to scale down operations in Russia, employee severance and the impact from the Xandr acquisition, which closed in June. At a total company level, headcount grew 22% year-over-year as we continued to invest in key areas such as cloud engineering, LinkedIn, sales and customer deployment, and included roughly 6 points of growth from the Nuance and Xandr acquisitions. Operating income increased 8% and 14% in constant currency, and operating margins decreased year-over-year to 40%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate and FX, operating margins were relatively unchanged as the improvement in cloud services noted earlier and sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses were offset by the impact of the Nuance acquisition. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $16.6 billion and grew 13% and 17% in constant currency. FX decreased segment revenue $159 million more than expected. When adjusting for the additional FX headwind, overall segment results were in line with expectations. Office commercial revenue grew 9% and 13% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 15% and 19% in constant currency, in line with expectations, driven by installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments as well as higher ARPU from continued momentum in E5. Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 14% year-over-year, driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings, although growth was impacted by some moderation in new deal volume outside of E5, particularly in the small and medium business customer segment. Demand for security, compliance and voice value in Microsoft 365 drove strong E5 momentum again this quarter. E5 now accounts for 12% of our Office 365 commercial installed base. Office commercial licensing was down 32% and 28% in constant currency, lower than expected, driven primarily by a lower mix of contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition. Office consumer revenue grew 9% and 12% in constant currency, in line with expectations, driven by continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 15% to 59.7 million. Dynamics revenue grew 19% and 24% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 31% and 36% in constant currency, slightly below expectations due to lower-than-expected growth in new business even as our cloud growth continues to outpace the market. LinkedIn revenue increased 26% to 29% in constant currency, lower than expected as Marketing Solutions was impacted by the slowdown of advertising spend noted earlier. And Talent Solutions was impacted by weaker online job posts late in the quarter. Segment gross margin dollars increased 12% and 17% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point, driven by improvement across all cloud services. Operating expense increased 12% and 14% in constant currency, and operating income increased 12% and 19% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $20.9 billion, increasing 20% and 25% in constant currency. FX decreased segment revenue $309 million, more than expected. Excluding the additional FX headwind, segment results were in line with expectations. Overall, Server products and cloud services revenue increased 22% and 26% in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 40% and 46% in constant currency, about 1 point lower than expected, driven by a slight moderation in Azure consumption growth across customer segments. In our per user business, the Enterprise Mobility and Security installed base grew 21% to over 230 million seats, with some impact from the small and medium business deal moderation noted earlier. In our on-premises server business, revenue decreased 2% and increased 1% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by a greater-than-expected number of contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition. Enterprise Services revenue grew 5% and 8% in constant currency, lower than expected, driven by declines in Microsoft Consulting Services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 15% and 19% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 3 points year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage declined roughly 2 points, driven by sales mix shift to Azure, partially offset by improvements in Azure margins. Operating expenses increased 20% and 22% in constant currency, including roughly 7 points of impact from Nuance. And operating income grew 11% and 18% in constant currency. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $14.4 billion, increasing 2% and 5% in constant currency. FX decreased segment revenue $127 million more than expected. Excluding the additional FX headwind, segment results were below our guidance range, driven by the PC and ad trends mentioned earlier. Windows OEM revenue decreased 2% year-over-year. Despite the deteriorating PC market, we saw share gains again this quarter and volumes remained above pre-pandemic levels. Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 6% and 12% in constant currency, lower than expected due to some impact from the small and medium business deal moderation noted earlier. Surface revenue grew 10% and 15% in constant currency, driven by commercial sales. Search and news advertising revenue ex TAC increased 18% and 21% in constant currency, lower than expected, driven by the slowdown in advertising spend noted earlier, partially offset by the inclusion of 3 weeks of results from Xandr. And in gaming, revenue declined 7% and 5% in constant currency, in line with expectations. Xbox hardware revenue declined 11% and 8% in constant currency. Xbox content and services revenue declined 6% and 4% in constant currency, driven by lower engagement hours and monetization in third-party and first-party content, partially offset by growth in Xbox Game Pass subscriptions. Segment gross margin dollars were relatively unchanged and increased 4% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 1 point year-over-year, driven by increased usage of Windows Commercial Cloud services. Operating expenses increased 8% and 10% in constant currency, and operating income decreased 5% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $8.7 billion, in line with expectations. Cash paid for PP&E was $6.9 billion. Our data center investments continue to be based on significant customer demand and usage signals. Cash flow from operations was $24.6 billion, increasing 8%, driven by strong cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $17.8 billion, up 9% year-over-year. This quarter, other income and expense was negative $47 million, primarily driven by net losses on investments, including mark-to-market losses on our equity portfolio. Equity market declines drove net investment losses this quarter compared to net investment gains last year, resulting in a negative 3-point impact on EPS growth. Our effective tax rate was approximately 18%. And finally, we returned $12.4 billion to shareholders, up 19% year-over-year through share repurchases and dividends, bringing our total cash returned to shareholders to over $46 billion for the full fiscal year. Now moving to our outlook. My commentary for both the full year and next quarter does not include any impact from Activision, which we still expect to close by the end of the fiscal year. Let me start with some full year commentary for FY '23. First, effective at the start of FY '23, we are extending the depreciable useful life for server and network equipment assets in our cloud infrastructure from 4 to 6 years, which will apply to the asset balances on our balance sheet as of June 30, 2022, as well as future asset purchases. Investments in our software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment as well as advances in technology have resulted in lives extending beyond historical accounting useful lives. This change only impacts the timing of depreciation expense in the future for these assets. As a result, based on the outstanding balances as of June 30, we expect fiscal year '23 operating income to be favorably impacted by approximately $3.7 billion for the full fiscal year and approximately $1.1 billion in the first quarter. This has been included in the guidance we will provide on today's call. Additional details on the mechanics of the change are in our earnings materials. Second, on FX. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect a roughly 4-point impact to full year revenue growth with headwinds in H1 greater than in H2. FX should also decrease COGS and operating expense growth by 2 points. Now to our full year business outlook based on the current macro environment. At every level of the company, we manage performance on a constant currency basis, as we have for many years. Therefore, with the FX volatility we have seen, I will comment on full year in constant currency and in U.S. dollars. We continue to expect double-digit revenue and operating income growth in both constant currency and U.S. dollars. Revenue growth will be driven by continued momentum in our commercial business and a focus on share gains across our portfolio. Operating expense growth will be significant early in FY '23 and will moderate materially over the course of the year as we slow the rate of hiring to focus on key growth areas, increase the productivity of prior year headcount investments and anniversary the Nuance and Xandr acquisitions. And even with this significant level of investment in our future, we expect operating margins based on constant currency to be approximately flat year-over-year in FY '23, excluding the benefit from the latest change in useful life. And in U.S. dollars, we expect FY '23 full year margins to be roughly flat as the useful life benefit is mostly offset by the FX headwind mentioned earlier. And finally, we expect our FY '23 effective tax rate to be roughly 19%. Now to the outlook for the first quarter, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S. dollar basis. First, FX. With the stronger U.S. dollar and based on current rates, we expect FX to decrease total revenue growth by approximately 5 points and to decrease total COGS and operating expense growth by approximately 3 points. Within the segments, we anticipate roughly 6 points of negative FX impact on revenue growth in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud and 3 points in More Personal Computing. Overall, our outlook has the trends we saw in June continue through Q1. Continued weakness in the PC market demand and advertising spend will impact Windows OEM, Surface, LinkedIn and search and news advertising revenue. Our differentiated market position, customer demand across our solution portfolio and consistent execution across the Microsoft Cloud should drive another strong quarter of revenue and share growth, although we expect to continue to see growth moderation in our small- and medium-sized business segment. In commercial bookings, strong execution across our core annuity sales motions and increased commitment to our platform should drive healthy growth on a flat expiry base. As a reminder, the growing mix of larger long-term measure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, always drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be up roughly 2 points year-over-year, driven by the latest accounting estimate change noted earlier. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, Q1 gross margin percentage will decrease roughly 1 point, driven by revenue mix shift to Azure and the impact from the Nuance acquisition, partially offset by continued margin improvement in Azure. In capital expenditures, we expect a sequential decrease on a dollar basis, with normal quarterly spend variability and the timing of our cloud infrastructure build-out. Next is segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 12% and 14% in constant currency or US$15.95 billion to US$16.25 billion. In Office commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be sequentially lower by roughly 2 points on a constant currency basis with a bit more FX impact on U.S. dollar growth than at the segment level. In our on-premises business, on a prior year comparable, which benefited from contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition, we expect revenue to decline in the mid- to high 30s. In Office consumer, we expect revenue to grow in the low to mid-single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect continued strong engagement on the platform, although results will be impacted by the slowdown in advertising spend and hiring, resulting in low to mid-teens rev growth. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the mid- to high teens, driven by share growth in Dynamics 365. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 25% and 27% in constant currency or US$20.3 billion to US$20.6 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and from in-period revenue recognition, depending on the mix of contracts. We expect Azure revenue growth to be sequentially lower by roughly 3 points on a constant currency basis. Azure revenue will continue to be driven by strong growth in consumption, and our per-user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, although we expect moderation in growth rates, given the size of the installed base. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline low single digits, driven by strong demand for our hybrid offerings offset by the prior year comparable, which included benefit from contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition. At Enterprise Services, we expect revenue growth to be in the low single digits, driven by enterprise support, partially offset by declines in Microsoft Consulting Services. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to grow between 1% and 4% in constant currency or US$13 billion to US$13.4 billion. In Windows OEM, we expect revenue to decline in the high single digits. Excluding the impact from the Windows 11 revenue deferral last year, revenue would decline mid-teens, reflecting continued weakness in the PC market. In Windows commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive growth in the high single digits. In Surface, revenue should decline in the low single digits. Search and news advertising ex TAC should grow in the mid- to high teens, roughly 10 points faster than the overall search and news advertising revenue, driven by growing first-party revenue and the inclusion of Xandr. And in gaming, we expect revenue to decline in the low to mid-single digits, driven by declines in first-party content, partially offset by growth in Game Pass subscribers and consoles. We expect Xbox content and services revenue to decline in the low to mid-single digits. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS to grow between 12% and 14% in constant currency or to be between US$14.9 billion and US$15.1 billion and operating expense to grow between 19% and 20% in constant currency or to be between US$13.3 billion and US$13.4 billion. Total company headcount is expected to continue to grow, with 11,000 hires expected to start in Q1, primarily in cloud engineering, LinkedIn, customer deployment and commercial sales. In other income and expense, interest income and expense should offset each other. As a reminder, we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio, which can increase quarterly volatility. And we expect our Q1 effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. Finally, as a reminder on Q1 cash flow, we will be making $3.2 billion of tax payments related to the TCJA transition tax and the transfer of intangible property completed in Q1 of FY '22. In closing, we continue to see strong demand for our products and services and increased commitment to our platform as we remain focused on delivering compelling customer value in this dynamic environment, resulting in continued share gains. As we manage through this period, we will continue to invest in future growth while maintaining intense focus on operational excellence and execution discipline.

And that's where my question lies. You talked about the largest-ever number of big deals that you guys were able to sign in Q4. Typically, we think this type of environment is -- it makes it harder to sign those big deals. Can you talk to us a little bit about how you got that done? Was the consolidating impact that Microsoft brings to the market the price performance? And maybe the macro, is that actually a benefit for you guys to close these deals in this type of environment? Or was it just kind of a typical Q4 end-of-year kind of budget flush kind of thing for you guys?

So there's obviously something going on in the macro environment, which does feel that it does play to our strength. There are 2 things at least I've observed. One is the -- whether the bookings number or the Mac deals and the size of the Mac deals and the number of them, I think, speak to very much what we have been talking about for a long time now, which is as a percentage of GDP, IT spend is going to increase because every business is trying to fortify itself with digital tech to, in some sense, navigate this macro environment. So that, I think, is probably what is reflected in those numbers. And then the second aspect is also what you just referenced, which is, we do have every layer of the tech stack, right, whether it's infra, data, hybrid work, security, even Power Platform. In each one of these, we do have this best-of-suite value, which includes best-of-category products. And that is leading to share gains. So if you want to bet on a vendor on a long-term basis where you have that best-of-suite value and then you're able to sort of consume it on your terms, I think that, that's effectively what some of those numbers are indicative of.",241.0,99.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0707070707070707,0.010101010101010102,0.010101010101010102,0.0,0.0,0.06060606060606061

With all the concerns about macro and recession, everyone is trying to understand how cloud and for Microsoft's case, more specifically, IaaS, PaaS offerings and this slowdown in recession, how do you think about Azure's resiliency? How do you think about Azure's exposure to advertising business, consumer Internet and SMB if we do see a real recession?",80.0,33.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15151515151515152,0.030303030303030304,0.0,0.0,-0.15151515151515152

I mean, overall, we're not immune to what's happening in the macro broadly, right? To Keith's question and your question, Mark, I think I'd say I'd start there because whether it's on the demand side with consumers or SMBs, I think Amy in her remarks talked about some of that even in our results in the quarter. But what's happening with -- in Azure though, is in some sense, businesses trying to deal with the overall macroeconomic situation and doing -- trying to make sure that they can do more with less. So for example, moving to the cloud is the best way to shape your spend with demand uncertainty, right? Because -- and in fact, if anything, one of the things that we're seeing is an increased shift towards the cloud. And then, of course, optimizing your bill. We are incenting even our own field to ensure that the bills for our customers come down. And that, in fact, even shows up in some of the volatility in our Azure numbers because that's one of the big benefits of the public cloud. And that's why I think coming out of this macroeconomic crisis, the public cloud will be even a bigger winner because it does act as that deflationary force. So that's sort of what we are seeing in the Azure numbers. We will be exposed to consumer-driven businesses and SMBs. But at some level, our strength as a company is much stronger in the core commercial. So I think that we'll do fine there. The other one is also people building new applications at a completely new frontier. I mean, there are two numbers that I talked about. One is the triple-digit growth in Cosmos DB and triple-digit growth in container app services. You take those two things and you say, what are people doing? People are writing applications at a completely different frontier of efficiency, which is cloud-native serverless container-based types of applications. And so to me, that's another way for you to make sure that your IT spend goes a long way in a time like this.",377.0,167.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.029940119760479042,0.029940119760479042,0.017964071856287425,0.0,0.0,0.0

And as I said, I took what we saw in June, applied it as best we thought we could through the course of the fiscal year. And if you think about how the -- and if you try to look over the course of the year with some of my comments, you'd say, okay, in H1 versus H2, I would point out 3 things that changed a bit over the course of that time. First, of course, if we're talking about USD would be FX, it's a bigger headwind in H1, it's less of a headwind in H2. The second thing I would point to would be OpEx. As we've talked about in H1, we've obviously added 22% headcount this quarter. We still have 11,000 hires that we have starting in Q1. We've still got Nuance and Xandr in acquisitions, and we anniversary a lot of that as we focus our hiring and focus on the productivity of all of the hiring we've done over the past year. And then the OEM comparables obviously get a lot different when you get from H1 into H2.

I would point you, Karl, really to some of the things Satya mentioned, which is, and we said in our comments, we did see some deceleration, a point a little more than we had expected in the consumption side through the course of Q4. It really applied across all customer segments and, in general, applied across geographies. You saw customers, as Satya discussed, much like they always do, focus on optimization and continuing to think about which new workflows to prioritize and start. We've really taken that frame and applied it as we thought to H1 and specifically to Q1 in that guidance. It does assume continued consumption deceleration of 3 points quarter-to-quarter. I still feel very good about the patterns we're seeing. I feel good about the workloads that Satya mentioned and where we feel like we can take some share. But at the same time, we really are focused on taking the agreements that we signed in Q4, making sure we're working with the customers on deployment, projects that have quick time to value, investing to make sure they're starting the projects that can save them money, that can help them innovate.

Obviously, the big driver of our growth this quarter was in data center spend, both new and newbuilds as well as adding capacity to existing data centers.

I did allude to it a couple of times when discussing Office EMS or the Azure per-user service as well as Windows commercial. And of course, that is because it's all related to selling Microsoft 365. And we did see, as I noted, some weakness in new deals, particularly in the SMB segment outside of E5. So to your point, think of them as SKUs are really intended, right, for that type of audience and customer base. And it came from a couple of things, Kirk, one of which we talked about before is that we are -- that is primarily sold through partner. And so we need to make sure we've got the best value props. We've got to make sure the price is right, offers right and make sure that we are tuning that value prop to what small business customers need today, which is great value, and so we'll keep executing that through partner. We're in the middle of that transition we talked about last quarter, and we're still working on it. The second thing is I would also say that is a spot where you tend to see macro weakness show itself, and we alluded to that as well in my comment because while I can't tell you, in particular, which part of that is some of the partner transition work we're doing versus macro, it certainly feels like both. And so that's certainly a spot that we're watching. I think your point around making sure we've got the right feed, which is absolutely do more with less and that we can help both modernize and get great value through the suites. But it's an important caveat to that. And you saw the way it shows itself, as you might notice is you saw the seat growth be a little lighter than you would have expected in the quarter.

I do think it speaks to what Satya and I have said, which is we see customers continuing to optimize, whether that's -- whether it's through reserved instance, whether it's through existing workloads and purchase patterns.

And it implies that these Azure commitments that we signed through the course of the year, because it takes time for it to convert those large contracts until actual consumption and new project growth, as that work gets completed both at the customer and with our help, you'll start to see new projects add as the plus to the optimization that occurs.

To start, I want to outline the principles that are guiding us through these changing economic times. First, we will invest behind categories that will drive the long-term secular trend where digital technology as a percentage of world's GDP will continue to increase. Second, we'll prioritize helping our customers get the most value out of their digital spend, so that they can do more with less. And finally, we will be disciplined in managing our cost structure. With that context, this quarter, the Microsoft Cloud again exceeded $25 billion in quarterly revenue, up 24% and 31% in constant currency. And based on current trends continuing, we expect our broader commercial business to grow at around 20% in constant currency this fiscal year, as we manage through the cyclical trends affecting our consumer business. With that, let me highlight our progress starting with Azure. Moving to the cloud is the best way for organizations to do more with less today. It helps them align their spend with demand and mitigate risk around increasing energy costs and supply chain constraints. We're also seeing more customers turn to us to build and innovate with infrastructure they already have. With Azure Arc, organizations like Wells Fargo can run Azure services, including containerized applications across on-premises, edge and multi-cloud environments. We now have more than 8,500 Arc customers, more than double the number a year ago. We are the platform of choice for customers' SAP workloads in the cloud, companies like [Chobani] (ph), Munich Re, Sodexo, Volvo Cars, all run SAP on Azure. We are the only cloud provider with direct and secure access to Oracle databases running an Oracle Cloud infrastructure, making it possible for companies like FedEx, GE and Marriott to use capabilities from both companies. And with Azure Confidential Computing, we're enabling companies in highly regulated industries, including RBC, to bring their most sensitive applications to the cloud. Just last week, UBS said it will move more than 50% of its applications to Azure. Now to data and AI. With our Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform, we provide a complete data fabric, helping customers cut integration tax associated with bringing together siloed solutions. Customers like Mercedes-Benz are standardizing on our data stack to process and govern massive amounts of data. Cosmos DB is the go-to database powering the world's most demanding workloads at limitless scale. Cosmos DB now supports postscript SQL, making Azure the first cloud provider to offer a database service that supports both relational and no SQL workloads. And in AI, we are turning the world's most advanced models into platforms for customers. Earlier this month, we brought the power of DALL-E to Azure OpenAI service, helping customers like Mattel apply the breakthrough image generation model to commercial use cases for the first time. In Azure machine learning, provides industry-leading ML apps, helping organizations like 3M deploy, manage and govern models. All up, Azure ML revenue has increased more than 100% for four quarters in a row. Now on to developers. We have the most complete platform for developers to build cloud native applications. Four years since our acquisition, GitHub is now at $1 billion in annual recurring revenue. And GitHub's developer first ethos has never been stronger. More than 90 million people now use the service to build software for any cloud on any platform up three times. GitHub advanced security is helping organizations improve their security posture by bringing features directly into the developer's workflow. Toyota North America chose the offering this quarter to help its developers build and secure many of its most critical applications. Now on to Power Platform. We are helping customers save time and money with our end-to-end suite spanning Low-Code/No-Code tools, robotic process automation, virtual agents and business intelligence. Power BI is the market leader in business intelligence in the cloud and is growing faster than competition, as companies like Walmart standardize on the tool for reporting and analytics. Power Apps is the market leader in Low-Code/No-Code tools and has nearly 15 million monthly active users, up more than 50% compared to a year ago. Power Automate has more than seven million monthly active users and is being used by companies like Brown-Forman, Komatsu, Mass, T-Mobile to digitize manual business processes and save thousands of hours of employee time. And we're going further with new AI-powered capabilities and power automate that turn natural language into advanced workflows. Now on to Dynamics 365. From customer experience and service to finance and supply chain, we continue to take share across all categories we serve. For example, Lufthansa Cargo chose us to centralize customer information and related shipments. CBRE is optimizing its field service operations, gaining cost efficiencies. Darden is using our solutions to increase both guest frequency and spend at its restaurants. And Tillamook is scaling its growth and improving supply chain visibility. All up more than 400,000 organizations now use our business applications. Now on to Industry Solutions. We are seeing increased adoption of our industry and cross-industry clouds. Bank of Queensland chose our cloud for financial services to deliver new digital experiences for its customers. Our cloud for sustainability is off to a fast start as organizations like Telstra use the solution to track their environmental footprint. New updates provide insights on hard-to-measure Scope 3 carbon emissions, and we are seeing record growth in healthcare, driven, in part, by our Nuance DAX ambient intelligence solutions, which automatically documents patient encounters at the point of care. Physicians tell us DAX dramatically improves their productivity, and it's quickly becoming an on-ramp to our broader healthcare offerings. Now on to new systems of work, Microsoft 365, Teams and Viva uniquely enable employees to thrive in today's digitally connected distributed world of work. Microsoft 365 is the cloud-first platform that supports all the ways people work and every type of worker reducing cost and complexity for IT. The new Microsoft 365 app brings together our productivity apps with third-party content, as well as personalized recommendations. Microsoft Teams is the de facto standard for collaboration and has become essential to how hundreds of millions of people meet, call, chat, collaborate and do business. As we emerge from the pandemic, we are retaining users we have gained and are seeing increased engagement, too. Users interact with Teams 1,500 times per month on average. In a typical day, the average commercial user spends more time in Teams chat than they do in e-mail, and the number of users who use four or more features within Teams increased over 20% year-over-year. Teams is becoming a ubiquitous platform for business process. Monthly active enterprise users running third-party and custom applications within Teams increased nearly 60% year-over-year, and over 55% of our enterprise customers who use Teams today also buy Teams Rooms or Teams Phone. Teams Phone provides the best-in-class calling. PSTN users have grown by double digits for five quarters in a row. We are bringing Teams Rooms to a growing hardware ecosystem, including Cisco's devices and peripherals, which will now run Teams natively. And we are creating a new category with Microsoft Places to help organizations evolve and manage the space for hybrid and in-person work. Just like Outlook calendar orchestrates when people can meet and collaborate, Places will do the same for where. We also announced Teams Premium, addressing enterprise demands for advanced meeting features like additional security options and intelligent meeting recaps. All this innovation is driving growth across Microsoft 365. Leaders in every industry from Fannie Mae and Land O'Lakes to Rabobank continue to turn to our premium E5 offerings for advanced security, compliance, voice and analytics. We've also built a completely new suite for our employee experience platform, Microsoft Viva, which now has more than 20 million monthly active users at companies like Finastra, SES and Unilever. And we are extending Viva to meet role-specific needs. Viva Sales is helping salespeople at companies like Adobe, Crayon and PwC reclaim their time by bringing customer interactions across Teams and Outlook directly into their CRM system. Now on to Windows. Despite the drop in PC shipments during the quarter, Windows continues to see usage growth. All up, there are nearly 20% more monthly active Windows devices than pre-pandemic. And on average, Windows 10 and Windows 11 users are spending 8.5% more time on their PCs than they were 2.5 years ago. And we are seeing larger commercial deployments of Windows 11. Accenture, for example, has deployed Windows 11 to more than 450,000 employees' PCs, up from just 25,000, 7 months ago, and L'Oreal has deployed the operating system to 85,000 employees. Now to security. Security continues to be a top priority for every organization. We're the only company with integrated end-to-end tools spanning security, compliance, identity and device management and privacy across all clouds and platforms. More than 860,000 organizations across every industry from BP and Fuji Film to ING Bank, iHeartMedia and Lumen Technologies now use our security solutions, up 33% year-over-year. They can save up to 60% when they consolidate our security stack, and the number of customers with more than four workloads have increased 50% year-over-year. More organizations are choosing both our XDR and cloud-native SIM to secure their entire digital estate. The number of E5 customers who also purchased Sentinel increased 44% year-over-year. And as threats become more sophisticated, we are innovating to protect customers. New capabilities in Defender help secure the entire DevOps life cycle and manage security posture across clouds. And Entra now provides comprehensive identity governance for both on-premise and cloud-based user directories. Now on to LinkedIn. We once again saw record engagement among our more than 875 million members, with international growth increasing at nearly 2x the pace as in the United States. There are now more than 150 million subscriptions to newsletters on LinkedIn, up 4x year-over-year. New integrations between Viva and LinkedIn Learning helped companies invest in their existing employees by providing access to courses directly in the flow of work. Members added 365 million skills to their profiles over the last 12 months, up 43% year-over-year. And with our acquisition of EduBrite, they will also soon be able to earn professional certificates from trusted partners directly on the platform. We launched the next-generation sales navigator this quarter, helping sellers increase win rates and deal sizes by better understanding and evaluating customer interest. Finally, LinkedIn Marketing Solution continues to provide leading innovation and ROI in B2B digital advertising. More broadly, with Microsoft Advertising, we offer a trusted platform for any marketeer or advertiser looking to innovate. We've expanded our geographies we serve by nearly 4x over the past year. We are seeing record daily usage of Edge, Start and Bing driven by Windows. Edge is the fastest-growing browser on Windows and continues to gain share as people use built-in coupon price comparison features to save money. We surface more than $2 billion in savings to date. And this quarter, we brought our shopping tools to 15 new markets. Users of our Start, personalized content feed are consuming 2x more content compared to a year ago. And we're also expanding our third-party ad inventory. Netflix will launch its first ad-supported subscription plan next month, exclusively powered by our technology and sales. And with PromoteIQ we offer an omni-channel media platform for retailers like the auto group looking to generate additional revenue while maintaining ownership of their own data and customer relationships. Now onto gaming. We are adding new gamers to our ecosystem as we execute on our ambition to reach players wherever and whenever they want on any device. We saw usage growth across all platforms driven by the strength of console. PC Game Pass subscriptions increased 159% year-over-year. And with cloud gaming, we're transforming how games are distributed, played and viewed. More than 20 million people have used the service to stream games to date. And we are adding support for new devices like handhelds from Logitech and Razor as well as Meta Quest. And as we look towards the holidays, we offer the best value in gaming with Game Pass and Xbox Series S, nearly half of the Series S buyers are new to our ecosystem. In closing, in a world facing increasing headwinds, digital technology is the ultimate tailwind. And we're innovating across the entire tech stack to help every organization, while also focusing intensely on our operational excellence and execution discipline. With that, I'll hand it over to Amy.",2107.0,1171.0,33.0,2.0,8.0,2.0,1.0,13.0,7.0,1.0,0.028181041844577284,0.0017079419299743809,0.006831767719897523,0.0017079419299743809,0.0008539709649871904,0.026473099914602904
MSFT,2022-10-25,2022-10-26,,2022-10-25,2022-10-25T18:30:00-04:00,0,2022-10-25,qa,qna_heading,Amy Hood,"Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter revenue was $50.1 billion, up 11% and 16% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.35, increased 4% and 11% in constant currency when adjusted for the net tax benefit for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. Driven by strong execution in a dynamic environment, we delivered a solid start to our fiscal year, in line with our expectations even as we saw many of the macro trends from the end of the fourth quarter continued to weaken through Q1. In our consumer business, PC market demand further deteriorated in September, which impacted our Windows OEM and Surface businesses. And reductions in customer advertising spend, which also weakened later in the quarter, impacted search and news advertising and LinkedIn Marketing Solutions. As you heard from Satya, in our commercial business, we saw strong overall demand for our Microsoft cloud offerings with a growth of 31% in constant currency as well as share gains across many businesses. Commercial bookings declined 3% and increased 16% in constant currency on a flat expiry base. Excluding the FX impact, growth was driven by strong renewal execution, and we continue to see growth in the number of large long-term Azure and Microsoft 365 contracts across all deal sizes. More than half of the $10 million plus Microsoft 365 bookings came from E5. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 31% and 34% in constant currency to $180 billion. Roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 23% year-over-year. The remaining portion, which we recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 38% year-over-year, and our annuity mix increased one point year-over-year to 96%. FX impacted company results in line with expectations. With the stronger US dollar, FX decreased total company revenue by five points, and at the segment level, FX decreased productivity and business processes and intelligent cloud revenue growth by six points and more personal computing revenue growth by three points. Additionally, FX decreased COGS and operating expense growth by three points. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased roughly two points year-over-year to 73%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, Microsoft cloud gross margin percentage decreased roughly one point driven by sales mix shift to Azure and lower Azure margin, primarily due to higher energy costs. Company gross margin dollars increased 9% and 16% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 69%, excluding the impact of the latest change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased roughly 3 points, driven by sales mix shift to cloud, the lower Azure margin noted earlier and Nuance. Operating expense increased 15% and 18% in constant currency, driven by investments in cloud engineering, LinkedIn, Nuance and commercial sales. At a total company level, headcount grew 22% year-over-year, as we continue to invest in key areas just mentioned, as well as customer deployment. Headcount growth included roughly 6 points from the Nuance and Xandr acquisitions, which closed last Q3 and Q4, respectively. Operating income increased 6% and 15% in constant currency, and operating margins decreased roughly 2 points year-over-year to 43%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins declined roughly 4 points year-over-year driven by sales mix shift to cloud, unfavorable FX impact, Nuance and the lower Azure margin noted earlier. Now to our segment results. Revenue from productivity and business processes was $16.5 billion and grew 9% and 15% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, with better-than-expected results in Office commercial and LinkedIn. Office commercial revenue grew 7% and 13% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 11% and 17% in constant currency, slightly better than expected, with the strong renewal execution noted earlier. Growth was driven by installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments, as well as higher ARPU from E5. Demand for security, compliance and voice value in Microsoft 365 drove strong E5 momentum again this quarter. Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 14% year-over-year, driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings, although we saw a continued impact of new deal moderation outside of E5. Office consumer revenue grew 7% and 11% in constant currency, driven by continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 13% to $61.3 million. Dynamics revenue grew 15% and 22% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 24% and 32% in constant currency. LinkedIn revenue increased 17% and 21% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected growth in Talent Solutions, partially offset by weakness in marketing solutions from the advertising trends noted earlier. Segment gross margin dollars increased 11% and 18% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the latest change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased slightly, driven by sales mix shift to cloud offerings. Operating expense increased 13% and 16% in constant currency, and operating income increased 10% and 19% in constant currency, including 4 points due to the latest change in accounting estimate. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $20.3 billion, increasing 20% and 26% in constant currency, in line with expectations. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue increased 22% and 28% in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 35% and 42% in constant currency, about 1 point lower than expected, driven by the continued moderation in Azure consumption growth, as we help customers optimize current workloads while they prioritize new workloads. In our per user business, the enterprise mobility and security installed base grew 18% to over 232 million seats, with continued impact from the new deal moderation noted earlier. In our on-premises server business, revenue was flat, and increased 4% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations, driven by hybrid demand, including better-than-expected annuity purchasing ahead of the SQL Server 2022 launch. Enterprise Services revenue grew 5% and 10% in constant currency, driven by enterprise support services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 20% and 26% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased slightly. Excluding the impact of the latest change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage declined roughly three points, driven by sales mix shift to Azure and higher energy costs impacting Azure margins. Operating expenses increased 25% and 28% in constant currency, including roughly eight points of impact from Nuance. And operating income grew 17% and 25% in constant currency with roughly nine points of favorable impact from the latest change in accounting estimate. Now to more Personal Computing. Revenue decreased slightly year-over-year to $13.3 billion and grew 3% in constant currency, in line with expectations overall, but with OEM and Surface weakness offset by upside in gaming consoles. Windows OEM revenue decreased 15% year-over-year. Excluding the impact from the Windows 11 deferral last year, revenue declined 20%, driven by PC market demand deterioration noted earlier. Devices revenue grew 2% and 8% in constant currency, in line with expectations, driven by the impact of a large Hollands deal, partially offset by low double-digit declines in consumer Surface sales. Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 8% and 15% in constant currency, in line with expectations, driven by demand for Microsoft 365 E5 noted earlier. Search and news advertising revenue, ex TAC, increased 16% and 21% in constant currency, in line with expectations, benefiting from an increase in search volumes and roughly five points of impact from Xandr even as we saw increased ad market headwinds during September. Edge browser gained share again this quarter. And in gaming, revenue grew slightly and was up 4% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected console sales. Xbox hardware revenue grew 13% and 19% in constant currency. Xbox content and services revenue declined 3% and increased 1% in constant currency, driven by declines in first-party content as well as in third-party content where we had lower engagement hours and higher monetization, partially offset by growth in Xbox Game Pass subscriptions. Segment gross margin dollars declined 9% and 4% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased roughly five points year-over-year driven by sales mix shift to lower margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 2% and 5% in constant currency, driven by the Xandr acquisition. And operating income decreased 15% and 9% in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases were $6.6 billion, and cash paid for PP&E was $6.3 billion. Our data center investments continue to be based on strong customer demand and usage signals. Cash flow from operations was $23.2 billion, down 5% year-over-year, driven by strong cloud billings and collections, which were more than offset by a tax payment related to the transfer of intangible property completed in Q1 of FY '22. Free cash flow was $16.9 billion, down 10% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of this tax payment, cash flow from operations grew 2%, and free cash flow was relatively unchanged [indiscernible] year. This quarter, other income and expense was $54 million, driven by interest income, which was mostly offset by interest expense and net losses on foreign currency remeasurement. Our effective tax rate was approximately 19%. And finally, we returned $9.7 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Now, moving to our Q2 outlook, which, unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a US dollar basis. My commentary, for both the full year and next quarter, does not include any impact from AC [ph] division, which we still expect to close by the end of the fiscal year. First, FX. With the stronger US dollar and based on current rates, we now expect FX to decrease total revenue growth by approximately five points and to decrease total COGS and operating expense growth by approximately three points. Within the segments, we anticipate roughly seven points of negative FX impact on revenue growth in Productivity and Business Processes, six points in Intelligent Cloud and three points in more Personal Computing. Our outlook has many of the trends we saw at the end of Q1, continue into Q2. In our consumer business, materially weaker PC demand from September will continue, and impact both Windows OEM and Surface device results even as the Windows installed base and usage grows, as you heard from Satya. Additionally, customers focusing our advertising spend will impact LinkedIn and Search and News advertising revenue. In our commercial business, demand for our differentiated hybrid and cloud offerings, together with consistent execution, should drive healthy growth across the Microsoft Cloud. In commercial bookings, continued strong execution across core annuity sales motions and commitments to our platform should drive solid growth on a moderately growing expiry base against a strong prior year comparable, which included a significant volume of large long-term Azure contracts. As a reminder, the growing mix of larger long-term Azure contracts which are more unpredictable in their timing, always drives increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be up roughly one point year-over-year, driven by the latest accounting estimate change noted earlier. Excluding that impact, Q2 gross margin percentage will decrease roughly two points driven by lower Azure margin, primarily due to higher energy cost, revenue mix shift to Azure and the impact from Nuance. In capital expenditures, we expect a sequential increase on a dollar basis with normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure build-out. Next, to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 11% and 13% in constant currency or USD16.6 billion to USD 16.9 billion. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365, with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth from E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be similar to last quarter on a constant currency basis. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the low to mid-30s. In Office Consumer, we expect revenue to decline low to mid-single digits as Microsoft 365 subscription growth will be more than offset by unfavorable FX impact. For LinkedIn, we expect continued strong engagement on the platform, although results will be impacted by a slowdown in advertising spend and hiring, resulting in mid to high single-digit revenue growth or low to mid-teens growth in constant currency. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the low double digits or the low 20s in constant currency, driven by continued share gains in Dynamics 365. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 22% and 24% in constant currency or US$ 21.25 billion to US$ 21.55 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and from in-period recognition depending on the mix of contracts. We expect Azure revenue growth to be sequentially lower by roughly 5 points on a constant currency basis. Azure revenue will continue to be driven by strong growth in consumption, with some impact from the Q1 trends noted earlier. And our per user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect moderation in growth rate given the size of the installed base. In our on-premise server business, we expect revenue to decline low single digits, as demand for our hybrid solutions, including strong annuity purchasing from the SQL Server 2022 launch, will be more than offset by unfavorable FX impact. And in Enterprise Services, we expect revenue growth to be in the low single digits, driven by enterprise support. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue of US$ 14.5 billion to US$ 14.9 billion. In Windows OEM, we expect revenue to decline in the high 30s. Excluding the impact from the Windows 11 revenue deferral last year, revenue would decline mid-30s, reflecting both PC market demand and a strong prior year comparable, particularly in the commercial segment. In Devices, revenue should decline approximately 30%, again, roughly in line with the PC market. In Windows commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive growth in the mid-single digits or low double digits in constant currency. Search and news advertising, ex TAC, should grow in the low to mid-teens, roughly 6 points faster than overall search and news advertising revenue, driven by growing first-party revenue and the inclusion of Xandr. And in gaming, we expect revenue to decline in the low to mid-teens against a strong prior year comparable. That included several first-party title launches, partially offset by growth in Xbox Game Pass subscribers. We expect Xbox content and services revenue to decline in the low to mid-teens. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS to grow between 6% and 7% in constant currency or to be between US$ 17.4 billion and US$ 17.6 billion, and operating expense to grow between 17% and 18% in constant currency, or to be between US$ 14.3 billion and US$ 14.4 billion. As we continue to focus our investment in key growth areas, total headcount growth sequentially should be minimal. Other income and expense should be roughly $100 million, as interest income is expected to more than offset interest expense. Further FX and equity movements through Q2 are not reflected in this number. And as a reminder, we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio, which can increase quarterly volatility. And we expect our Q2 effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. And finally, as a reminder, for Q2 cash flow, we expect to make a $2.4 billion cash tax payment related to the capitalization of R&D provision enacted in 2017 TCJA and effective as of July 1, 2022. Now some thoughts on the full fiscal year. First, FX. Based on current rates, we now expect a roughly five-point headwind to full year revenue growth. And FX should decrease COGS and operating expense growth by approximately three points. At the total company level, we continue to expect double-digit revenue and operating income growth on a constant currency basis. Revenue will be driven by around 20% constant currency growth in our commercial business, driven by strong demand for our Microsoft cloud offerings. That growth will be partially offset by the increased declines we now see in the PC market. With the high margins in our Windows OEM business and the cyclical nature of the PC market, we take a long-term approach to investing in our core strategic growth areas and maintain these investment levels regardless of PC market conditions. Therefore, with our first quarter results and lower expected OEM revenue for the remainder of the year as well as over $800 million of greater than expected energy cost, we now expect operating margins in US dollars to be down roughly a point year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, excluding the incremental impact of the lower Windows OEM revenue and the favorable impact of the latest accounting change, we continue to expect FY 2023 operating margins to be roughly flat year-over-year. In closing, in this environment, it is more critical than ever to continue to invest in our strategic growth markets such as Cloud, Security, Teams, Dynamics 365 and LinkedIn where we have opportunities to continue to gain share as we provide problem solving innovations to our customers. And while we continue to help our customers do more with less, we will do the same internally. And you should expect to see our operating expense growth moderate materially through the year. While we focus on growing productivity of the significant headcount investments we've made over the last year. With that, let's go to Q&A.

Thank you guys for taking the question, and impressive results in what's obviously a very difficult environment. A question for Amy, and it pains me to ask a question about a percentage point. But I think this is what's on a lot of investors' minds. This is two quarters in a row now where Azure constant currency growth came in a little bit below your guidance. I think what investors are worrying about or sort of wondering about is the -- is there an inherent volatility in that business that's just harder to forecast? And on a go-forward basis, how should we think about that forecast? Have you applied more conservatism in it? And how should we think about Azure growth like the glide path for the whole year?

And I do appreciate you asking about that one point, because I do know it is a point of focus every quarter. And what I would say is there is some inherent volatility to that number. A point here or there, you've heard me say it, we've been a point better, and you've heard me say it when we've been a point worse. And I want to focus mostly on what, and how we see the number, which is that it is still a very large growth rate with growth across all segments and with growth across all geos. That was, to the question, generally in line with where we expected. And what we did see through the quarter is a real focus, both by customers, but also by our sales and customer success teams on going proactively to customers and making sure we are helping them optimize their workloads. And as we went through the quarter and as, of course, the macroeconomic environment got more complicated we continued to focus on that, because ultimately, those optimizations bring value even as budgets are still growing and budgeted spend is still growing. And so it's this nuance of you're still seeing digitization. This is still the tailwind that helps customers solve problems. This is still the way to build growth and leverage in your business, and yet you still want to optimize your workloads, you still want to run them the most efficiently so that you can then make room for new workload growth. We saw that across all segments. If there was one segment, well, I may have seen it a bit more, I would say, in the small or midsized segment of the market that tends to be more through partner. We rely on partners to help customers do those same optimizations and prepare workloads. But it is that one point. I know that, people are focused on. But if you step back and say, this is how you drive ultimate share gains and build customer loyalty and help customers grow, I think that needs to be the focus of our teams inside the company and also the partners that we rely on to help customers do that as well. And so as I look forward, there is some inherent volatility to this number. And here, I think you will hear us talk about continuing to invest to make that happen, whether it's in customer success, whether it's in optimizations, whether it's frankly an engineering to help people be able to even have better solutions to optimize against. I do think that will remain top of mind for us even as this remains probably the most exciting opportunity in TAM across infra, data and AI that exist in technology.

I mean, I think that's the only thing I would add, Amy, to your point is that obviously, our investment profile here is that this is the largest TAM where we, on a large number, have good growth rates with the kind of volatility you're seeing. So we're going to stay focused on it.

Let me go ahead and reiterate part of that, which is that this quarter, as you saw, we did have very good bookings growth. And within the RPO number that you're referring to, we had what we would call long-dated growth, which means we're having and seeing customers continue to sign commitments to the platform, and that goes really to what Satya mentioned is that the plans to invest here remain intact. And so it's about both the optimization that you're talking about, and we are seeing and the guide includes that, and it also includes new workload starting. And those also may not be matched up one-to-one to see sort of a consistent pattern. And that does result in some volatility. The other piece of it, Mark that we didn't talk on before because I was really focused on consumption is that there is per user headwinds as well, right, because we're getting and seeing some of these [loss] (ph) of large numbers in terms of the per seat business. So there's a couple of things going on here Mark again, as you said, a very large base. So it's not just the optimization to new workloads.

I think that's a place where we can talk specifically about the SMB market because we did see continued impact there in Q1, although it was not different than what we saw, frankly, in Q4. In Microsoft 365, what you saw was very good renewal execution. And it speaks to, I think, the value people are seeing in Microsoft 365. We had on-time renewals that were frankly better in Q1 based on expirations than we've seen a year ago. So deals are both getting done and I think getting done on time. They're getting done within a discount range that we feel good about. That's consistent. And we saw a good upsell to E5. So if you think about that as sort of forming the basis of what are we seeing above SMB, that's a good summary. Where we, in fact, saw -- I think we've talked about it, new deal moderation, and I referred to that, frankly, in Q4 as well -- it tended to be in, to your point, the smaller end of the market, small to midsized companies. And it also tended to be through partner, which we had talked about before, Brent a little bit, and I referred to. And it tended to be around selling what is, in fact, some new value that we put into E3. So this is a place where there is some macro impact, but there's also, I think, a better job we can do in our E3 SKU, which is really a core value proposition. We added a lot of value to that SKU in Q4 in terms of security and auto [packaging] (ph) for Windows. It's a great value in the same way E5 is. We landed E5 really well. We've got some work to do on landing E3. So there is some macro, seems pretty consistent, frankly, more than inconsistent with what we saw.

Satya, this quarter, we're seeing an inflection in many of your AI breakthroughs, thinking of GitHub Copilot and the image generation in your designer product. What is it that's enabling you to innovate so rapidly and essentially to be first to market? I'm wondering if it’s the OpenAI relationship or maybe some of your inferencing capabilities or something else? And then as a quick follow-up, Amy, you did mention the lower margins in Azure due to the higher energy costs. Are you inferring that we can kind of dimensionalize that incremental impact at something like $200 million per quarter?

Perhaps, it's sort of important to call out that we built the supercomputing capability inside of Azure, which is highly differentiated, the way computing the network, in particular, come together in order to support these large-scale training of these platform models or foundation models has been very critical. That's what's driven, in fact, the progress OpenAI has been making. And of course, we then productized it as part of Azure OpenAI services. And that's what you're seeing both being used by our own first-party applications, whether it's the GitHub Copilot or Design even inside match. And then, of course, the third parties like Mattel. And so, we're very excited about that. We have a lot sort of more sort of talk about when it comes to GitHub universe. I think you'll see more advances on the GitHub Copilot, which is off to a fantastic start. But overall, this is an area of huge investment. The AI comment clearly has arrived. And it's going to be part of every product, whether it's, in fact, you mentioned Power Platform, because that's another area we are innovating in terms of corporate all of these AI models. So, yes, so I think AI is a place where I think we have differentiated capability at an infrastructure layer for training and inference and the model that sells or platforms for third parties and our first-party applications are getting better because of the use of those AI models.",272.0,117.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.05128205128205128,0.008547008547008548,0.008547008547008548,0.0,0.0,0.042735042735042736

Clearly, you're experiencing a little bit more sales mix given the weakness on the Windows side.

And I shared a little bit on the call, but let me share a little more, because I think it's important in terms of how we think about investment and continuing to invest where we're seeing substantial opportunity and growth. The PC market is cyclical. And we had some great benefits for a couple of years during the pandemic, and we chose not to spend against that favorability over the past couple of years, and it fell to the bottom line, and you saw substantially increased margins over that time period. And we did that potentially because it is a cyclical market. And so in the same way I see it now is that PCs are going to be a tough headwind for us for the year. But overall, the Windows back to the installed base, our ability to grow usage, it's still higher than it was. And that's a good opportunity for us. And so in the same way that we let it fall to the bottom line when we saw a surge, it's important to stay consistent in this down market because when you have type of opportunity that we have specifically in the commercial business and the TAMs that Satya talked about has been some of our most exciting. And you have the opportunity with your customers to gain share, to gain confidence, right? And I think it's important to have a steady hand. Now, let me also say it is not as though we are not responding to the macro environment around cost. As I commented, our sequential headcount growth from Q1 to Q2 will be minimal. It will be about investing where we said we would invest, which is in focused areas. It's about moving headcount to make sure inside the company, we've got it on the highest and most important things. We've added a lot of headcount over the past 12 months. And we want to make sure we use those head count in the most productive way possible, and we're going to do that. And also, we're going to, frankly, lap some investments that we've made at the end of H2, Karl. We closed Nuance at the end of Q3. We closed Xandr in Q4. When we come and lap those, you will see a material decline in OpEx investment. You will also see us start to lap some of the headcount surges that we made last year in key areas. And by then, I feel good that we'll see productivity improvements from the headcount have and our focus. And so it's an ability to say, absolutely, I want to stay consistent, and we'll respond to the macro. It's possible to do both those things, and I think that's what we're doing.",478.0,195.0,11.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,0.05641025641025641,0.010256410256410256,0.010256410256410256,0.0,0.0,0.046153846153846156

A lot of the growth here is driven by subscriber growth. This quarter, for example, 17% constant currency, subscriber growth of 14%. Could you remind us where the incremental subscribers coming from? Could we see that mix of growth shift away from subscribers towards ASP potentially over time? I think you're already over 300 million subscribers. So just any color on just the runway from? Where is the increment C coming from and with all the works that you're doing with E3, E5 and collaboration security analytics, might we see more of the growth coming from ASP versus subscriber growth over time?

It's a good question because you've continued to see the seat growth, I think, for actually much longer than many of the investors had expected. And it really should continue in some ways because we're focusing on frontline worker scenarios, we're continuing to focus on small size business growth, and we're adding new things to which you can grow, whether that's Viva, whether it's Teams. There's new things that enable us to add relevancy, frankly, and then to add value and then to add seats. And so I don't want to say it has to be, again, this vision of or. So I think you'll continue to see lower end seat growth, which is what we've been seeing. And you will see us continue to focus on the value of E5 and the E3 SKU, where we've added some value, making sure we can still move people to that suite as well. And so you will see, right, over time, long term the seat growth move a little bit, and then you'll see ASPs show up. And it depends a little bit on mix, frankly, each quarter. You saw a little more ARPU in Q4. You saw a little less in Q1 that had to do with some E3 execution in Q1. But I actually think there's room to do both those things, and I felt that way now for a couple of years.",250.0,111.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.018018018018018018,0.009009009009009009,0.009009009009009009,0.0,0.009009009009009009,0.009009009009009009

Satya or Amy, as a follow-up on Azure, I'm curious how you foresee the magnitude of two different variables on cloud computing demand over the near to medium term. The first being economic pressures on the willingness of some customers to spend, and the second being the impact of the spiking energy cost perhaps as a facilitator for something to do more in the cloud. Do you see these as largely offsetting factors, or are you expecting the former variable to be a lot more prominent than the latter?

I mean the way we see it is, overall, macro will mean that everybody is going to optimize their build. In fact, as Amy said, our job number one for large swaths of our sort of even customer-facing organizations is to proactively help them optimize. In fact, our incentives in our customer success teams are lined up with them, helping customers “do more with less”. So that's sort of one side. The thing, though, from a customer perspective, the best way for them to align their spend with what is uncertain demand is to move to the cloud. So we see the value prop of the cloud. So the big winner in all of this will be public cloud, because public cloud helps businesses offset the risk of taking demand risk. The other side, as you described today, is the risk around supply chain or energy costs. And so that's another one best way to hedge against an energy cost and we, in fact, more energy efficient, is to move to the cloud. So that's where I think a little bit of – as you all think about what happens to cloud, for us, we look at this and say, this is a period where cloud gain share because we're still in the early innings of adoption.

One is, I'll call it, LinkedIn B2B advertising, where we clearly have a leadership position around both reach, quality of ROI, and will -- of course, it will be cyclically impacted, but we feel that the LinkedIn Engage continues to grow. And as that market comes back, our premium position LinkedIn owned and operated, I feel well very well positioned. We'll continue to invest in that space. The second point is the place where we are, again, very, very focused on. First, starting with our owned and operated. So when we talk about the overall active devices on Windows have grown by 20% over the pandemic. One of the big opportunities it opens up is for us to tick our own and operated inventory, right, whether it is Bing and Search, whether it's the Feed. And those are things that you see some of the growth. We are share takers in the browser. We are share takers in terms of engagement of the feed. And those are things that we are high leverage on top of the installed base that's now structurally changed in terms of growth. And then the third-party with Netflix, we're really excited about that, and we're going to look to grow our -- and first make Netflix a successful partner, but we're going to continue to grow our third-party business on the ad platform.

I want to start with the context I shared with our employees last week on the changing environment and our priorities. As I meet with customers and partners, a few things are increasingly clear. Just as we saw customers accelerate their digital spend during the pandemic, we are now seeing them optimize that spend. Also, organizations are exercising caution given the macroeconomic uncertainty. And the next major wave of computing is being born as we turn the world’s most advanced AI models into a new computing platform. In this environment, we remain convicted on three things. This is an important time for Microsoft to work with our customers, helping them realize more value from their tech spend and building long-term loyalty and share position while internally aligning our own cost structure with our revenue growth. This in turn sets us up to participate in the secular trend where digital spend as a percentage of GDP is only going to increase. And lastly, we are going to lead in the AI era, knowing that maximum enterprise value gets created during platform shifts. With that as the backdrop, the Microsoft Cloud exceeded $27 billion in quarterly revenue, up 22% and 29% in constant currency. Now, I will highlight examples of our innovation starting with Azure. Moving to the cloud is the best way for any customer in today’s economy to mitigate demand uncertainty and energy costs while gaining efficiencies of cloud native development. Enterprises have moved millions of calls to Azure and run twice as many calls on our cloud today than they did 2 years ago. And yet, we are still in the early innings when it comes to long-term cloud opportunity. As an example, insurer AIA was able to save more than 20% by migrating to Azure and reduced IT provisioning time from multiple months to just an hour. We also continue to lead with hybrid computing with Azure Arc. We now have more than 12,000 Arc customers, double the number a year ago, including companies like Citrix, Northern Trust and PayPal. Now on to data. Customers continue to choose and implement the Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform over the competition because of its comprehensiveness, integration and lower cost. Bayer, for example, used the data stack to evaluate results from clinical trials faster and more efficiently while meeting regulatory requirements and ASOS chose Cosmos DB to power real-time product recommendations and order processing for over 26 million global customers. Now on to AI. The age of AI is upon us and Microsoft is powering it. We are witnessing non-linear improvements in capability of foundation models, which we are making available as platforms. And as customers select their cloud providers and invest in new workloads, we are well positioned to capture that opportunity as a leader in AI. We have the most powerful AI supercomputing infrastructure in the cloud. It’s being used by customers and partners like OpenAI to train state-of-the-art models and services, including ChatGPT. Just last week, we made our Azure OpenAI service broadly available and already over 200 customers from KPMG to Al Jazeera are using it. We will soon add support for ChatGPT, enabling customers to use it in their own applications for the first time. And yesterday, we announced the completion of the next phase of our agreement with OpenAI. We are pleased to be their exclusive cloud provider and we will deploy their models across our consumer and enterprise products as we continue to push the state-of-the-art in AI. All of this innovation is driving growth across our Azure AI services. Azure ML revenue alone has increased more than 100% for five quarters in a row with companies like AXA, FedEx and H&R Block choosing the service to deploy, manage and govern their models. Now on to developers. Modernizing applications is mission-critical to any company’s operations today. And with GitHub, Visual Studio and Azure PaaS services, we have the most comprehensive portfolio of tools to help. GitHub is now home to 100 million developers and GitHub Copilot is the first at-scale AI product built for this era, fundamentally transforming developer productivity. More than 1 million people have used Copilot to-date. This quarter, we brought Copilot to businesses and we have seen strong interest and early adoption from companies, including Duolingo, Lemonade and Volkswagen Cariad Software Group. Now on to Power Platform. Power Platform is becoming an essential digital transformation tool as every business looks to streamline their operations and drive productivity in today’s environment. We are helping customers realize superior time to value with our end-to-end suite spanning low-code, no-code tools, automation, virtual agents and business intelligence. We are leading in robotic process automation. Power Automate has more than 45,000 customers from AT&T to Rabobank, up over 50% year-over-year. And we are making it easier for anyone to streamline repetitive tasks, introducing new AI-powered features to turn natural language prompts into complex workflows. Now on to business applications. Dynamics 365 is taking share as we help businesses digitize their service, finance, customer experience and supply chain functions. For example, G&J Pepsi-Cola Bottlers is moving from reactive to predictive field service. FUJIFILM is optimizing its operations. Investec is closing deals faster with conversational intelligence. Baylor Scott & White in Texas is using our digital contact center to enhance patient communications. And this quarter, we introduced our new Supply Chain Platform, helping customers like iFit and Kraft Heinz apply AI to predict and mitigate disruptions. Now on to Industry Solutions. Our industry and cross-industry clouds are driving pull-through for our entire tech stack. Our cloud for retail was front and center at NRF last week as we introduced new tools to help retailers manage their day-to-day operations and digitize their physical stores. Polish retailer Zabka has built the largest chain of autonomous stores in Europe with the help of our technology. In Financial Services, our new partnership with London Stock Exchange Group will deliver next generation of data analytics and workspace solutions. And in healthcare, we are rapidly becoming the partner of choice for any provider looking to generate real value from AI. With Nuance DAX ambient intelligence solution, physicians can reduce documentation time by half, improving the quality of their patient interactions. Now on to systems of work. Microsoft 365, Teams and Viva are essential for every organization to adapt to the new world of work. Microsoft 365 is rapidly evolving into an AI-first platform that enables every individual to amplify their creativity and productivity with both our established applications as well as new applications like Designer, Stream and Loop. We have more than 63 million consumer subscribers, up 12% year-over-year and we introduced Microsoft 365 Basic, bringing our premium offerings to more people. Teams surpassed 280 million monthly active users this quarter, showing durable momentum since the pandemic and we continue to take share across every category from collaboration to chat to meetings to calling. Teams has emerged as a first-class platform. Apps from Adobe, Atlassian, Poly, ServiceNow and Workday have each surpassed 0.5 million active users and the number of third-party apps with more than 10,000 users increased nearly 40% year-over-year. There are more than 500,000 active Teams Rooms devices, up 70% year-over-year and the number of customers with more than 1,000 rooms doubled year-over-year. Novo Nordisk will deploy Teams Rooms to 5,000 meeting rooms globally in our largest deal to-date. Teams Phone continues to take share and is the market leader in cloud calling. We have added more than 5 million PSTN seats over the last 12 months alone. With Teams Premium, we are meeting enterprise demand for advanced features like end-to-end encryption and AI-powered recaps. We have seen strong interest in preview and we will make it broadly available next month. With Microsoft Viva, we have created a new market category for our employee experience and organizational productivity. U.S. Bank is using Viva to streamline employee communications and Carlsberg turned to Viva to centralize its digital employee experience for 29,000 employees. In today’s environment, aligning the entire organization and the most important work is critical. Viva Goals brings objectives and key results directly into the flow of daily work. Viva has also become an indispensable tool for business process. Viva Sales is the super app in Microsoft 365 for sellers. We have seen strong interest since making it generally available this quarter. All up, we continue to see organizations consolidate on Microsoft 365. 80% of our enterprise customers use 5 or more Microsoft 365 applications. And organizations across the private and public sector, including EY, IKEA, NTT Communications, Rio Tinto as well as the state government of Virginia are increasingly choosing our premium E5 offerings for advanced security, compliance, voice and analytics. Now on to Windows. While the number of PCs shipped declined during the quarter, returning to pre-pandemic levels, usage intensity of Windows continues to be higher than pre-pandemic with time spent per PC up nearly 10%. Monthly active devices also reached an all-time high this quarter. And for commercial customers, Windows 11 adoption continues to grow because of its differentiated security and productivity value proposition. We are also seeing growth in cloud-delivered Windows with usage of Windows 365 and Azure Virtual Desktop up by over two-thirds year-over-year. Leaders in every industry from Campari and Grant Thornton UK to Nutrien and Woolworths are using cloud-delivered Windows, including more than 60% of the Fortune 500. Now on to security. Over the past 12 months, our security business surpassed $20 billion in revenue as we help customers protect their digital estate across clouds and endpoint platforms. We are the only company with integrated end-to-end tools spanning identity, security, compliance, device management and privacy informed and trained on over 65 trillion signals each day. We are taking share across all major categories we serve. Customers are consolidating on our security stack in order to reduce risk, complexity and cost. The number of organizations with four or more workloads increased over 40% year-over-year. UK retailer Fraser Group, for example, consolidated from 10 security vendors to just Microsoft. Roku moved identity and access management to the cloud with Azure Active Directory. And Astellas Pharma, Ferrovial and University of Toronto all switched to Microsoft Sentinel because of our integrated XDR and SIM capabilities. Now on to LinkedIn. People and companies continue to look to LinkedIn to connect, learn, sell and get hired. We once again saw record engagement among our more than 900 million members. Three members are signing up every second. Over 80% of these members are from outside the United States. And as the members come to the platform to find and share professional knowledge and expertise, newsletter creation was up 10x year-over-year. Skills are the new currency and people are increasingly investing in their skill-building to keep up with their changing roles in industries. We offer more than 20,000 courses in 11 languages and companies are also turning to a skills-based approach in place of degree or pedigree to identify qualified talent, with more than 45% of the hires on LinkedIn explicitly using skills data to fill their roles. Finally, LinkedIn Marketing Solutions continues to be a leader in B2B digital advertising, helping companies deliver the right message to the right audience on a safe and trusted platform. Now on to advertising. Despite headwinds in the ad market, we continue to innovate across our first and third-party portfolios. Our browser, Microsoft Edge gained share for the seventh consecutive quarter. Bing continues to gain share in the United States and daily users of our Start personalized content feed increased over 30% year-over-year. We are now empowering retailers and expanding our third-party inventory. With PromoteIQ, we are building a complete omnichannel media platform for companies like the Australian retailer, Endeavor, as well as Canada’s Hudson’s Bay and Global, the largest Brazilian TV broadcasters chose Xandr to launch a new media buying platform in that market. Now on to gaming. In gaming, we continue to pursue our ambition to give players more choice to play great games wherever, whenever and however they want. We saw new highs for Game Pass subscriptions, game streaming hours and monthly active devices, and monthly active users surpassed a record 120 million during the quarter. We continue to invest to add value to Game Pass. This quarter, we partnered with Riot Games to make the company’s PC and mobile games, along with premium content available to subscribers. And finally, we are energized by our upcoming lineup of AAA game launches, including exciting new titles from ZeniMax and Xbox Game Studios and we will be sharing details in Gameplay at our showcase tomorrow. In closing, I want to extend my deepest gratitude to our employees for their continued dedication to our mission, customers and partners. We will continue to pursue our long-term opportunity and innovation agenda with urgency while also raising the bar on our operational excellence. With that, I will hand it over to Amy.",2179.0,1165.0,37.0,5.0,7.0,3.0,1.0,10.0,2.0,3.0,0.03175965665236052,0.004291845493562232,0.006008583690987125,0.002575107296137339,0.0008583690987124463,0.027467811158798282
MSFT,2023-01-24,2023-01-25,,2023-01-24,2023-01-24T17:30:00-05:00,0,2023-01-24,qa,qna_heading,Amy Hood,"Thank you, Satya and good afternoon everyone. I’d like to start by reiterating Satya’s thoughts on the changing environment and our priorities, which underpin the decisions communicated in last week’s announcement. The resulting Q2 charge negatively impacted gross margin by $152 million, operating income by $1.2 billion, and earnings per share by $0.12. Our second quarter revenue was $52.7 billion, up 2% and 7% in constant currency. When adjusted for the charge, gross margin dollars increased 2% and 8% in constant currency, operating income decreased 3% and increased 6% in constant currency, and earnings per share was $2.32, which decreased 6% and increased 2% in constant currency. In our consumer business, the PC market was in line with our expectations, but execution challenges impacted our Surface business. Advertising spend declined slightly more than expected, which impacted search and news advertising and LinkedIn Marketing Solutions. In our commercial business, we delivered strong growth in line with our expectations. However, as you heard from Satya, we are seeing customers exercise caution in this environment and we saw results weaken through December. We saw moderated consumption growth in Azure and lower-than-expected growth in new business across the standalone Office 365, EMS and Windows commercial products that are sold outside the Microsoft 365 suite. From a geographic perspective, we saw strong execution in many regions around the world. However, performance in the U.S. was weaker than expected. Importantly, we continued to see share gains in areas such as data and AI, Dynamics, Teams, Security and Edge. Commercial bookings increased 7% and 4% in constant currency, lower than expected. Consistent execution across our renewal sales motions, including strong recapture rates and growth in Azure commitments on a high prior year comparable were partially offset by the slowdown in growth of new standalone business noted earlier. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 29% to 26% in constant currency to $189 billion. Roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 24% year-over-year. The remaining portion, which will be recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 32%. Our annuity mix increased 2 points year-over-year to 96%. FX decreased total company revenue by 5 points, in line with expectations. At a segment level, FX decreased Productivity and Business Processes revenue growth by 6 points, 1 point favorable to expectations. FX impact on Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing were both in line with expectations. Additionally, FX decreased both COGS and operating expense growth by 2 points, 1 point unfavorable to expectations. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $27.1 billion and grew 22% and 29% in constant currency, ahead of expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points year-over-year to 72%, a point better than expected, driven by lower energy costs. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased roughly 1 point, primarily driven by sales mix shift to Azure. Company gross margin percentage was 67%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased roughly 2 points, driven by a lower mix of Windows OEM revenue and sales mix shift from licensing to cloud. Operating expense when adjusted for the Q2 charge increased 11% and 13% in constant currency, about $500 million lower than expected. Operating expense growth was driven by investments in cloud engineering, the Nuance acquisition and LinkedIn. At a total company level, headcount ended December 19% higher than a year ago. Sequential headcount growth was less than 1%. Year-over-year growth included roughly 6 points from the Nuance and Xandr acquisitions, which closed last Q3 and Q4, respectively. Adjusted for the charge, operating margins decreased roughly 2 points year-over-year to 41%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins declined roughly 4 points, primarily driven by unfavorable FX impact as well as a lower mix of OEM revenue. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $17 billion and grew 7% and 13% in constant currency, in line with expectations when excluding the favorable FX impact noted earlier. Office Commercial revenue grew 7% and 14% in constant currency. Office 365 Commercial revenue increased 11% and 18% in constant currency, slightly better than expected with healthy renewal execution and ARPU growth as E5 momentum remains strong. Paid Office 365 Commercial seats grew 12% year-over-year with installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments. Seat growth was driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings, although we saw some impact from the slowdown in growth of new business noted earlier. Office Consumer revenue declined 2% and increased 3% in constant currency, with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 12% to 63.2 million, partially offset by declines in our transactional business. LinkedIn revenue increased 10% and 14% in constant currency, driven by growth in Talent Solutions, partially offset by weakness in Marketing Solutions from the advertising trends noted earlier. Dynamics revenue grew 13% and 20% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 21% and 29% in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars increased 8% and 16% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased slightly, driven by sales mix shift to cloud offerings. Operating expense increased 12% and 14% in constant currency, including roughly 5 points from the Q2 charge. Operating income increased 6% and 17% in constant currency as the 3 points of favorable impact due to the change in accounting estimate were offset by 3 points of unfavorable impact from the Q2 charge noted earlier. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $21.5 billion, increasing 18% and 24% in constant currency, in line with expectations. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue increased 20% and 26% in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 31% and 38% in constant currency. As noted earlier, growth continued to moderate, particularly in December, and we exited the quarter with Azure constant currency growth in the mid-30s. In our per user business, the Enterprise Mobility and Security installed base grew 16% to over 241 million seats with impact from the slowdown in growth of new business noted earlier. In our on-premises server business, revenue decreased 2% and increased 2% in constant currency, with continued hybrid demand offset by weakness in transactional licensing. Enterprise Services revenue grew 2% and 7% in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars increased 17% and 23% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased slightly. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage declined roughly 3 points, driven by sales mix shift to Azure and higher energy costs. Operating expenses increased 34% and 37% in constant currency, including roughly 13 points of impact from the Q2 charge noted earlier and roughly 7 points of impact from the Nuance acquisition. Operating income grew 7% and 15% in constant currency as roughly 7 points of favorable impact of the change in accounting estimate was offset by approximately 7 points of unfavorable impact from the Q2 charge. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $14.2 billion, decreasing 19% and 16% in constant currency, below expectations driven by Surface, Windows Commercial and search. Windows OEM revenue decreased 39% year-over-year, in line with expectations. Excluding the impact from the Windows 11 deferral last year, revenue declined 36% on a strong prior year comparable. Devices revenue decreased 39% to 34% in constant currency, below expectations due to execution challenges on new product launches. Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue declined 3% and increased 3% in constant currency, lower than expected, primarily due to the slowdown in growth of new business and stand-alone offerings noted earlier. Search and news advertising revenue ex TAC increased 10% and 15% in constant currency, a bit lower than expected, as noted earlier. Our Edge browser gained more share than expected this quarter. The Xandr acquisition contributed roughly 6 points of benefit. And in gaming, revenue declined 13% and 9% in constant currency, in line with expectations. Xbox hardware revenue declined 13% and 9% in constant currency. Xbox content and services revenue declined 12% and 8% in constant currency, given the strong first-party content last year. Segment gross margin dollars declined 29% and 24% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 7 points year-over-year, driven by lower device gross margin and sales mix shift to lower-margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 6% and 9% in constant currency, including roughly 6 points of impact from the Q2 charge noted earlier and 3 points of impact from the Xandr acquisition. Operating income decreased 47% and 40% in constant currency, including roughly 6 points of unfavorable impact from the Q2 charge noted earlier. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $6.8 billion to support cloud demand. Cash paid for PP&E was $6.3 billion. Cash flow from operations was $11.2 billion, down 23% year-over-year as strong cloud billings and collections were more than offset by a tax payment related to the TCJA capitalization of R&D provision as well as higher employee and supplier payments. Free cash flow was $4.9 billion, down 43% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of this tax payment, cash flow from operations declined 7% and free cash flow declined 16%. This quarter, other income and expense was negative $60 million, lower than anticipated, driven by a mark-to-market loss on a forward share purchase agreement. Our effective tax rate was approximately 19%. And finally, we returned $9.7 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Now moving to our Q3 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S. dollar basis. My commentary for both the full year and next quarter does not include any impact from Activision, which we continue to work towards closing in fiscal year 2023, subject to obtaining required regulatory approvals. First, FX. Based on current rates, we now expect FX to decrease total revenue growth by approximately 3 points, COGS growth by 1 point and operating expense growth by 2 points. Within the segments, we anticipate roughly 4 points of negative impact on revenue growth in Productivity and Business Processes, 3 points in Intelligent Cloud and 2 points in More Personal Computing. In our Consumer business, Windows OEM and devices will see continued declines as the PC market returns to pre-pandemic levels. And LinkedIn and search will be impacted as ad market spending remains a bit cautious. In our Commercial business, we expect business trends that we saw at the end of December to continue into Q3. While customers are more cautious in their spend, we also have the opportunity to improve our execution, given our strong position in global growth markets. In commercial bookings, with a declining expiry base and the strong prior year comparable in terms of large Azure contracts, we expect growth to be relatively flat over year. We expect consistent execution across our core and sales motions and continued commitments to our platform will be offset by impact from the slowdown of new business noted earlier and 3 points of unfavorable impact from the inclusion of Nuance in the prior year. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be up roughly 1 point year-over-year, driven by the accounting estimate change noted earlier. Excluding that impact, Q3 cloud gross margin percentage will decrease roughly 1 point, driven by Azure. In capital expenditures, we expect a sequential increase on a dollar basis with normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure build-out. Our data center investments continue to be based on a near-term and longer-term customer demand, including AI opportunities. Next, segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 11% and 13% in constant currency or $16.9 billion to $17.2 billion. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be sequentially lower by roughly 1 point on a constant currency basis. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the mid-20s. In Office Consumer, we expect revenue growth in the low single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect mid-single-digit revenue growth with continued strong engagement on the platform, although impacted by the advertising trends noted earlier and the slowdown in hiring, particularly in the technology industry, where we have significant exposure. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth to be in the low to mid-teens, driven by continued growth in Dynamics 365, which is now over 80% of total Dynamics revenue. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 17% and 19% in constant currency or $21.7 billion to $22 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per user business and from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, our per-user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect continued moderation in growth rate given the size of the installed base. As I noted earlier, we exited Q2 with Azure growth in the mid-30s in constant currency. And from that, we expect Q3 growth to decelerate roughly 4 to 5 points in constant currency. FX impact in Azure is about 1 point more than at the segment level. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline low single digits as demand for our hybrid solutions will be more than offset by unfavorable FX impact. And in Enterprise Services, revenue should decline low to mid-single digits, driven by Microsoft Consulting Services. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue of $11.9 billion to $12.3 billion. Windows OEM revenue should decline in the mid to high 30s, in line with the PC market. We expect Q3 PC units to be similar to pre-pandemic levels. In devices, revenues should decline in the mid-40s as we work through the execution challenges noted earlier. In Windows Commercial products and cloud services on a strong prior year comparable, revenue should be relatively flat as customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions will be partially offset by the slowdown in new business noted earlier. Search and news advertising ex-TAC should grow high single digits, roughly 7 points faster than overall search and news advertising revenue, driven by continued volume strength supported by Edge browser share gains and the inclusion of Xandr. And in gaming, on a prior year comparable that benefited from increased console supply, we expect revenue to decline in the high single digits. We expect Xbox content and services revenue to decline in the low single digits as growth in Xbox Game Pass subscriptions will be more than offset by lower monetization per hour and third-party and first-party content. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS to grow between 1% and 2% in constant currency or to be between $15.65 billion and $15.85 billion and operating expense to grow between 11% and 12% at constant currency or be $14.7 billion to $14.8 billion. Other income and expense should be roughly $200 million as interest income is expected to more than offset interest expense. As a reminder, we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains and losses on our equity portfolio, which can increase quarterly volatility. We expect our Q3 effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. And finally, as a reminder, for Q3 cash flow, we expect to make a $1.2 billion cash tax payment related to the TCJA capitalization of R&D provision. Now some thoughts on H2 and the full year. First, in our Commercial business, revenue grew 20% on a constant currency basis in H1. However, we now expect to see a deceleration in H2, given how we exited December. Next, higher energy costs for the full year are now expected to be $500 million compared to our previous estimate of $800 million. Third, as we continue to prioritize our investments and anniversary the Nuance and Xandr acquisitions, our Q4 operating expense growth should be in the low single digits in constant currency. Finally, we remain committed to operational excellence, aligning cost and growth, investing in our customer success and leading the AI platform wave. As a result, when excluding the Q2 charge and favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate, we expect full year operating margins to be down roughly 1 point in constant currency and roughly 2 points in USD, even with the headwinds from materially lower OEM revenue and higher energy costs. In the first half of the year, over 70% of our revenue came from our Commercial business and over 70% of that from Microsoft Cloud. We have a resilient foundation and durable growth markets where we are gaining share. I’m confident in the ability of our Microsoft team to manage the near-term by continuing to position ourselves for the future. With that, let’s go to Q&A.

I was hoping we could delve into the expansion of the investment into OpenAI. Satya, I was hoping you could talk to us about, is there any expansion in the scope of what you guys are doing with OpenAI and the commitment that you guys are making in terms of sort of the compute capacity you’re going to be giving to them? And then maybe as from an investor’s perspective, how should we think about when this functionality is going to become – expand beyond just sort of the Azure OpenAI services? And where are we’ going to start to see some of the positive impacts to perhaps Bing or the productivity suite or more broadly across the solution portfolio?",129.0,51.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0392156862745098,0.0196078431372549,0.0784313725490196,0.0,0.0196078431372549,0.0196078431372549
MSFT,2023-01-24,2023-01-25,,2023-01-24,2023-01-24T17:30:00-05:00,0,2023-01-24,qa,,Satya Nadella,"Thank you so much, Keith, for the question. So as you know, we started the OpenAI partnership now in 3 years, 3.5 years ago. And we’ve been actually working very hard on a lot of elements of this partnership over the last 3 years. And so I think the way for our investors to see this is we fundamentally believe that the next big platform wave, as I said, is going to be AI and we strongly also believe a lot of the enterprise value gets created by just being able to catch these waves and then have those waves impact every part of our tech stack and also create new solutions and new opportunities. So whenever we think about platform opportunities and platform shift opportunities, that’s how we come at it. How can we essentially ride the wave for everything that we have today and make it more expansive and then what new can be created. So, if you take that lens, the core of Azure or what is considered cloud computing fundamentally changes in its nature and how compute storage and network come together. That’s, in some sense, under the radar, if you will, for the last 3.5 years, 4 years, we have been working very, very hard to build both the training supercomputers and now, of course, the inference infrastructure because once you use AI inside of your applications, it goes from just being training-heavy to inference. So, that’s sort of, I think core Azure itself is being transformed for the core infrastructure business, it’s being transformed. And so you can see us with data beyond Azure OpenAI services even, think about what Synapse plus OpenAI APIs can do. We already have in Power Platform incorporated capability. You could prompt - I mean one of the reasons why we are the leaders in robotic process automation and workflow automation today is because of some of the AI capabilities that we have in there. GitHub Copilot is in fact, you would say, the most at-scale LLM based product out there in the marketplace today. And so, we fully expect us to sort of incorporate AI in every layer of the stack, whether it’s in productivity, whether it’s in our consumer services. And so we are excited about it. But I think that we are also excited about OpenAI zone innovation, right. So, they commercialize their products. We are excited about the Chat GPT being built on Azure and having the traction it has. So, we look to both, there is an investment part to it and there is a commercial partnership. But fundamentally, it’s going to be something that’s going to drive, I think innovation and competitive differentiation in every one of the Microsoft solutions by leading in AI.",466.0,196.0,10.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.05102040816326531,0.00510204081632653,0.015306122448979591,0.0,0.0,0.04591836734693878

There were some comments you had made that concerned, I think many about the state of the U.S. spending environment. I am just curious if you could comment and follow-up on what you are seeing there just from a spend environment throughout the year.

And first of all, I was making a comment which was sort of a global comment, not just a specific U.S. comment. I mean there is only – I always sort of subscribe to that there is only one law of gravity that I think all of us are subject to, which is inflation-adjusted economic growth in the world. And then how many times that do we grow, because as I have said in my comments, Brent, I fundamentally believe tech as a percentage of GDP is going to be much higher and on a secular basis. So, the question is how many times is it given the overall inflation-adjusted economic growth. So, that’s kind of how I look at it. Given that, I think the two things that we see, we commented on that even in the last quarter, and it’s even in the outlook, which is the thing that customers are doing is what they accelerated during the pandemic. They are making sure that they are getting most value out of it or optimizing it and then also being a bit more cautious on given the macroeconomic headwinds out there in the market. So, given those two things, the point is at some point, the optimizations will end. In fact, the money that they save in any optimization of any workload is what [Indiscernible] into workloads. And those workloads will start ramping up. And so one of the key things we are watching for, Brent, is to make sure that we are gaining share in this space through our value propositions, so and even build loyalty with our customers so that long-term, we are well positioned for share gains. So, that’s sort of fundamentally how we view it.  And then the other aspect I would also say is simultaneously investing in this new AI trend, because I don’t think any application start that happens next is going to look like the application starts of 2019 or 2020. They are all going to have considerations around how is my AI inference performance, cost, model is going to look like, and that’s where we are well positioned again. So, that’s how I view it. The market, you all are better readers of, quite frankly, what’s happening out there. We can tell you what we see. What we see is optimization and some cautious approach to new workloads and that will cycle through, but we do fundamentally believe on a long-term basis, as a percentage of GDP, tech spend is going to go up.",435.0,177.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.01694915254237288,0.005649717514124294,0.022598870056497175,0.005649717514124294,0.0,0.011299435028248588

I know we saw some slowing this quarter. You are guiding to some slowing next quarter in Cloud and Azure. How much of that is – do you believe at this point is truly people optimizing what they have already bought and stepping that before that versus how much of that is due to macro factors themselves specifically impacting demand?,78.0,37.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08108108108108109,0.02702702702702703,0.0,0.0,-0.08108108108108109

One is, it absolutely is, starts with workloads that they have at scale just because of the visibility one has on what’s driving essentially the consumption meters. And there is real guidance that we ourselves [Indiscernible] the product to say, here are the things that you could do optimize your billing. And so – so, that’s sort of what is the fundamental thing, when we say do more with less and how can we help, that’s sort of the first place customers go to.  And then the next piece, really, I think is going to be about how they take the optimization that they get and the savings they get along workload and what new project starts. And that’s where I think there is a reprioritization, when should we start the new project. And those are the two things that are happening simultaneously. They don’t perfectly match, but one of the things is they are looking to back some savings on some workloads and then start. So, that’s where I think a little bit of what has to happen is the cycle time where the optimization cycle finishes, the projects start and then the projects ramp. And I think that, that’s what at least on the cloud consumption side you are seeing. And on the per user side, it’s slightly different, which is in per user also, there was real acceleration when it comes to purchases of per user licenses, whether it is for knowledge workers or frontline workers. And again, they are all now making sure that they are all getting used and the usage is going up. Like when we look at our Office 365 usage, all those numbers are pretty up year-over-year in a substantial way. Like I gave you some of the Teams numbers, in fact, one of the things was what will happen to the Teams usage after the pandemic, guess what, they’re up. And so those are the good news. And now once we cycle through that again, the seats will get added and premium, like I am very, very excited about Teams Pro coming out in a couple of weeks. And those are all the things that people will be able to sort of use to ensure that the ARPUs are also going up with value.",405.0,167.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.023952095808383235,0.0,0.005988023952095809,0.0,0.0,0.023952095808383235

It’s all related when you start to say what’s the best ROI I can get on every budget dollar I spend in our job as a partner to so many of these customers is to help them do that. So, Satya has talked a bit about Azure. Let me talk a little bit about the per user where the way it showed itself is we had very high renewal rates and very good suite performance at renewal, meaning what we tend to call internally recapture. While we had some more challenges on maybe a standalone sale of a new product where the cycle is going to be a little longer, right, and you are going to have to show that cost savings. But the suite sale, the value in that showed itself in terms of strong E5.

So, the thing that I would say is when you are done with optimizing a workload is when you are done with the cycle. So, I think if you sort of say, when did we enter this, we accelerated existing [ph] workloads during the pandemic over a period of 2 years. So, we are optimizing. I don’t think we are going to take 2 years to optimize, but we are going to take this year to optimize.

Amy, given the obviously tough environment, it sounds like reaching that full fiscal year 20% constant currency commercial revs guide would be tough.

On the second half of your question, which is the guide of the exit rate – it’s off the exit rate on Azure of four points to five points, just to make sure that is clear. In terms of thinking about total year revenue, right, I did not comment on full year revenue as we continue, I think really just to watch the Windows PC market as it returns to pre-pandemic levels. Outside of that, as you can see, the trends are relatively consistent. So, in some points, it’s important because if you look at the operating income margin guidance that I talked about, the fact that we are guiding to really only one point of margin deceleration for the year on a constant currency basis with probably over $2 billion of headwind from the OEM business from what we had anticipated heading into the year, the focus on margins, the focus on prioritization, the focus on putting our investments into where we know they have high return, I actually feel quite good about the place that puts us in as we exit the year in terms of – and the right energy, right, or leaving the year in Q4 on leverage.",219.0,98.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01020408163265306,0.02040816326530612,0.02040816326530612,0.0,0.0,-0.01020408163265306

Obviously, as we think about the Q4 guidance around low-single digit operating expense growth, we start to, as you know, sort of lap certain real acceleration points that we had last year. And we lapped the acquisitions both of Nuance and of Xandr. So, by the time that we get to the end of Q4, you will see very moderated headcount growth on a year-over-year basis in addition to some of the prioritization decisions we have made. And you are right. We take decisions like the one we had to make to get our cost structure more in line with revenue just incredibly seriously because we have lots of very talented people who were impacted by that.

That’s a good question, especially because this quarter you started to see a little bit more of that ARPU influence. And as you might have gathered from your question and I will just reinforce it, as we see some of this moderating seat growth, whether that’s some of the new SKU weakness that we had talked about, some of the standalone stuff, you are starting to also see E5 ARPU happen at the same time. So, it does create some stability in that Office 365 Commercial revenue number. So, we are seeing still good seat growth, still growth across all workloads. And as you are pointing out, we are getting further into the E5 health, where we have seen, I want to say, four or four really good quarters of E5 adoption.

I mean even the workloads themselves, AI is just going to be a core part of a workload in Azure versus just AI alone. So, in other words, if you have an application that’s using a bunch of inference, let’s say, it’s also going to have a bunch of storage and it’s going to have a bunch of other compute beyond GPU inferencing, if you will. So, I think over time, obviously, I think every app is going to be an AI app. That’s I think the best way to think about this transformation. On your characterization of the large customers, whether there is any changes in their trajectory, I would say I would point back to, I think some of the commentary around every large customer is looking to optimize the workloads that they have at scale today and plowed some of that money back that they save into new project stock. So, that’s sort of what the classic pattern of large customers is. Sometimes you have ISVs who are different, right.

The Microsoft Cloud delivered over $28 billion in quarterly revenue, up 22% and 25% in constant currency, demonstrating our continued leadership across the tech stack. We continue to focus on three priorities. First, helping customers use the breadth and depth of the Microsoft Cloud to get the most value out of their digital spend. Second, investing to lead in the new AI wave across our solution areas and expanding our TAM. And third, driving operating leverage, aligning our cost structure with our revenue growth. Now I'll highlight examples of our progress, starting with infrastructure. Azure took share as customers continue to choose our ubiquitous computing fabric from cloud to edge, especially as every application becomes AI-powered. We have the most powerful AI infrastructure and it’s being used by our partner, OpenAI, as well as NVIDIA and leading AI start-ups like Adept and Inflection to train large models. Our Azure OpenAI Service brings together advanced models, including ChatGPT and GPT-4 with the enterprise capabilities of Azure. From Coursera and Grammarly to Mercedes-Benz and Shell, we now have more than 2,500 Azure OpenAI Service customers, up 10x quarter-over-quarter. Just last week, Epic Systems shared that it was using Azure OpenAI Service to integrate the next generation of AI with its industry-leading EHR software. Azure also powers OpenAI API and we are pleased to see brands like Shopify and Snap use the API to integrate OpenAI's models. More broadly, we continue to see the world's largest enterprises migrate key workloads to our cloud. Unilever, for example, went all in on Azure this quarter in one of the largest ever cloud migrations in the consumer goods industry. IKEA Retail, ING Bank, Rabobank, Telstra and Wolverine Worldwide, all use Azure Arc to run Azure services across on-premises, edge and multi-cloud environments. We now have more than 15,000 Azure Arc customers, up over 150% year-over-year. And we are extending our infrastructure to 5G network edge with Azure for Operators. We are the cloud of choice for telcos, and at MWC last month, AT&T, Deutsche Telekom, Singtel and Telefonica all shared how they are using our infrastructure to modernize and monetize their networks. Now on to data. Our Intelligent Data Platform brings together databases, analytics and governance, so organizations can spend more time creating value and less time integrating their data estate. Cosmos DB is the go-to database, powering the world's most demanding workloads at any scale. OpenAI relies on Cosmos DB to dynamically scale their ChatGPT service, one of the fastest-growing consumer apps ever, enabling high reliability and low maintenance. The NBA uses Cosmos DB to ingest more than 10 million data points per game, helping teams optimize their gameplay. And we are taking share with our analytics solutions. Companies like BP, Canadian Tire, Marks & Spencer and T-Mobile all rely on our end-to-end analytics to improve speed to insight. Now on to developers. From Visual Studio to GitHub, we have the most popular tools to help every developer go from idea to code and code to cloud, all while staying in their flow. Today, 76% of the Fortune 500 use GitHub to build, ship and maintain software. And with GitHub Copilot, the first at-scale AI developer tool, we are fundamentally transforming the productivity of every developer from novices to experts. In three months since we made Copilot for Business broadly available, over 10,000 organizations have signed up, including the likes of Coca-Cola and GM as well as Duolingo and Mercado Libre, all of which credit Copilot with increasing the speed for their developers. We're also bringing next-generation AI to Power Platform so anyone can automate workflows, create apps or web pages, build virtual agents and analyze data using only natural language. More than 36,000 organizations have already used existing AI-powered capabilities in Power Platform. And with our new Copilot in Power Apps, we are extending these capabilities to end users who can interact with any app through conversation instead of clicks. All up, we now have nearly 33 million monthly active users of Power Platform, up nearly 50% year-over-year. Now on to business applications. From customer experience and service to finance and supply chain, we continue to take share across all categories we serve as organizations like Asahi, C.H. Robinson, E.ON, Franklin Templeton, choose our AI-powered business applications to automate, simulate and predict every business process and function. And we are going further with Dynamics 365 Copilot, which works across CRM and ERP systems to bring the next generation of AI to employees in every job function, reducing burdensome tasks like manual data entry, content generation and notetaking. Now on to our industry and cross-industry solutions. Our Cloud for Sustainability is seeing strong adoption from companies in every industry, including BBC, Nissan and TCL as they deliver on their respective environmental commitments. Our Cloud for Healthcare was front and center at HIMSS last week as we expanded our offerings for payors and added new AI-powered capabilities for providers. We showcased the first fully AI-automated clinical documentation application, Nuance DAX Express, which will bring GPT-4 to more than 550,000 existing users of Dragon Medical. And at Hannover Messe manufacturing trade show, Siemens shared how it will use a Teams app integrated with Azure OpenAI Service to optimize factory workflows. Now on to future of work. Microsoft 365 Copilot combines next-generation AI with business data in the Microsoft Graph and Microsoft 365 applications, removing the drudgery and unleashing the creativity of work. Copilot works alongside users embedded in the Microsoft 365 applications millions use every day, and it also powers Business Chat, which uses natural language to surface information and insights based on business content and context. We've been encouraged by early feedback and look forward to bringing these experiences to more users in the coming months. Teams usage is at an all-time high and surpassed 300 million monthly active users this quarter, and we once again took share across every category from collaboration to chat to meetings to calling as we add value for existing customers and win new ones like ABN AMRO, Jaguar Land Rover, Mattress Firm, Unisys and Vodafone. We announced a new version of Teams that delivers up to 2 times faster performance while using 50% less memory so customers can collaborate more efficiently and prepare for experiences like Copilot. Teams is also expanding our TAM. Nearly 60% of our enterprise Teams customers buy Teams Phone, Rooms or Premium. Teams Phone is the undisputed market leader in cloud calling, helping our customers reduce cost with a three year ROI of over 140%. Teams Rooms revenue more than doubled year-over-year and Teams Premium meets enterprise demand for AI-powered features like intelligent recaps. Now generally available, it's one of our fastest-growing Modern Work products ever with thousands of paid customers just two months in. With Microsoft Viva, we have created a completely new suite for employee experience. Viva brings together goals, communications, learning, workplace analytics and employee feedback. Across industries, companies like Dell, Mastercard and SES are using Viva to help their employees thrive. Just last week, we announced Copilot for Viva, offering leaders a new way to build high-performance teams by prioritizing both productivity and employee engagement. And with Viva Sales, we have extended the platform to specific job functions, helping sellers apply large language models to their CRM and Microsoft 365 data so that they can automatically generate content like customer mails. All this innovation is driving growth across Microsoft 365, Ferrovial, Goldman Sachs, Novo Nordisk and Rogers all chose E5 to empower their employees with our best-in-class productivity apps along with advanced security, compliance, voice and analytics. Now on to Windows. While the PC market continues to face headwinds, we again saw record monthly active Windows devices and higher usage compared to pre-pandemic. We're also seeing accelerated growth in Windows 11 commercial deployments. Over 90% of the Fortune 500 are currently trialing or have deployed Windows 11. And with Windows 365 and Azure Virtual Desktop, we continue to transform how our employees at companies like Mazda and Nationwide access Windows. All up, over one-third of our enterprise customer base has purchased cloud-delivered Windows to-date. And new Windows 365 Frontline extends the power and security of Cloud PCs to shift workers for the first time. Now on to security. Our comprehensive AI-powered solutions spanning all clouds and all platforms give the agility advantage back to defenders. Among analysts, we are the leader in more categories than any other provider. And we once again took share across all major categories we serve and we continue to introduce new products and functionality to further protect customers. With Security Copilot, we are combining large language models with a domain-specific model informed by our threat intelligence and 65 trillion daily security signals to transform every aspect of the SOC productivity. And we also added new governance controls and policy protections to better secure identities along with resources they access. Nearly 720,000 organizations now use Azure Active Directory, up 33% year-over-year. And all up, nearly 600,000 customers now have four or more security workloads, up 35% year-over-year, underscoring our end-to-end differentiation. EY and Qualcomm, for example, both chose our full security stack to ensure the highest levels of protection and visibility across their organizations. Now on to LinkedIn. We once again saw record engagement as more than 930 million members turn to the professional social network to connect, learn, sell and get hired. Member growth accelerated for the seventh consecutive quarter as we expanded to new audiences. We now have 100 million members in India, up 19%. And as Gen Z enters the workforce, we saw 73% year-over-year increase in the number of student sign-ups. In this persistently tight labor market, LinkedIn Talent Solutions continues to help hirers connect to job seekers and professionals to build the skills they need to access opportunity. Our hiring business took share for the third consecutive quarter. The excitement around AI is creating new opportunities across every function from marketing, sales and finance to software development and security. LinkedIn is increasingly where people are going to learn, discuss and up-level their skills with more than 100 AI courses. And we have introduced new AI-powered features, including writing suggestions for member profiles and job descriptions and collaborative articles. Finally, LinkedIn Marketing Solutions continues to be a leader in B2B digital advertising, helping companies deliver the right message to the right audience on a safe, trusted platform. More broadly, we continue to expand our opportunity in advertising. Our exclusive partnership with Netflix brings differentiated premium video content to our ad network, and our new Copilot for the web is reshaping daily search and web habits. Two months since the launch of new Bing and Edge, we are very encouraged by user feedback and usage patterns. All up, Bing has more than 100 million daily active users. We are winning new customers on Windows and mobile. Daily installs of the Bing mobile app have grown 4 times since launch. We are making progress in share gains. Edge took share for the eighth consecutive quarter and Bing once again grew share in the United States. We continue to innovate with first-of-their-kind AI-powered features, including the ability to set the tone of chat and create images from text prompts powered by DALL-E. Over 200 million images have been created to date and we see that when people use these new AI features their engagement with Bing and Edge goes up. As we look towards a future where chat becomes a new way for people to seek information, consumers have real choice in business model and modalities with Azure-powered chat entry points across Bing, Edge, Windows and OpenAI’s ChatGPT. We look forward to continuing this journey in what is a generational shift in the largest software category, search. Now on to gaming. We are rapidly executing on our ambition to be the first choice for people to play great games whenever, however and wherever they want. We set third quarter records for monthly active users and monthly active devices. Across our content & services business, we are delivering on our commitment to offer gamers more ways to experience the games they love. Our revenue from subscriptions reached nearly $1 billion this quarter. This quarter, we also brought PC Game Pass to 40 new countries, nearly doubling the number of markets we are available. Great content remains the flywheel behind our growth. We have now surpassed 500 million lifetime unique users across our first-party titles. And I’ve never been more excited about our pipeline of games, including the fourth quarter launches of Minecraft Legends and Redfall. In closing, we are focused on continuing to raise the bar on our operational excellence and performance as we innovate to help our customers maximize the value of their existing technology investments and thrive in the new era of AI. In a few weeks times, we'll hold our Build conference, and we will share how we are building the most powerful AI platform for developers and I encourage you to tune in. I could not be more energized about the opportunities ahead. And with that, let me turn it over to Amy.",2219.0,1207.0,38.0,3.0,9.0,1.0,2.0,7.0,8.0,1.0,0.03148301574150787,0.0024855012427506215,0.007456503728251864,0.0008285004142502071,0.0016570008285004142,0.02899751449875725
MSFT,2023-04-25,2023-04-26,,2023-04-25,2023-04-25T17:30:00-04:00,0,2023-04-25,qa,qna_heading,Amy Hood,"Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter revenue was $52.9 billion, up 7% and 10% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.45 and increased 10% and 14% in constant currency. Our results exceeded expectations, driven by focused execution from our sales teams and partners. In our commercial business, revenue was up 19% in constant currency. We saw better-than-expected renewal strength, including across Microsoft 365, which also benefited Windows Commercial given the higher in-period revenue recognition. In Office 365 stand-alone products, we saw improvement in new business growth, while growth trends in EMS and Windows Commercial standalone products remained consistent with Q2. In Azure, customers continued to exercise some caution as optimization and new workload trends from the prior quarter continued as expected. In our consumer business, PC demand was a bit better than we expected, particularly in the commercial segment, which benefited Windows OEM and Surface even as channel inventory levels remain elevated, which negatively impacted results. Advertising spend landed in line with our expectations. We have seen share gains in Azure, Dynamics, Teams, Security, Edge and Bing as we continue to focus on delivering high value as well as new innovative solutions to our customers, including next-generation AI capabilities. Commercial bookings increased 11% and 12% in constant currency on a strong prior year comparable with a declining expiry base and 3 points of unfavorable impact from the inclusion of Nuance in the prior year. The better-than-expected result was driven by strong execution across our renewal sales motions mentioned earlier. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 26% to $196 billion. Roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 18% year-over-year. The remaining portion, which will be recognized beyond the next 12 months increased 34%. And this quarter, our annuity mix was again 96%. FX impact on total company revenue, segment level revenue and operating expense growth was as expected. FX decreased COGS growth by 2 points, 1 point favorable to expectations. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $28.5 billion and grew 22% and 25% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points year-over-year to 72%, a point ahead of expectations driven by cloud engineering efficiencies. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased slightly, driven by lower Azure margin. Company gross margin dollars increased 9% and 13% in constant currency, including 2 points due to the change in accounting estimate. Gross margin percentage increased year-over-year to 69%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased slightly, driven by a lower mix of OEM revenue. Operating expense increased 7% and 9% in constant currency, about $300 million lower than expected. Operating expense growth was driven by roughly 2 points from the Nuance and Xandr acquisitions as well as investments in cloud engineering and LinkedIn. At a total company level, head count at the end of March was 9% higher than a year ago. Operating income increased 10% and 15% in constant currency, including 4 points due to the change in accounting estimate. Operating margins increased roughly 1 point year-over-year to 42%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins decreased slightly and increased slightly in constant currency. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $17.5 billion and grew 11% and 15% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, primarily driven by better-than-expected results in Office commercial. Office commercial revenue grew 13% and 17% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 14% and 18% in constant currency, slightly better than expected with the strong renewal execution mentioned earlier and E5 momentum. Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 11% year-over-year to over 382 million, with installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments. Seat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings. Office commercial licensing declined 1% and increased 5% in constant currency, better than expected with 11 points of benefit from transactional strength in Japan. Office consumer revenue increased 1% and 4% in constant currency with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 12% to 65.4 million. LinkedIn revenue increased 8% and 10% in constant currency, driven by growth in Talent Solutions. Dynamics revenue grew 17% and 21% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 25% and 29% in constant currency, with healthy growth across all workloads. Segment gross margin dollars increased 14% and 18% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased slightly, driven by improvements in Office 365, partially offset by sales mix shift to cloud offerings. Operating expenses increased 4% and 5% in constant currency, and operating income increased 20% and 27% in constant currency, including 4 points due to the change in accounting estimate. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $22.1 billion, increasing 16% and 19% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue increased 17% and 21% in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 27% and 31% in constant currency. In our per user business, enterprise mobility and security installed base grew 15% to nearly 250 million seats. In our on-premises server business, revenue decreased 2% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency with continued demand for our hybrid offerings, including Windows Server and SQL Server running in multi-cloud environments, offset by transactional licensing. Enterprise Services revenue grew 6% and 9% in constant currency with better-than-expected performance across Enterprise Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 15% and 18% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased slightly. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage declined roughly 3 points, driven by sales mix shift to Azure and the lower Azure margin noted earlier. Operating expenses increased 19% and 20% in constant currency, including roughly 3 points of impact from the Nuance acquisition. Operating income grew 13% and 17% in constant currency, with roughly 6 points from the change in accounting estimate. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $13.3 billion, decreasing 9% and 7% in constant currency with better-than-expected results across all businesses. Windows OEM revenue decreased 28% year-over-year and Devices revenue decreased 30% and 26% in constant currency, both ahead of expectations. We saw better-than-expected PC demand, as noted earlier, particularly in the commercial segment, which has higher revenue per license, although results continue to be negatively impacted by elevated channel inventory levels. Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 14% and 18% in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations, primarily due to the strong renewal execution with higher in-period revenue recognition noted earlier. Search and news advertising revenue ex TAC increased 10% and 13% in constant currency, including 2 points from the Xandr acquisition. Results were driven by higher search volume with share gains again this quarter for our Edge browser globally and Bing in the U.S. And in Gaming, revenue declined 4% and 1% in constant currency, ahead of expectations. Xbox hardware revenue declined 30% and 28% in constant currency on a high prior year comparable that benefited from increased console supply. Xbox content and services revenue increased 3% and 5% in constant currency, driven by better-than-expected monetization in third-party and first-party content and growth in Xbox Game Pass. Segment gross margin dollars declined 9% and 5% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased slightly year-over-year. Operating expenses declined 5% and 3% in constant currency, even with 3 points of growth from the Xandr acquisition. Operating income decreased 12% and 7% in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases were $7.8 billion to support cloud demand. Cash paid for PP&E was $6.6 billion. Cash flow from operations was $24.4 billion, down 4% year-over-year as strong cloud billings and collections as well as lower supplier payments were more than offset by a tax payment related to the R&D capitalization provisions and employee payments primarily related to headcount growth and an increase in employee compensation. Free cash flow was $17.8 billion, down 11% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of this tax payment, cash flow from operations increased 1% and free cash flow declined 5%. This quarter, other income and expense was $321 million, higher than anticipated, driven by net gains on foreign currency remeasurement. Our effective tax rate was approximately 19%. And finally, we returned $9.7 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Now moving to our Q4 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S. dollar basis. My commentary for the next quarter and FY '24 does not include any impact from Activision, which we continue to work towards closing in fiscal year 2023, subject to obtaining required regulatory approvals. Now to FX. Based on current rates, we expect FX to decrease total revenue growth by approximately 2 points with no impact to COGS or operating expense growth. Within segments, we anticipate roughly 2 points of negative FX impact on revenue growth in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud and roughly 1 point in More Personal Computing. Overall, our outlook has many of the trends we saw in Q3 continue through Q4. In our largest quarter of the year, we expect customer demand for our differentiated solutions, including our AI platform and consistent execution across the Microsoft Cloud to drive another quarter of healthy revenue growth. Last year, we had our largest commercial bookings quarter ever with a material volume of large multiyear commitments. On that comparable, we expect growth to be relatively flat. We expect consistent execution across our core annuity sales motions with strong renewals and continued commitment to our platform as we focus on meeting customers' changing contract needs, which include shorter term, quick time to value contracts in this dynamic environment. Our key focus remains on delivering customer value. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be up roughly 2 points year-over-year, driven by the accounting estimate change noted earlier. Excluding that impact, Q4 cloud gross margin percentage will be relatively flat as improvements in Office 365 will offset the lower Azure margin and the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. We expect capital expenditures to have a material sequential increase on a dollar basis, driven by investments in Azure AI infrastructure. Reminder there can be normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure build-out. Next, to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 10% and 12% in constant currency or $17.9 billion to $18.2 billion. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365, with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be roughly 16% in constant currency. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the low 30s. In Office consumer, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect mid-single digit revenue growth driven by Talent Solutions with continued strong engagement on the platform. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the mid- to high teens, driven by continued growth in Dynamics 365. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 15% and 16% in constant currency or $23.6 billion to $23.9 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per user business and from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect revenue growth to be 26% to 27% in constant currency, including roughly 1 point from AI services. Growth continues to be driven by our Azure consumption business, and we expect the trends from Q3 to continue into Q4, as noted earlier. Our per-user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect continued moderation in growth rates given the size of the installed base. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline low single digits as demand for our hybrid solutions, including Windows Server and SQL Server running in multi-cloud environments, will be more than offset by unfavorable FX impact. And in Enterprise Services, revenue should be relatively unchanged year-over-year as growth in Enterprise Support Services will be offset by a decline in Microsoft Consulting Services. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue of $13.35 billion to $13.75 billion. PC demand should be similar to Q3, and given channel inventory still remains elevated, our revenue will lag overall market growth as it continues to normalize. Therefore, Windows OEM and Devices revenue should both decline in the low to mid-20s. In Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue should decline low to mid-single digits. While we expect healthy annuity billings growth driven by continued customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions, a reminder that our quarterly revenue growth can have variability, primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. Search and news advertising ex TAC revenue growth should be approximately 10%, roughly 5 points higher than the overall search and news advertising revenue, driven by growth in first-party revenue is similar to Q3. And in Gaming, we expect revenue growth in the mid- to high single digits. We expect Xbox content services revenue growth in the low to mid-teens, driven by third-party and first-party content as well as Xbox Game Pass. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS to grow between 3% and 4% in constant currency or $16.8 billion to $17 billion and operating expense to grow approximately 2% in constant currency or $15.1 billion to $15.2 billion. Other income and expense should be roughly $300 million as interest income is expected to more than offset interest expense. As a reminder, we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio, which can increase quarterly volatility. We expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be in line with our full year rate of approximately 19%. And finally, as a reminder, for Q4 cash flow, we expect to make a $1.3 billion cash tax payment related to the R&D capitalization provision. Now I'd like to share some closing thoughts as we look to the next fiscal year. With our leadership position as we begin this AI era, we remain focused on strategically managing the company to deliver differentiated customer value as well as long-term financial growth and profitability. As with any significant platform shift, it starts with innovation. And we are excited about the early feedback and demand signals for the AI capabilities we have announced to date. We will continue to invest in our cloud infrastructure, particularly AI-related spend as we scale with the growing demand, driven by customer transformation. And we expect the resulting revenue to grow over time. As always, we remain committed to aligning cost and revenue growth to deliver disciplined profitability. Therefore, while the scaled CapEx investments will impact COGS growth, we expect FY '24 operating expense growth to remain low. As a team, we have continually focused on pivoting our resources aggressively to the future as we execute at a high level in the moment to deliver value to our customers. That balance has enabled the company to successfully lead across a number of platform shifts over a number of decades. Therefore, we are committed to leading the AI platform wave and making the investments to support it. With that, let's go to Q&A.

Thank you guys for taking the question and congratulations on really a fantastic set of results in what we all know to be a still difficult environment out there. I think it really illustrates Microsoft's advantages and a lot of these technology innovations that you guys have been talking about. I wanted to ask you a question that I get probably more often than anything else and one that I frankly don't have a good answer to, and that's around the OpenAI partnership and particularly the accounting for that partnership. So I was hoping you could give us a little bit of color about how -- whether or not revenue is flowing from OpenAI into Microsoft on the CapEx side of the equation, whether there's any impact.

We're proud to have worked together for a number of years, leading to some of the announcements that you've heard us make more recently. And we talked about the foundation of our partnership remains that when we both are successful, the other benefits. When we grow, it helps them, and when they grow, it helps us. But specifically to your question on how does it show up, it's easiest in this situation, to think about them as a customer of ours like any other customer who would use the Azure infrastructure and our Azure AI services in service of supporting their end customers.

I'd like to drill into Azure and more specifically, Azure IaaS/PaaS consumption. IaaS/PaaS consumption has really stepped down recently, and it's important to understand the macro versus macro and optimization that will rebound, whether it's going to rebound quickly or is there a more fundamental issue? In other words, is it simply purely macro and everyone is stepping back a little bit and they're going to hit the pedal as soon as this comes back or is there something more fundamental that is driving corporate maybe to step back and that, that slowdown could sustain even when the IT spending rebounds.

And it's also important, I think to distinguish between what I'd say, macro or absolute performance and relative performance because I think that's perhaps a good way to think about how we manage our business. First is optimizations do continue. In fact, we are focused on it. We incent our people to help our customers with optimization because we believe in the long run that the best way to secure the loyalty and long-term contracts with customers when they know that they can count on a cloud provider like us to help them continuously optimize their workload. That's sort of the fundamental benefit of public cloud, and we are taking every opportunity to prove that out with customers in real time. The second thing I'd say is, we do have new workloads started because if you think about it, during the pandemic, it was all about new workloads and scaling workloads. But pre pandemic, there was a balance between optimizations and new workloads. So what we're seeing now is the new workloads start in addition to highly intense optimization driven that we have. The third is perhaps more of a relative statement because of some of the work we've done in AI even in the last couple of quarters, we are now seeing conversations we never had, whether it's coming through you and just OpenAI's API, right? If you think about the consumer tech companies that are all spinning essentially Azure meters, because they have gone to open AI and are using their API. These were not customers of Azure at all. Second, even Azure OpenAI API customers are all new, and the workload conversations, whether it's B2C conversations in financial services or drug discovery on another side, these are all new workloads that we really were not in the game in the past, whereas we now are. So those are the three comments that I'd make, both in terms of absolute macro, but more importantly, I think, what is our relative market position and how it's being changed.",364.0,156.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.019230769230769232,0.00641025641025641,0.02564102564102564,0.01282051282051282,0.0,0.01282051282051282

And so to talk to your point, we're continuing to set optimization. But at some point, workloads just can't be optimized much further. And when you start to anniversary that, you do see that it gets a little bit easier in terms of the comps year-over-year.

And the thing that we are very, very focused on is to make sure that we get it very efficient in the usage of those resources. If you think about sort of what the hyperscaler does, it's not just rack and stack sort of hardware. They use software to optimize the performance of a given workload and, in fact, heterogeneous workloads on a given set of hardware. And so we have many knobs that we’ll continuously continue to drive optimization across it. And you see it even in the -- even for a given generation of a large model, where we started them to the cost footprint to where we end in the cost footprint even in a period of a quarter changes. So you can expect us to do what we have done over the decade plus with the public cloud to bring the benefits of, I would say, continuous optimization of our COGS to a diverse set of workloads. The other thing I'd mention is that there are a lot of workloads now. Like one of the reasons why we got together with OpenAI primarily was we came out and said, this type of workload, whether it's a training or an inference workload is going to be much more generally relevant for us, not just in the context of AI.

It's that really even our first-party workloads and apps that are built, right, are built on the same platform, and we're able because we are a hyperscaler and because we have a large commercial cloud first-party as well as consumer apps like Bing that are first party, we're able to take advantage of that and GPU utilization, AI services utilization across the stack.

It's probably a good opportunity to explain a bit about how I think about where we are, which is -- if you look at all of the businesses we're in and we look about our competitiveness in those businesses. And this is before Satya started to comment a bit about our relative performance versus absolute. And I'll tell you that the energy and focus we put right now is on relative performance and share gains. Right now, we have the largest commercial cloud with increasing commitments by customers, with new workloads, new TAM opportunities that something you're talking about with customers. And our focus is going to be and will be on continuing to take a growing share of that while we continue to focus on our customers' success in getting a ton of value out of what we are selling, whether that's the E5 product, the Microsoft 365, whether that's Windows 365 to help, maybe it's on compute costs and PC cost, whether it's working across the Azure stack. And so with that opportunity plus in our consumer business, the largest number of active devices we've had in Windows, are still being used more being able to focus on edge share and being share and gaming -- bringing it to the PC as well across to mobile, these are the opportunities that we focus on as we think about next year. And so if we feel like and I do, that we are well positioned to continue to take share in so many key places, then I say, great, and we want to be able to focus on investing in AI, which I talked about, will increase COGS growth, but we're committed to making sure we have healthy profitability by keeping operating expenses low. And so what really this past year has been about, but really what Q3 starts to show is our willingness to pivot to the future to make sure we can keep all those commitments that Satya listed. So while I know that's not giving specificity, it is, in fact, how we think about long-term success, in being well positioned in big markets, taking share in those markets, committing to make sure we're going to lead this wave, staying focused on gross margin improvements where we can. Some of them will come in AI over time, given our commitment to the build-out. We will charge for those AI capabilities and then ultimately will deliver operating profit.",422.0,186.0,12.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.06451612903225806,0.0,0.010752688172043012,0.0,0.026881720430107527,0.06451612903225806

I mean, just to add to it, during these periods of transition, the way I think as shareholders, you may want to look at is what's the opportunity set ahead. We have a differentiated play to go after that opportunity set, which we believe we have. Both the opportunity set in terms of TAM is bigger, and our differentiation at the very start of a cycle, we feel we have a good lead and we have differentiated offerings up and down the stack. And so therefore, that's the sort of approach we're going to take, which is how do we maximize the return of that starting position for you all as shareholders long term. That's sort of where we look at it. And we'll manage the P&L carefully driving operating leverage in a disciplined way but not being shy of investing where we need to invest in order to grab the long-term opportunity.

So overall, we've taken the approach that we are not waiting for regulation to show up. We are taking an approach where the unintended consequences of any new technology is something that from day 1, we think, about as first class and build into our engineering process all the safeguards. So for example, in 2016 is when we put out the AI principles, we translated the AR principles into a set of internal standards that then are further translated into an implementation process that then we hold ourselves to internal audit essentially. So that's the framework we have. We have a Chief AI Officer who is sort of responsible for both thinking of what the standards are and then the people who even help us internally audit our following of the process. And so we feel very, very good in terms of us being able to create trust in the systems we put out there. And so we will obviously engage with any regulation that comes up in any jurisdiction.

The Microsoft Cloud surpassed $110 billion in annual revenue, up 27% in constant currency, with Azure all-up accounting for more than 50% of the total for the first time. Every customer I speak with is asking not only how, but how fast they can apply next-generation AI to address the biggest opportunities and challenges they face, and to do so safely and responsibly. To that end, we remain focused on 3 key priorities: first, helping customers use the breadth and depth of Microsoft Cloud to get the most value on to their spend; second, investing to lead in the new AI platform shift by infusing AI across every layer of the tech stack; and third, driving operating leverage. Now I'll highlight examples of our progress, starting with infrastructure. Azure continues to take share as customers migrate their existing workloads and invest in new ones. We continue to see more cloud migrations, as it remains early when it comes to long-term cloud opportunity. We are also seeing increasing momentum with Azure Arc, which now has 18,000 customers, up 150% year-over-year, including Carnival Corp., Domino's, Thermo Fisher. And Azure AI is ushering in new born-in-the-cloud AI-first workloads, with the best selection of frontier and open models, including Meta's recent announcements supporting Llama on Azure and Windows, as well as OpenAI. We have great momentum across Azure OpenAI Service. More than 11,000 organizations across industries, including IKEA, Volvo Group, Zurich Insurance, as well as digital natives like Flipkart, Humane, Kahoot, Miro, Typeface, use the service. That's nearly 100 new customers added every day this quarter. Mercedes-Benz, for example, is bringing ChatGPT via Azure OpenAI to more than 900,000 vehicles in the United States, making its in-car voice assistant more intuitive. And Moody's built its own internal copilot to improve productivity of its 14,000 employees. We're also partnering broadly to scale this next generation of AI to more customers. Snowflake, for example, will increase its Azure spend as it builds new integrations with Azure OpenAI. And KPMG has announced a multibillion-dollar commitment to our cloud and AI services to transform professional services. Now on to data. Every AI app starts with data, and having a comprehensive data and analytics platform is more important than ever. Our intelligent data platform brings together operational databases, analytics and governance so organizations can spend more time creating value and less time integrating their data estate. We introduced Microsoft Fabric this quarter, which unifies compute storage and governance with a disruptive business model. One month in, we are encouraged by early interest in usage. Over 8,000 customers have signed up to trial the service and are actively using it, and over 50% are using 4 or more workloads. All-up, we once again took share with our analytics solutions with customers like Bridgestone, Chevron and Equinor turning to our stack. Now on to developers. New Azure AI Studio is becoming the tool of choice for AI development in this new era, helping organizations ground, fine-tune, evaluate and deploy models, and do so responsibly. VS Code and GitHub Copilot are category-leading products when it comes to how developers code every day. Nearly 90% of GitHub Copilot sign-ups are self-service, indicating strong organic interest and pull-through. More than 27,000 organizations, up 2x quarter-over-quarter, have chosen GitHub Copilot for Business to increase the productivity of their developers, including Airbnb, Dell and Scandinavian Airlines. We're also applying AI across low-code, no-code tool chain to help domain experts automate workflows, create apps and web pages, build virtual agents, or analyze data using just natural language. Copilot in Power BI combines the power of large language models with an organization's data to generate insights faster, and Copilot in Power Pages makes it easier to create secure low-code business websites. One of our tools that's really taken off is Copilot in Power Virtual Agents, which is delivering one of the biggest benefits of this new area of AI, helping customer service agents be significantly more productive. HP and Virgin Money, for example, have both built custom chatbots with Copilot and Power Virtual Agents that were trained to answer complex customer inquiries. All-up, more than 63,000 organizations have used AI-powered capabilities in Power Platform, up 75% quarter-over-quarter. Finally, Power Automate now has 10 million monthly active users at companies like Jaguar Land Rover, Repsol, Rolls-Royce, up 55% year-over-year. And we're going further with new process mining capabilities in Power Automate, which are helping organizations optimize business processes and, in turn, build their AI advantage. Now on to business applications. We are taking share in every category as we help organizations across the private and public sector from Avis to Albertsons to Breville to Equinox and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs transform their mission-critical business processes. All-up, Dynamics surpassed $5 billion in revenue over the past fiscal year with our customer experience, service and finance and supply chain businesses all surpassing $1 billion in annual sales. This quarter, we brought Dynamics 365 Copilots to our ERP portfolio, including finance, project operations and supply management. And with our new Microsoft Sales Copilot, sellers can ground their customer interactions with data from CRM systems, including both Salesforce and Dynamics to personalize customer interactions and close more deals. Now on to our industry and cross-industry clouds. Our Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability is helping customers like Costco, Land O'Lakes and REI take action to meet their environmental goals. And in health care, hundreds of organizations are using our Nuance DAX ambient intelligence solution to automatically document patient encounters at the point of care. This quarter, we expanded our collaboration with Epic to integrate Nuance DAX Express directly into their industry-leading EHR system. Now on to future of work. Across industries, customers like Ahold Delhaize, Deutsche Bank, Novartis, Siemens, Wells Fargo are choosing Microsoft 365 premium offerings for differentiated security, compliance, voice and analytics value. And 4 months ago, we introduced a new pillar of customer value with Microsoft 365 Copilot. We are now rolling out Microsoft 365 Copilot to 600 paid customers through our early access program, and feedback from organizations like Emirates NBD, General Motors, Goodyear and Lumen is that it's a game changer for employee productivity. We continue to build momentum in Microsoft Teams across collaboration, chat, meetings and calling. We now have more than 1,900 apps in Teams app store. And companies in every industry, from British Airways, to Dentsu, to Eli Lilly and Manulife, have built over 145,000 custom line of business apps, bringing business process directly into the flow of work. Five months in, Teams Premium has already surpassed 600,000 seats as companies like BNY Mellon, Clifford Chance, PepsiCo and Starbucks chose the add-on for advanced features like end-to-end encryption and real-time translation. Teams Phone is the market leader in cloud calling with more than 17 million PSTN users, up 45% year-over-year. Teams Room is used by more than 70% of the Fortune 500, including L'Oreal, United Airlines and U.S. Bank, and revenue more than doubled year-over-year this quarter. And with Microsoft Viva, we are creating a new market category for employee experience. Viva now has 35 million monthly active users as companies like CBRE, Fujitsu and Unisys turn to the platform to build data-driven, high-performance organizations. Now on to Windows. The number of devices running Windows 11 has more than doubled in the last year, and we are seeing continued growth in Windows 11 commercial deployments worldwide by companies like AT&T, Krones and Westpac. We are also transforming how Windows is experienced and managed for enterprise customers with Azure Virtual Desktop and Windows 365, which together surpassed $1 billion in revenue for the first time over the past 12 months. Enbridge, Eurowings, Marriott International and TD Bank Group, for example, all chose cloud-delivered Windows this quarter. Windows 11 is also rapidly becoming a powerful new canvas in this new era of AI. We introduced Windows Copilot this quarter, helping every Windows 11 user become a power user with just natural language and are excited to put it in the hands of more people in the coming months. Now on to security. More than 1 million organizations now count on our comprehensive AI-powered solutions to protect their digital estate across cloud and endpoint platforms, up 26% year-over-year. More than 60% including leading enterprises like ABN AMRO, Dow and Heineken use 4 or more of our security products, up 33% year-over-year, underscoring our end-to-end differentiation. And we once again took share across all major categories we serve as we innovate to protect customers. In identity, Microsoft Entra ID has more than 610 million monthly active users, and we are adding SSE to our Entra product family to complement our leading identity solution and secure access to any app or resource from anywhere. Finally, our Security Copilot, the first product to apply this next generation of AI to SecOps will be available to customers via paid early access program this fall. Now on to LinkedIn. LinkedIn's revenue surpassed $15 billion for the first time this fiscal year, and membership growth has now accelerated for 8 quarters in a row, a testament to how mission-critical the platform has become to help more than 950 million members connect, learn, sell and get hired. Our Talent Solutions business surpassed $7 billion in revenue for the first time over the past 12 months, and our hiring business took share for the fourth consecutive quarter. We continue to use AI to help our members and customers connect to opportunities and tap into experiences of experts on the platform. Our AI-powered collaborative articles are now the fastest-growing traffic driver in LinkedIn. And finally, we are helping LinkedIn stay trusted and authentic. More than 7 million members have verified who they are or where they work, many using new integrations with Microsoft Entra as well as CLEAR and Hyperverge. Now on to search, advertising and news. While it's early in our journey, we are reshaping daily search and web habits with our Copilot for the web. This quarter, we introduced new AI-powered features, including multimodal capabilities with visual search and Bing Chat. We are expanding to businesses with Bing Chat Enterprise, which offers commercial data protection, providing an easy on-ramp for any organization looking to get the benefit of this next generation of AI today. Bing is also the default search experience for OpenAI's ChatGPT, bringing timelier answers with links to our reputable sources to ChatGPT users. To date, Bing users have engaged in more than 1 billion chats and created more than 750 million images with Bing Image Creator, and Microsoft Edge took share for the ninth consecutive quarter. More broadly, we are growing our ad network, which is now available in 187 markets spanning search, display, native, retail, media, video and connected TV. Now on to gaming. Last week, we extended our Activision Blizzard merger agreement deadline to October. We continue to work through the regulatory approval process and remain confident about getting the deal done. We are committed to bringing more games to more players everywhere. Great content is key to our approach, and our pipeline has never been stronger. We announced our most ambitious lineup of games ever at our showcase last month, including 21 titles that will be available via Xbox Game Pass. And we're looking forward to the release of Starfield this fall, Bethesda's first new universe in 25 years. All-up, we set new fourth quarter highs for monthly active users, driven by strength off-console, as well as monthly active devices. And we saw record fourth quarter engagement across Game Pass, with hours played up 22% year-over-year. And just last week, we announced Game Pass Core, bringing together online play from Xbox Live and content from Game Pass into a single offering.  In closing, I'm energized about the opportunities ahead. We continue to innovate across the tech stack to help our customers thrive in the new era of AI.  And with that, let me turn it over to Amy.",2026.0,1091.0,32.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,0.02933088909257562,0.002749770852428964,0.0018331805682859762,0.0009165902841429881,0.0018331805682859762,0.026581118240146653
MSFT,2023-07-25,2023-07-26,,2023-07-25,2023-07-25T12:00:00-04:00,0,2023-07-25,qa,qna_heading,Amy Hood,"Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $56.2 billion, up 8% and 10% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.69 and increased 21% and 23% in constant currency. In our largest quarter of the year, results exceeded expectations with focused execution by our sales and partner teams. These execution efforts led to share gains again this quarter in Azure, Dynamics, Security and Edge. In our commercial business, we continued to see healthy renewal strength, which includes our upsell and attach motions, particularly with Microsoft 365 E5. Growth of new business continued to be moderated for products sold outside the Microsoft 365 suite, including stand-alone Office 365, EMS and Windows Commercial products. As expected in Azure, we saw a continuation of the optimization and new workload trends from the prior quarter. In our consumer business, the PC market overall was in line with expectations, although the early timing of back-to-school inventory builds benefited Windows OEM. Advertising spend was slightly lower than anticipated, which impacted search and news advertising and LinkedIn Marketing Solutions. Commercial bookings decreased 2% and 1% in constant currency, in line with expectations against the prior year comparable that was our largest commercial bookings quarter ever. In addition to the healthy execution across our renewal sales motions mentioned earlier, we saw a record number of $10 million-plus contracts for both Azure and Microsoft 365. And the average annualized value for our large, long-term Azure contracts was the highest it's ever been, driven by customer demand for our innovative cloud solutions today as well as interest in AI opportunities ahead. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 19% and 18% in constant currency to $224 billion. Roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 13% year-over-year. The remaining portion, which we recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 22%. And this quarter, our annuity mix increased to 97%. FX impact on total company revenue, segment level revenue and operating expense growth was as expected. FX decreased COGS growth by 1 point, 1 point favorable to expectations. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $30.3 billion and grew 21% and 23% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased roughly 3 points year-over-year to 72%, also slightly ahead of expectations. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased slightly, driven by improvements in Office 365, partially offset by lower Azure margin and the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. Company gross margin dollars increased 11% and 13% in constant currency, including 2 points due to the change in accounting estimate. Gross margin percentage increased year-over-year to 70%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased slightly, driven by improvements in Office 365. Operating expense increased 2%, in line with expectations as savings across the company from our focus on prioritization and efficiency were offset by the charge related to the Irish Data Protection Commission matter. At a total company level, headcount at the end of June was flat compared to a year ago. Operating income increased 18% and 21% in constant currency, including 4 points due to the change in accounting estimate. Operating margins increased roughly 4 points year-over-year to 43%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins increased roughly 2 points, driven by improved operating leverage through disciplined cost management. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $18.3 billion and grew 10% and 12% in constant currency, ahead of expectations with better-than-expected results in Office Commercial, partially offset by LinkedIn. Office Commercial revenue grew 12% and 14% in constant currency. Office 365 Commercial revenue increased 15% and 17% in constant currency, a bit better than expected with particular strength in E5 upsell renewal noted earlier. Paid Office 365 Commercial seats grew 11% year-over-year with installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments. Seat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings. Office Commercial licensing declined 20% and 18% in constant currency with better-than-expected transactional purchasing. Office Consumer revenue increased 3% and 6% in constant currency with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 12% to $67 million. LinkedIn revenue increased 5% and 7% in constant currency, driven by growth in Talent Solutions, with some continued bookings impact from the weaker hiring environment in key verticals. Growth was partially offset by a decline in Marketing Solutions due to the lower ad spend noted earlier. Dynamics revenue grew 19% and 21% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 26% and 28% in constant currency, with continued healthy growth across all workloads. Segment gross margin dollars increased 14% and 16% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased roughly 3 points year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point, driven by improvements in Office 365. Operating expenses decreased slightly and operating income increased 25% and 29% in constant currency, including 3 points due to the change in accounting estimate. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $24 billion, increasing 15% and 17% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue increased 17% and 18% in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 26% and 27% in constant currency, including roughly 1 point from AI services, as expected. In our per user business, the Enterprise Mobility and Security installed base grew 11% to over 256 million seats, with impact from the continued growth trends in new business noted earlier. In our on-premises server business, revenue decreased 1% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency, driven by a slight decrease in new annuity contracts, which carry higher in-period revenue recognition. Enterprise Services revenue grew 4% and 5% in constant currency with better-than-expected performance across enterprise support services and industry solutions. Segment gross margin dollars increased 16% and 17% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased slightly. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage declined roughly 2 points, driven by sales mix shift to Azure and the lower Azure margin noted earlier. Operating expenses increased 10%. Operating income grew 20% and 22% in constant currency, with roughly 6 points from the change in accounting estimate. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $13.9 billion, decreasing 4% and 3% in constant currency, above expectations, driven by better-than-expected performance in Windows, partially offset by Gaming. Windows OEM revenue decreased 12% year-over-year, ahead of expectations due to 7 points of benefit from early back-to-school inventory builds, while the overall PC market was as expected. Devices revenue decreased 20% and 18% in constant currency, roughly in line with expectations. Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 2% and 3% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, due to the renewal strength noted earlier, even with the moderated growth of new business and stand-alone offerings. Search and news advertising revenue ex TAC increased 8%, a bit behind expectations due to lower ad spend noted earlier. Higher search volumes, share gains again this quarter for our Edge browser, and the benefit from the Xandr acquisition were partially offset by the impact from third-party partnerships. And in Gaming, revenue increased 1% and 2% in constant currency, lower than expected due to weakness in first-party and third-party content performance. Xbox content and services revenue increased 5% and 6% in constant currency and Xbox hardware revenue declined 13%. Segment gross margin dollars declined 2% and were relatively unchanged in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point year-over-year, driven by sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses. Operating expenses declined 9% and 8% in constant currency. Operating income increased 4% and 6% in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $10.7 billion to support cloud demand, including investments in AI infrastructure. Cash paid for PP&E was $8.9 billion. Cash flow from operations was $28.8 billion, up 17% year-over-year as strong cloud billings and collections were partially offset by a tax payment related to the R&D capitalization provision. Free cash flow was $19.8 billion, up 12% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of this tax payment, cash flow from operations increased 22% and free cash flow increased 19%. This quarter, other income and expense was $473 million, higher than anticipated, driven by net gains on foreign currency remeasurement. Our effective tax rate was approximately 19%. And finally, we returned $9.7 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, bringing our total cash returned to our shareholders to over $38 billion for the full fiscal year. Now let's turn to next fiscal year and start with a few reminders. First, the change in accounting estimate for the useful life of server and network equipment resulted in $3.7 billion of depreciation expense shifting from FY '23 to future periods. Our FY '23 operating income and margins benefited from this change in accounting estimate and that will be a headwind to growth in FY '24 as the benefit reduces to $2.1 billion. Next, my outlook commentary for both the full year and next quarter is on a U.S. dollar basis unless specifically noted otherwise. And my outlook does not include any impact from the Activision acquisition, which we continue to work towards closing, subject to obtaining required regulatory approvals. Now for some thoughts on the full year of FY '24. With the weaker U.S. dollar and assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to increase full year revenue growth by approximately 1 point with no impact to COGS or operating expense growth. The impact in H1 is expected to be greater than H2. At a total company level, revenue growth from our Commercial business will continue to be driven by the Microsoft Cloud and will again outpace the growth from our Consumer business. Even with strong demand and a leadership position, growth from our AI services will be gradual as Azure AI scales and our copilots reach general availability dates. So for FY '24, the impact will be weighted towards H2. To support our Microsoft Cloud growth and demand for our AI platform, we will accelerate investment in our cloud infrastructure. We expect capital expenditures to increase sequentially each quarter through the year as we scale to meet demand signals. We are committed to driving operating leverage, and therefore, we will manage our total cost growth across COGS and operating expense in line with the demand signals we see as well as revenue growth. Increased capital spend will drive higher COGS growth than in FY '23, and FY '24 operating expense growth will remain low as we prioritize our spend. Therefore, we expect full year operating margins to remain flat year-over-year, even with the headwind from the change in accounting estimate. And finally, we expect our FY '24 tax rate to be around 19%. Now to the outlook for the first quarter. First, FX. Based on current rates, we expect FX to increase total revenue and operating expense growth by approximately 1 point with no impact to COGS growth. Within the segments, we expect FX to increase revenue growth in Intelligent Cloud by 1 point with no impact to Productivity and Business Processes or More Personal Computing. In Commercial bookings, strong execution across our core annuity sales motions, including our renewal and upsell motions, along with long-term measure commitments should drive healthy growth on a growing expiry base. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should decrease roughly 1 point year-over-year, driven by the accounting estimate change headwind noted earlier. Excluding that impact, Q1 cloud gross margin percentage will be up roughly 1 point, primarily driven by improvements in Azure and Office 365, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure and the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. We expect capital expenditures to increase sequentially on a dollar basis, as noted earlier, driven by investments in our AI infrastructure. Reminder, there can be normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of cloud infrastructure build-out. Next to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 9% and 11% or USD 18 billion to USD 18.3 billion. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be roughly 16% in constant currency. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the low 20s. In Office Consumer, we expect revenue growth to be in the low to mid-single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits. Even with share gains in our hiring business, growth will continue to be impacted by the overall markets for recruiting and advertising, especially in the technology industry, where we have significant exposure. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the mid- to high teens, driven by continued growth in Dynamics 365. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 15% and 16%, or 14% and 15% in constant currency. Revenue should be USD 23.3 billion to USD 23.6 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per user business and from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect revenue growth to be 25% to 26% in constant currency, including roughly 2 points from all Azure AI Services. Growth continues to be driven by our Azure consumption business, and we expect the trends from Q4 to continue into Q1. Our per user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect continued moderation in growth rates, given the size of the installed base. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline low to mid-single digits against a prior comparable that benefited from annuity purchasing ahead of the SQL Server 2022 launch. And in Enterprise Services, revenue should decline low to mid-single digits year-over-year as growth in Enterprise Support Services will be more than offset by a decline in Industry Solutions. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue of USD 12.5 billion to USD 12.9 billion. Windows OEM revenue should decline low to mid-teens, including 5 points of negative impact from the earlier back-to-school inventory builds that were pulled into the fourth quarter. Our guide assumes no significant changes to the PC demand environment. In devices, revenue should decline in the mid-30s due to the overall PC market and adjustments we made in our portfolio with an increased focus on our higher-margin premium products. In Windows commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive revenue growth in the mid- to high single digits. Search and news advertising ex TAC revenue growth should be mid- to high single digits, roughly 5 points higher than overall search and news advertising revenue, driven by continued volume strength supported by Edge browser share gains. Growth will continue to be impacted by the advertising spend environment and third-party partnerships mentioned earlier. We continue to be excited by Bing usage signals and the longer-term opportunity as we invest in AI. And in Gaming, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth in the mid- to high single digits, driven by first-party and third-party content as well as Xbox Game Pass. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS between USD 16.6 billion to USD 16.8 billion and operating expense of USD 13.5 billion to USD 13.6 billion. Together, total cost growth should be around 6%. Other income and expense should be roughly $300 million as interest income is expected to more than offset interest expense. Two reminders. This does not include any impact from Activision on interest income and expense, and we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio, which can increase quarterly volatility. We expect our Q1 effective tax rate to be around 19%. And finally, as a reminder for Q1 cash flow, we expect to make a $2.7 billion cash tax payment related to the TCJA transition tax. We do not expect payment related to the R&D capitalization provision in Q1. In closing, as a company, we delivered on the FY '23 financial commitments we discussed a year ago on revenue and operating margin. A focus on operational excellence allowed us to achieve these targets while we delivered near-term value to customers and prioritized our investments to continue to lead in the future. As we start FY '24, we are excited for the opportunities ahead and remain focused on delivering the 3 key priorities Satya mentioned. We'll maintain our lead as the top commercial cloud by helping customers use the breadth and depth of the Microsoft Cloud. We'll continue to invest in our cloud and AI infrastructure while scaling with growing demand so we can lead the AI platform wave. And finally, we'll align our costs with growth as we are committed to driving operating leverage.  With that, let's go to Q&A, Brett.",2770.0,1668.0,40.0,20.0,29.0,9.0,8.0,17.0,1.0,5.0,0.023980815347721823,0.011990407673860911,0.01738609112709832,0.00539568345323741,0.004796163069544364,0.011990407673860911

Satya, you started your comments talking about how every customer conversation has the customer asking you about utilizing generative AI technology and how fast they could utilize that generative AI technology. What's the answer? What do you tell them in terms of the pace with which that could get into the marketplace and your customers can start using it? And then for Amy, how should investors think about just the fundamental gross margins behind these generative AI technologies? We understand there's going to be a lot of CapEx to ramp up underneath these. But what should we expect in terms of what the ultimate gross margin looks like underneath all these new generative AI solutions?",126.0,56.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03571428571428571,0.0,0.0,0.0

The fundamental guidance and conversation that we have with customers is twofold. One is the easiest path to value out of generative AI is to adopt certain solutions, for example, GitHub Copilot. In some sense, it's sort of a no-brainer to add productivity leverage for all of the software developers in any organization. Whether you're a bank, you're a retailer or you're a software company, it applies to everyone. So that's probably one of the things that we have seen very good -- even productivity data and great adoption. And then obviously, the excitement that there is already around the M365 Copilot. So first thing we sort of talk about is how we ourselves are deploying all these Copilots across, whether it's Sales Copilot or M365 Copilot or GitHub Copilot, how do you get maximum value out of these horizontal tool chain? And then on top of that, we have taken what we did underneath these products and built it out as a first-class tech stack, right, which we talked at our developer conference, called the Copilot Stack, and then with Azure AI tooling, made it possible for a someone like Moody's to build their own Copilot for their people. So to us, we want to be able to help customers build their generative AI applications on top of Azure AI, and with speed, if you will. And so those are the 2 things that we ask them to identify where they can get the maximum productivity leverage. And then we even swung with our own resources to help them get those things done. And the last comment I'd make is the cloud and data in the cloud enables all this because I think the diffusion cycle here, in some sense, we have a new set of cloud meters that are getting adopted faster because of everything else that came before it in the cloud. So those would be the observations.",335.0,144.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.027777777777777776,0.006944444444444444,0.013888888888888888,0.0,0.0,0.020833333333333332

I would also say I expect workloads and the gross margins of the workloads to be different, just like they are in the cloud today. I would also add one thing that's different than last time, we talked a bit about this before, is that we start out in a different place with more of a shared platform, which allows us to scale those gross margins a bit faster than last time. And we do expect, as you asked and Satya talked about, the pace of this adoption curve, we do expect to be faster. So you're seeing the CapEx spend accelerate in Q4 and then again in Q1, and we've talked about what it should look like the rest of the year. Now that being said, we're talking about all that and going through that transition while delivering in FY '24 over FY '23, effectively 1 point higher operating margins. Because if it's flat year-over-year, as we guided, with the headwind from the useful life change, when you correct for that, it's about 1 point higher. So I think the real focus here is being able to be aggressive in meeting the demand curve and focusing on the transition and growth in gross margins and delivering the operating leverage.",256.0,111.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.009009009009009009,0.009009009009009009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

One is, I think, overall in the cloud, you do see new project starts and then those project starts get optimized and then you sort of time-series all of that, and that's sort of what you see in the normal course. What happened here was during the pandemic, obviously, there were lots of new project starts and optimization in some sense was postponed, and that's where you're seeing, I'll call it, catch-up optimization. And that's something that, to your point, we will lap. Going into the next couple of quarters, I think, it will come down. And we are seeing new project starts, both traditional type of project starts, even cloud migrations, data applications and, of course, obviously, the AI applications.

Mark, really, first of all, both in Q4 and then talking about Q1, the acceleration is really quite broad. It's both on -- both the data centers and a physical basis plus CPUs and GPUs and networking equipment, think of it in a broad sense as opposed to a narrow sense. So it's overall increases of acceleration of overall capacity. And I think if you look back over really FY '23, you wouldn't have seen some of the pace on normal, what I would say, capacity adds, even for the normal Azure workload.

And I think just for perspective, I think it's sort of always good to think about it, right, where we have, what, 111 [bill] (ph) commercial cloud business growing at, what, 22% year-over-year. And then you had a CapEx growth, which is around the same number, 23%, 24%. So in some sense, it's sort of replacement capital plus some new capital that is going to drive new growth. So that's, I think, the scale. And we feel good about that structure of overall growth rates and how it translates into future TAM opportunity for us. And then to your other question on how all this translates into project starts effectively, the Copilot stack is available today on Azure. So we have everything from Azure AI tool chain where you can use obviously, Azure OpenAI or even you can use open models from Llama and Hugging Face models. You have all the Fabric and all of our operational data stores for what is one of the most useful patterns around generative AI as what is called Retrieval Augmented Generation, which is you take the data that you have in the data stores, use it in a prompt to generate completions, summaries, what have you. And so that's something that we've seen a lot of and the Copilots are fundamentally orchestrations of that. And so we have all of these services available. The thing that's fascinating is when you use something like Power Virtual Agent, you have a low-code, no-code tool to build effectively these AI products or full-fledged Copilots like we've built. And all the underlying primitives for that are available on Azure. The tool chain is available on Azure and the speed with which customers are able to deploy them, ISVs are able to build them, is pretty impressive.",308.0,134.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.04477611940298507,0.007462686567164179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03731343283582089

If I could, I just wanted to get your thoughts to shift the discussion away from COGS and the CapEx to more of the top line outlook. It looks like Azure growth rate is definitely starting to stabilize and generative AI contribution to Azure is measurably improving quarter-over-quarter, and optimization in a broader sense is also starting to settle down. Where does this leave with the company's outlook for Azure growth rate in the future quarters? Are we at a point where we've bottomed out, and we could start to see some acceleration due to the trends we discussed? And also if we take the superset of Microsoft Cloud, when you throw in the new pricing for Copilot, it certainly looks like the TAMs are opening up in a pretty significant way. So when you take the broader lens, that 21%, 22% growth rate that Satya and Amy referred to, what could be the outlook? Could we be too optimistic in entertaining hopes of some kind of acceleration in the years ahead?

So maybe I'll start and then, Amy, you can add because I think -- we do think about what's the long-term TAM here, right? I mean this is -- you've heard me talk about this as a percentage of GDP, what's going to be tech spend? If you believe that, let's say, the 5% of GDP is going to go to 10% of GDP, maybe that gets accelerated because of the AI wave. Then the question is how much of that goes to the various parts of our Commercial Cloud and then how competitive are we in each layer, right? So if you sort of break it down, you sort of talked about how Microsoft 365, we think of this Copilot as a third pillar, right? We had the creation tools. We then had all the communication and collaboration services, and we think the AI Copilot is a third pillar. So we are excited about it. Amy talked about how we want to get it out first and part of this preview. And then in the second half of the next fiscal year, we'll start getting some of the real revenue signal from it. So we're looking forward to it. But we think of it long term as a third pillar, like we thought about something like, say, Teams or SharePoint back in the day, or what have you. Then Azure, the way I think about it is we still are, whatever, you're inning 2 or inning 3 of even the cloud migration, especially if you view it, right, whether by industry moves to the cloud, segment move to the cloud as well as country adoption of the cloud, right? So there's still early innings of the cloud migration itself. So there's a lot there still. And then on top of that, there's this complete new world of AI driving a set of new workloads. And so we think of that, again, being pretty expansive from a TAM opportunity and we'll play it out. But at the same time, we are a $111 billion commercial cloud that has grown in 20s, and so therefore, we do hit law of large numbers. But that said, we do think that this is a business that can have sustained high growth, which is something that we are excited about.",397.0,154.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.025974025974025976,0.01948051948051948,0.01948051948051948,0.012987012987012988,0.0,0.006493506493506494

We see the demand signal is quite strong. It remains strong. I'm thrilled with all the product announcements we've made. I'm thrilled with them moving to paid preview and then moving to GA. They absolutely are expansive in terms of addressable market. They reach new budget pools is almost the way I talk about it a lot in terms of how CIOs or CFOs that I talk to think about that investment. So a growing opportunity. And as you know, we're focused on executing against that. And then revenue is an outcome.

And I absolutely understand we are excited, too, by the demand signal, the customer reaction, really the requests we're getting to be in the paid preview. It's all encouraging. As you know, we've -- last week, we announced pricing, then we'll continue to work through the paid preview process get good feedback. Then we'll announce the general availability date, then we'll get to the GA date. Then we'll, of course, be able to sell it and then recognize revenue. And that is why I continue to say that I am just as excited as everyone else about this, and it should be more H2 weighted. And we've, I think, given you some sizing opportunities. And I think I would use all that. But I do think this is really about pacing. And of course, we've still got to get our Security Copilot and some of the Dynamics workloads priced and released. And we'll continue to work toward that. And of course, I think one of the things that people often, I think, overlook is, and Satya mentioned it briefly when you go back to the pull on Azure, I think in many ways, lots of these AI products pull along Azure because it's not just the AI solution services that you need to build an app. And so it's less about Microsoft 365 pulling it along or any one Copilot. It's that when you're building these, it requires data and it requires the AI services. So you'll see them pull both core Azure and AI Azure along with them.

If I could just add to what Amy said, the platform effect here is really all about the extensibility of the Copilots. You see that today when people build applications in Teams that are built on Power Apps and those Power Apps happen to use something like SQL DB on Azure. That's like a classic line of business extension. So you'll see the same thing. When I have a Copilot plug-in, that plug-in uses Azure AI, Azure meters, Azure data sources, Azure semantic search.

I mean if you think about Azure, we have grown Azure over the years coming from behind. And here we are as a strong #2 in the lead when it comes to these new workloads. So for example, we are seeing new logos, customers who may have used out of the cloud for most of what they do, or for the first time, sort of starting to use Azure for some of their new AI workloads. We also have even customers who've used multiple clouds who use that for a class of sort of workloads also start new projects when it's transferred in data and AI, which they were using other clouds. So what I think you will see us is more share gains, more logo gains, reducing our CAC even. And so those are the things of points of leverage.

Can you just talk about where customers are right now in that journey to have a more, I guess, thoughtful data strategy? And what does that mean in terms of their ability to adopt AI services?

I think having your data, in particular, in the cloud is sort of key to how you can take advantage of essentially these new AI reasoning engines to complement, I'll call it, your databases because these AI engines are not databases, but they can reason over your data and to help you then get more insights, more completions, more predictions, more summaries, and what have you. So those are the things when we say Copilot design pattern, that's sort of what that design pattern is all about. The thing that perhaps even in the last quarter, and I had that in my remarks, that's most exciting is how with Microsoft Fabric, especially for the analytics workloads, we brought together compute, storage, governance with a very disruptive business model. I mean to give you a flavor for it, right, so you have your data in an Azure data lake. You can bring SQL Compute to it. You can bring Spark to it. You can bring Azure AI or Azure OpenAI to it, right? So the fact is you have storage separated from all these compute meters, and they're all interchangeable, right? So you don't have to buy each of these separately. That's the disruptive business model. So I feel that we are well -- Microsoft is very well positioned with the way our data architecture lays out our business model around data and how people will plan to use data with AI services.

MSFT,2023-10-24,2023-10-25,,2023-10-24,2023-10-24T17:30:00-04:00,0,2023-10-24,prepared,,Satya Nadella,"Thank you, Brett. We are off to a strong start to the fiscal year, driven by the continued strength in Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $31.8 billion in quarterly revenue, up 24%. With Copilots, we are making the age of AI real for people and businesses everywhere. We are rapidly infusing AI across every layer of the tech stack, and for every role and business process to drive productivity gains for our customers. Now I'll highlight examples of our progress starting with infrastructure. Azure again took share as organizations bring their workloads to our cloud. We have the most comprehensive cloud footprint with more than 60 data center regions worldwide, as well as, the best AI infrastructure for both training and inference. And we also have our AI services deployed in more regions, than any other cloud provider. This quarter, we announced the general availability of our next-generation H100 Virtual Machines. Azure AI provides access to best-in-class frontier models from OpenAI and open-source models, including our own, as well as from Meta and Hugging Face, which customers can use to build their own AI apps while meeting specific cost latency, and performance needs. Because of our overall differentiation more than 18,000 organizations now use Azure OpenAI services, including new to Azure customers. And we are expanding our reach with digital-first companies with OpenAI APIs as leading AI start-ups use OpenAI to power their AI solutions, therefore, making them Azure customers as well. We continue to see more cloud migrations with Azure Arc. We're meeting customers where they are, helping them run apps across on-prem edge and multi-cloud environments. We now have 21,000 Arc customers up 140% year-over-year. We are the only other cloud provider to run Oracle's database services, making it simpler for customers to migrate their on-prem Oracle databases to our cloud. Customers like PepsiCo and Vodafone will have access to a seamless fully integrated experience for deploying, managing, and using Oracle database instances on Azure. And we are the cloud of choice for customers' SAP workloads too. Companies like Brother Industries, Hanes, ZEISS, and ZF Group all run SAP on Azure. Now on to data, in the age of Copilots, organizations are looking to consolidate their data estate, that's why with our Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform, we are bringing together operational data stores, analytics, and governance. More than 73% of the Fortune 1000 use three or more of our data solutions today. And with Microsoft Fabric, we are unifying compute, storage, and governance into one end-to-end analytical solution with an all-inclusive business model. More than 16,000 customers are actively using Fabric, including over 50% of the Fortune 500. Now on to developers. With GitHub Copilot, we are increasing developer productivity by up to 55%, while helping them stay in the flow and bringing the joy back to coding. We have over 1 million paid Copilot users and more than 37,000 organizations have subscribed to Copilot for business, up 40% quarter-over-quarter with significant traction outside the United States. This quarter we added new capabilities with GitHub Copilot Chat, which are already being used by both digital natives like Shopify, as well as, leading enterprises like Maersk and PwC to supercharge the productivity of their software developers. All up, the number of developers using GitHub has increased 4x since our acquisition five years ago. We've also brought Copilot to Power Platform, enabling anyone to use natural language to create apps, build virtual agents and analyze data. More than 126,000 organizations, including 3M, Equinor, Lumen Technologies, Nationwide, PG&E, and Toyota have all used Copilot in Power Platform to date. EY for example has enabled Copilot for all 170,000 plus Power Platform users at the company. And this quarter we added new Copilot capabilities to Power Pages making it possible to build a data-driven website using just a few sentences or clicks. Finally, Power Apps remains the market leader and low-code no-code development, now with 20 million monthly active users, up 40% year-over-year. Now on to business applications, all-up Dynamics 365 took share for the 10th consecutive quarter. We're using this AI inflection point to redefine our role in business applications. We are becoming the Copilot-led business process transformation layer on top of existing CRM systems like Salesforce. For example, our Sales Copilot help sellers that more than 15,000 organizations including Rockwell Automation, Sandvik Coromant, Securitas, and Teleperformance, personalize customer interactions based on data from third-party CRMs. We're also bringing Copilot to Dynamics 365 to help with everything from suggested actions and content ideas, to faster access to valuable business data. And this quarter, we introduced Copilot in Dynamics 365 Field Service, to help streamline frontline tasks. Now on to industry and cross-industry clouds. In healthcare, our Dragon Ambient eXperience solution helps clinicians automatically document patient interactions at the point of care. It's been used across more than 10 million interactions to date. And with DAX Copilot, we are applying generative AI models to draft high-quality clinical notes in seconds, increasing physician productivity and reducing burnout. For example, Atrium Health, a leading provider in Southeast United States credits DAX Copilot with helping its physicians each save up to 40 minutes per day in documentation time. We are also introducing healthcare data solutions in Microsoft Fabric, enabling providers like Northwestern Medicine and SingHealth to unify health data in a secure, compliant way. And with our Microsoft Cloud for sovereignty, which will become generally available by the end of the calendar year, we offer industry-leading data sovereignty and encryption controls, meeting the specific needs of public sector customers around the world. Now on to the future of work. Copilot is your everyday AI assistant, helping you be more creative in Word, more analytical in Excel, more expressive in PowerPoint, more productive in Outlook, and more collaborative in Teams. Tens of thousands of employees at customers like Bayer, KPMG, Mayo Clinic, Suncorp, and Visa, including 40% of the Fortune 100, are using Copilot as part of our early access program. Customers tell us that once they use Copilot, they can't imagine work without it and we are excited to make it generally available for enterprise customers next week. This quarter, we also introduced a new hero experience in Copilot, helping employees tap into their entire universe of work, data, and knowledge using chat (ph). And the new Copilot Lab helps employees build new work habits for this era of AI, by helping them turn good prompts into great ones. When it comes to Teams, usage continues to grow with more than 320 million monthly active users, making Teams the place to work across chat, collaboration, meetings, and calling. This quarter, we introduced a new version of Teams that is up to 2 times faster, while using 50% less memory and includes seamless cross-tenant communications and collaboration. We've seen nine consecutive quarters of triple-digit revenue growth for Teams Rooms, and more than 10,000 paid customers now use Teams Premium. Teams has also become a multiplayer canvas for business process. There are more than 2,000 apps in Teams Store, and collaborative apps from Adobe, Atlassian and Workday, each exceeded 1 million monthly active users on Teams. And with Viva, we have created a new market category for employee experience, helping companies like Dell, Lloyds Banking Group, and PayPal build high-performance organizations. With skills in Viva, we're bringing together information from Microsoft 365 and LinkedIn to help employers understand workforce gaps, and suggest personalized learning content to address it, all in the flow of work. All up, we continue to see more organizations choose Microsoft 365, and companies across the private and public sectors including Cerberus, Chanel, and DXC Technology, all rely on our Premium E5 offerings for advanced security compliance, voice, and analytics. Now on to Windows, the PC market unit volumes were at roughly pre-pandemic levels and we continue to innovate across Windows, adding differentiated AI-powered experiences to the operating system. We rolled out the biggest update to Windows 11 ever adding 150 new features including new AI-powered experiences in apps, like, Clipchamp, Paint, and Photos, and we introduced Copilot in Windows, the Everyday AI companion, which incorporates the context to the web, your work data and what you are doing on the PC to provide better assistance. We are seeing accelerated Windows 11 deployments worldwide from companies like BP, Eurowings, Kantar, and RBC. Finally, with Windows 365 Boot and Switch, we're making it easier than ever for employees at companies like Crocs, Hamburg Commercial Bank, the ING Bank to get a personalized Windows 365 Cloud PC with Copilot on any device. Now on to security. The speed, scale, and sophistication of cyberattacks today is unparalleled and security is the number one priority for CIOs worldwide. We see high-demand for Security Copilot, the industry's first and most advanced generative AI product, which is now seamlessly integrated with Microsoft 365 Defender. Dozens of organizations including Bridgewater, Fidelity National Financial, and Government of Alberta have been using Copilot in Preview, and early feedback has been positive. And we look forward to bringing Copilot to hundreds of organizations in the coming months as part of the new early access program, so they can improve the productivity of their own, security operation centers and stop threats at machine speeds. More broadly, we continue to take share across all major categories we serve, and our SIEM, Microsoft Sentinel now has more than 25,000 customers in revenue, surpassed $1 billion annual run-rate, and customers in every industry like Booz Allen Hamilton, Grant Thornton and MetLife use our end-to-end solutions to protect their environments. Now on to LinkedIn. We are now applying this new generation of AI to transform how the 985 million members learn, sell and get hired. Membership growth has now accelerated each quarter for over two years in a row. This quarter, we introduced new AI-driven features across all of our businesses, including our learning coach that gives members personalized content guidelines, and tools to help employers find qualified candidates and sellers and marketers attract buyers in a single step. Since introducing AI-assisted messages for recruiters five months ago, three-fourths of them say, it saved them time. And we have seen a nearly 80% increase in members watching AI-related learning courses this quarter. More broadly, we continue to see record engagement and knowledge sharing on the platform. We now have more than 450 million newsletter subscriptions globally, up 3x year-over-year. Premium subscription sign-ups were up 55% year-over-year and our hiring business took share for the fifth consecutive quarter. Now on to search, advertising, and news. With our Copilot for the Web, we are redefining how people use the Internet to search and create. Bing users have engaged in more than 1.9 billion chats, and Microsoft Edge has now gained share for 10 consecutive quarters. This quarter, we introduced new personalized answers, as well as, support for DALL-E 3, helping people get more relevant answers and to create incredibly realistic images with more than 1.8 billion images have been created to-date. And with our Copilot and Shopping, people can find more tailored recommendations and better deals. We're also expanding to new endpoints, bringing Bing to Meta's AI chat experience in order to provide more up-to-date answers, as well as access to real-time search information. Finally, we are integrating this new generation of AI directly into our ad platforms to more effectively connect marketeers to customer intent in chat experiences, both from us as well as customers like Axel Springer and Snap. Now on to gaming. We were delighted to close our acquisition of Activision Blizzard King earlier this month. Together, we will advance our goal of bringing great games to players everywhere on any endpoint. Already with Game Pass, we're redefining how games are distributed, played, and discovered. We set a record for hours played per subscriber this quarter. We released Starfield this quarter to broader acclaim, more than 11 million people have played the game to date. Nearly half of the hours played have been on PC and on launch day, we set a record for the most Game Pass subscriptions added on a single day ever. Minecraft has now surpassed 300 million copies sold, and with Activision Blizzard King, we now adds significant depth to our content portfolio. We will have $13 billion-plus franchises from Candy Crush, Diablo, and Halo to Warcraft, Elder Scrolls and Gears of War. And we're looking forward to one of our strongest first-party holiday lineups ever, including new titles like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and Forza Motorsport. In closing, we are rapidly innovating to expand our opportunity across our consumer and commercial businesses, as we help our customers thrive in this new era. In just a few weeks, we'll be holding our flagship Ignite Conference, where we will introduce more than 100 new products and capabilities, including exciting new AI innovations. I encourage you to tune in. With that, I'll turn it over to Amy.",2169.0,1179.0,39.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,3.0,0.03307888040712468,0.0016963528413910093,0.005089058524173028,0.0,0.0,0.031382527565733676
MSFT,2023-10-24,2023-10-25,,2023-10-24,2023-10-24T17:30:00-04:00,0,2023-10-24,qa,qna_heading,Amy Hood,"Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter's revenue was $56.5 billion, up 13% and 12% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.99 and increased 27% and 26% in constant currency. Consistent execution by our sales teams and partners drove a strong start to the fiscal year. Results exceeded expectations and we saw share gains again this quarter across many businesses, as customers adopt our innovative solutions to transform their businesses. In our commercial business, the trends from the prior quarter continued. We saw healthy renewals, particularly in Microsoft 365 E5 and growth of new business continued to be moderated for standalone products sold outside the Microsoft 365 suite. In Azure, as expected the optimization trends were similar to Q4. Higher-than-expected AI consumption contributed to revenue growth in Azure. And our consumer business, PC market unit volumes are returning to pre-pandemic levels. Advertising spend, landed roughly in line with our expectations and in gaming strong engagement helped by the Starfield launch benefited Xbox content and services. Commercial bookings increased 14% and 17% in constant currency, in line with expectations, primarily driven by strong execution across our core annuity sales motions, with continued growth in the number of $10 million plus contracts for both Azure and Microsoft 365. Commercial remaining performance obligation, increased 18% to $212 billion, and roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 15% year-over-year. The remaining portion, which will be recognized beyond the next 12 months increased 20% and this quarter, our annuity mix was 96%. FX did not have a significant impact on our results and was roughly in line with our expectations on total company revenue, segment-level revenue, COGS, and operating expense growth. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $31.8 billion and grew 24% and 23% in constant currency, ahead of expectations. Microsoft Cloud's gross margin percentage increased slightly year-over-year to 73%, a point better than expected, primarily driven by improvements in Azure. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, Microsoft Cloud's gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points, driven by the improvement just mentioned in Azure as well as Office 365, partially offset by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. Company gross margin dollars increased 16% and 15% in constant currency and gross margin percentage increased year-over-year to 71%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, the gross margin percentage increased roughly 3 points, driven by the improvement in Azure and Office 365 as well as sales mix shift to higher margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 1%, lower than expected due to cost-efficiency focus as well as investments that shifted to future quarters. Operating expense growth was driven by marketing, LinkedIn, and cloud engineering, partially offset by devices. At a total company level, headcount at the end of September was 7% lower than a year ago. Operating income increased 25% and 24% in constant currency. Operating margins increased roughly 5 points year-over-year to 48%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins increased roughly 6 six points, driven by improved operating leverage through cost management and the higher gross margin noted earlier. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $18.6 billion and grew 13% and 12% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected results in Office 365 Commercial and LinkedIn. Office Commercial revenue grew 15% and 14% in constant currency. Office 365 Commercial revenue increased 18% and 17% in constant currency, slightly better than expected with a bit more in-period revenue recognition, while billings remained relatively in line with expectations. Growth continues to be driven by healthy renewal execution and ARPU growth, as E5 momentum remains strong. Paid Office 365 Commercial seats grew 10% year-over-year, with installed-base expansion across all customer segments. Seat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings with continued impact from the growth trends in new standalone business noted earlier. Office Commercial licensing declined 17%, in line with the continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Office Consumer revenue increased 3% and 4% in constant currency with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 18% to 76.7 million. LinkedIn revenue increased 8%, ahead of expectations, driven by slightly better-than-expected performance across all businesses. Growth was driven by Talent Solutions, though we continue to see negative year-over-year bookings there from the weaker hiring environment in key verticals. Dynamics revenue, grew 22% and 21% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 28% and 26% in constant currency with continued growth across all workloads. Segment gross margin dollars increased 13% and gross margin percentage increased slightly year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly, 1 point, driven by improvements in Office 365. Operating expenses increased to 2% and operating income increased 20% and 19% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $24.3 billion, increasing 19% and ahead of expectations, with better-than-expected results across all businesses. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue grew 21%. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 29% and 28% in constant currency, including roughly 3 points from AI Services. While the trends from prior quarter continued, growth was ahead of expectations, primarily driven by increased GPU capacity and better-than-expected GPU utilization of our AI services, as well as slightly higher-than-expected growth in our per-user business. In our per user business, the enterprise mobility and security installed base, grew 11% to over 259 million seats with continued impact from the growth trends in new standalone business noted earlier. In our on-premises server business, revenue increased 2% ahead of expectations, driven primarily by demand in advance of Windows Server 2012 end of support. Enterprise and partner services revenue increased 1% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency ahead of expectations, driven by a better-than-expected performance in Enterprise Support Services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 20% and 19% in constant currency and gross margin percentage increased slightly. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points, driven by the improvement in Azure noted earlier, even as we scale our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. Operating expenses increased 2% and 1% in constant currency, operating income grew 31% and 30% in constant currency. Now to More Personal Computing, revenue was $13.7 billion, increasing 3% and 2% in constant currency, above expectations, with better-than-expected results across all businesses. Windows OEM revenue increased 4% year-over-year, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by stronger-than-expected consumer channel inventory builds and the stabilizing PC market demand noted earlier, particularly in commercial. Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 8%, driven by demand for Microsoft 365 E5. Devices revenue decreased 22%, ahead of expectations due to stronger execution in the commercial segment. Search and news advertising revenue, ex-TAC increased 10% and 9% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations. We saw increased engagement on Bing and Edge share gains again this quarter, although search revenue growth continues to be impacted by a third-party partnership. And in gaming, revenue increased 9% and 8% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected subscriber growth in Xbox Game Pass as well as first-party content, primarily due to the Starfield launch. Xbox content and services revenue increased 13% and 12% in constant currency and Xbox hardware revenue declined 7% and 8% in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars increased 13% and 12% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased roughly 5 points year-over-year, driven primarily by sales mix-shift to higher-margin businesses. Operating expenses declined 1% and operating income increased 23% and 22% in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases were $11.2 billion to support cloud demand, including investments to scale our AI infrastructure. Cash paid for PP&E was $9.9 billion. Cash flow from operations was $30.6 billion, up 32% year-over-year, driven by strong cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $20.7 billion, up 22% year-over-year. This quarter, other income and expense was $389 million, higher-than-anticipated, driven by interest income, partially offset by net losses on investments and foreign currency remeasurement. Our effective tax rate was approximately 18%. And finally, we returned $9.1 billion to shareholders, through share repurchases and dividends. Now moving to our Q2 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise is on a U.S. dollar basis. The Activision acquisition closed on October 13. So my commentary includes the net impact of the deal from the date of acquisition. Our outlook includes purchase accounting impact, integration, and transaction-related expenses based on our current understanding of the purchase price allocation and related deal accounting. The net impact includes adjusting for the movement of Activision content from our prior relationship as a third-party partner to first party. Now to FX. Based on current rates, we expect FX to increase total revenue and segment-level revenue growth by approximately 1 point. We expect FX to have no impact to COGS and operating expense growth. In commercial bookings, we expect consistent execution across our core annuity sales motions, including healthy renewals. The growth will be impacted by a low growth expiry base. Therefore, we expect bookings growth to be relatively flat. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage to be relatively flat year-over-year, excluding the impact from the accounting estimate change, Q2 Cloud gross margin percentage will be up roughly 1 point, primarily driven by improvement in Azure and Office 365, partially offset by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. We expect capital expenditures to increase sequentially on a dollar basis, driven by investments in our cloud and AI infrastructure. As a reminder, there can be normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure buildout. Next to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 11% and 12% or $18.8 billion to $19.1 billion. Growth in constant currency will be approximately 1 point lower. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be up roughly 16% in constant currency. We're excited for Microsoft 365 Copilot general availability on November 1st, and expect the related revenue to grow gradually over time. In our on-premise business, we expect revenue to decline in the mid-to-high teens. In Office Consumer, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single-digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single-digits, driven by Talent Solutions and Marketing Solutions. Growth continues to be impacted by the overall market environment for recruiting and advertising, especially in the technology industry, where we have significant exposure. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the high teens, driven by Dynamics 365. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 17% and 18% or $25.1 billion to $25.4 billion. Revenue growth in constant currency will be approximately 1 point lower. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which as a reminder can have quarterly variability, primarily from our per-user business and from in-period revenue recognition, depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect revenue growth to be 26% to 27% in constant currency, with an increasing contribution from AI. Growth continues to be driven by Azure consumption business and we expect the trends from Q1 to continue into Q2. Our per user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect continued moderation in seat growth rates, given the size of the installed base. For H2, assuming the optimization and new workload trends continue and with the growing contribution from AI, we expect Azure revenue growth in constant currency to remain roughly stable compared to Q2. And our on-premises server business, we expect revenue growth to be roughly flat with continued hybrid demand, particularly from licenses running in multi-cloud environments. And in enterprise and partner services, revenue should decline by low-to-mid single digits. Now to more Personal Computing, which includes the net impact from the Activision acquisition. We expect revenue of $16.5 billion to $16.9 billion. Windows OEM revenue growth should be mid-to-high single digits with PC market unit volumes expected to look roughly similar to Q1. In devices, revenue should decline in the mid-teens as we continue to focus on our higher-margin premium products. In Windows Commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive revenue growth in the low-to-mid teens. Search and news advertising ex-TAC revenue growth should be mid-single digits with roughly 4 points of negative impact from a third-party partnership. Growth should be driven by volume strength, supported by Edge browser share gains and increasing Bing engagement, as we expect the advertising spend environment to be similar to Q1. A reminder that this ex-TAC growth will be roughly 4 points higher than overall search and news advertising revenue. And in gaming, we expect revenue growth in the mid-to-high 40s. This includes roughly 35 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition, which as a reminder includes adjusting for the third-party to first-party content change noted earlier. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth in the mid-to-high 50s, driven by roughly 50 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS between $19.4 billion to $19.6 billion, including approximately $500 million of amortization of acquired intangible assets from the Activision acquisition. We expect operating expense of $15.5 billion to $15.6 billion, including approximately $400 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related cost from the Activision acquisition. Other income and expense should be roughly negative $500 million, as interest income will be more than offset by interest expense, primarily due to a reduction in our investment portfolio balance and the issuance of short-term debt, both for the Activision acquisition. As a reminder, we are required to recognize gains or losses on our equity investments, which can increase quarterly volatility. We expect our Q2 effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. Now, some additional thoughts on H2 as well as the full fiscal year. First, FX, assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to have no meaningful impact to full year revenue COGS or operating expense growth. Therefore, in H2, we expect FX to decrease revenue COGS and operating expense growth by 1 point. Second, Activision, we expect approximately $900 million for purchase accounting adjustments as well as integration and transaction-related costs in each quarter in H2. For a full FY '24, we remain committed to investing for the cloud and AI opportunity, while also maintaining our disciplined focus on operating leverage. Therefore, as we add the net impact of Activision, inclusive of purchase accounting adjustments as well as integration and transaction-related expenses, we continue to expect full year operating margins to remain flat year-over-year. In closing, with our strong start to FY '24, I am confident that as a team, we will continue to deliver healthy growth in the year ahead, driven by our leadership in commercial cloud and our commitment to lead the AI platform wave.

The pace of innovation you guys have been putting out has been pretty amazing. And the new products garnering traction probably faster than we've expected on our side of the equation. But we're also working in an overall spending environment, that remains volatile, and I think investors are getting more concerned on it. So two questions on this, one, based on sort of the new products and the innovation, do you think you guys can sustain the type of commercial growth that we saw in Q1 as we go through the year or is the environment too tricky for that? And then when it relates to investment, Amy, you've been able to keep overall OpEx growth very low, and it was very low this quarter. At some point, should we be thinking about a return to a more aggressive investment behind all this product innovation?",159.0,69.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07246376811594203,0.057971014492753624,0.028985507246376812,0.0,0.0,0.014492753623188406

Overall there are multiple things, Keith, they're all happening obviously simultaneously. If you just take Azure and try to characterize, where's the growth for Azure coming from or what sort of drivers for Azure numbers, there are three things all happening in parallel. Like, for example, take cloud migrations. A good reminder of where we are and even the core cloud migration story is the new Oracle announcement. Once we announced that the Oracle databases are going to be available on Azure, we saw a bunch of unlock from new customers who have significant Oracle estates that have not yet moved to the cloud because they needed to rendezvous with the rest of the app estate in one single cloud. And so we're excited about that. So in some sense, even the financial services sector, for example, is a good place where there's a lot of Oracle that still needs to move to the cloud. The second thing, of course, is the workloads start, then workloads get optimized, and then new workloads start, and that cycle continues. We'll lap some of those optimization cycles that were fairly extreme perhaps in the second half of our fiscal. And the third thing is, for us, that's unique and different is new workload starts around AI. Given our leadership position, we are seeing complete new projects start, which are AI projects. And as you know, AI projects are not just about AI meters, they have lots of other cloud meters as well. So that sort of gives you one side of what's happening in terms of enterprise. The other piece is on the SaaS side, obviously, again, this is a new product that's going to go through the enterprise adoption cycle. The results around productivity, which we demonstrated with GitHub Copilot, is what's giving us good confidence and our customers, more importantly, good confidence around what these products represent in terms of value. And so we are in the very early innings there, and so we look forward to seeing the traction for these products going forward.",365.0,171.0,6.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.03508771929824561,0.0,0.011695906432748537,0.0,0.0,0.03508771929824561

In general, we saw very consistent execution from Q4 to Q1, and that's what we're talking about into Q2. I think that speaks to our value prop, which is where Satya went. It speaks to making sure that customers are getting a very quick return on value, real productivity improvement, real savings, so that when we're asking at renewal or talking about E5 upgrades or talking about AI services, that those come with real promises of high-value scenarios. And so I think that is an important piece as you think about, stability and commercial demand. And then if you think about the nature of your question, it was partially why I talked about in my full-year guidance that, now, even with the addition of Activision and purchase accounting impacts, and integration impacts, we still feel confident we can deliver consistent operating margins to last year. And it speaks to, I think, some of the improvements, we're making in Azure and even in Microsoft 365 gross margins, even in the core of the commercial cloud. It speaks to the pace at which we are delivering AI revenue with the increasing cost expense and capital investment ahead with the demand we see. And, although you're right, our operating expense comparables in H2 get more challenging than in H1, we're really focused on making sure that every dollar we put and commit is back to the priorities we talked about, which is commercial cloud leadership and leading the AI wave. And so I think that focus is really helping on both execution and leverage.",296.0,135.0,6.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.044444444444444446,0.022222222222222223,0.007407407407407408,0.0,0.007407407407407408,0.022222222222222223

Yeah, it is true that we have -- the approach we have taken is a full stack approach all the way from whether it's ChatGPT or Bing Chat or all our Copilots, all share the same model. So in some sense, one of the things that we do have is very, very high leverage of the one model that we used -- which we trained, and then the one model that we are doing inferencing at scale. And that advantage sort of trickles down all the way to both utilization internally, utilization of third parties, and also over time, you can see the sort of stack optimization all the way to the silicon because the abstraction layer to which the developers are riding is much higher up than low-level kernels if you will. So, therefore, I think there is a fundamental approach we took, which was a technical approach of saying we'll have Copilots and Copilot stack all available. That doesn't mean we don't have people doing training for open source models or proprietary models. We also have a bunch of open source models. We have a bunch of fine-tuning happening, a bunch of RLHF happening. So there's all kinds of ways people use it. But the thing is, we have scale leverage of one large model that was trained and one large model that's being used for inference across all our first-party SaaS apps, as well as our API in our Azure AI service…",259.0,109.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.009174311926605505,0.009174311926605505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The question, Ramo, the good news is two-fold, one is the fact that, what is 40% of the Fortune 100 are already in the preview and are using the product and I think you all have also done lots of checks and the feedback is very, very positive. And, in fact, the interesting thing is, it's not any one tool, right? Which is the feedback even sort of is very clear that it's the all up. You just keep hitting the Copilot button across every surface, right, whether it's in Word to create documents, in Excel to, do analysis, or PowerPoint or Outlook or Teams just like that. Clearly, the Teams meeting, which is an intelligent recap, it's not just a dumb transcript. It's like having a knowledge base of all your meetings that you can query and add to essentially the knowledge terms of your enterprise. And so we are seeing broad usage across and the interesting thing is, by different functions, whether it's in finance or in sales by roles, we are seeing productivity gains like we saw with developers and GitHub Copilot.

And of course, this is an enterprise product, I mean, at the end of the day, we are grounded on enterprise cycle times in terms of adoption and ramp, and it's incrementally priced, so, therefore that all will apply still.

Why wouldn't it accelerate in the -- in the second half of your fiscal year, if the AI contribution is increasing as you bring on more GPU capacity?

We've been very consistent that the optimization trends have been consistent for us through a couple of quarters now. Customers are going to continue to do that. It's an important part of running workloads that is not new. There obviously were some quarters where it was more accelerated, but that is a pattern that is and has been a fundamental part of having customers, both make new room for new workload adoption and continue to build new capabilities. And so I think that impact remains through the rest of the year, and my view is unchanged on that. And then of course, I think the key component has always been new workload starts. And at the scale we're talking about, being able to have stability in our Azure business, does mean that we will have a lot of new workload starts.

And that has been, I would say, looking back a number of quarters where the majority of our seat growth has gone.

I think there are a couple things going on and I do -- I would say in particular, this was a very good leverage quarter in that segment. Number one, the Azure revenue growth and the stability we're seeing in it, absolutely is that help the operating leverage. The second component of that is in our core Azure business. The team continues to deliver thoughtful gross margin improvement across both technical decisions, software implementations. Our teams on the infrastructure build side have done really good work to deliver that, and so that's been helpful as well. And then, of course, on operating expenses, there's been a good focus on continuing even within that segment, to make sure we're focusing that work on leading in the AI transition with Azure. And so you're right, even as we're investing in AI infrastructure, which will and should show up as revenue, it'll also show up in COGS and still deliver good margin.

On our core business, the core Azure business, the core Office 365, M365 business, Dynamics business, they're -- they continue to deliver gross margin year-over-year improvements in the core. And so that, like in other quarters has helped this quarter. In addition, what Satya mentioned earlier in a question, and I just want to take every chance to reiterate it, if you have a consistent infrastructure from the platform all the way up through its layers, then every capital dollar we spend, if we optimize revenue against it, we will have great leverage, because wherever demand shows up in the layers, whether it's at the SaaS layer, whether it's at the infrastructure layer, whether it's for training workloads, we're able to quickly put our infrastructure to work generating revenue, or on our Bing workloads. I mean, I should have mentioned all the consumer workloads use the same frame. And so when you think about our investment in AI, yes, it will -- because we're committed to leading this wave and see demand, you will see that impact in COGS growth. But what we're committed to doing is making sure it's highly leveraged and making sure you see the same growth in revenue. And I think on occasion, you may see something pick up 1 or 2 points and the other one not quite get there, but the point is, it's going to be very well paired because of the choices we've made over the past, frankly, numerous years, to get to a point where that infrastructure is consistent.",286.0,134.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.029850746268656716,0.029850746268656716,0.007462686567164179,0.0,0.014925373134328358,0.0

MSFT,2024-01-30,2024-01-31,,2024-01-30,2024-01-30T17:30:00-05:00,0,2024-01-30,prepared,,Satya Nadella,"Thank you, Brett. It was a record quarter driven by the continued strength of Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $33 billion in revenue, up 24%. We’ve moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale by infusing AI across every layer of our tech stack, we are winning new customers and helping drive new benefits and productivity gains. Now I'll highlight examples of our momentum and progress starting with Azure. Azure again took share this quarter with our AI advantage. Azure offers the top performance for AI training and inference in the most diverse selection of AI accelerators, including the latest from AMD and NVIDIA, as well as our own first-party silicon Azure Maia. And with Azure AI, we provide access to the best selection of foundation and open-source models, including both LLM and SLMs, all integrated deeply with infrastructure, data, and tools on Azure. We now have 53,000 Azure AI customers, over one-third are new to Azure over the past 12 months. Our new models of service offering makes it easy for developers to use LLM's from our partners like Cohere, Meta, and Mistral on Azure, without having to manage underlying infrastructure. We have also built the world's most popular SLMs, which offer performance comparable to larger models, but are small enough to run on a laptop or mobile device. Anker, Ashley, AT&T, EY, and Thomson Reuters, for example, are all already exploring how to use our SLM-5 for their applications. And we have great momentum with Azure OpenAI Service. This quarter we added support for OpenAI's latest models including GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4 with Vision, DALL-E 3 as well as fine-tuning. We are seeing increased usage from AI-first start-ups like Moveworks, Perplexity, SymphonyAI, as well as some of the world's largest companies. Over half of the Fortune 500 use Azure OpenAI today including Ally Financial, Coca-Cola, and Rockwell Automation. For example, at CES this month, Walmart shared how it's using Azure OpenAI Service along with its own proprietary data and models to streamline how more than 50,000 associates work and transform how it's millions of customers’ shop. More broadly, customers continue to choose Azure to simplify and accelerate their cloud migrations. Overall, we are seeing larger and more strategic Azure deals with an increase in the number of $1 billion-plus Azure commitments. Vodafone, for example, will invest $1.5 billion in Cloud and AI services over the next 10 years as it works to transform the digital experience of more than 300 million customers worldwide. Now on to data. We are integrating the power of AI across the entire data stack. Our Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform brings together operational databases, analytics, governance, and AI to help organizations simplify and consolidate their data estates. Cosmos DB is the go-to database to build AI-powered apps at any scale powering workloads for companies in every industry from AXA and Kohl's to Mitsubishi and TomTom. KPMG, for example, has used Cosmos DB including its built-in native vector search capabilities along with Azure OpenAI service to power an AI assistant, which it credits with driving an up to 50% increase in productivity for its consultants. All-up, Cosmos DB data transactions increased 42% year-over-year and for those organizations who want to go beyond in-database vector search, Azure AI search offers the best hybrid search solution. OpenAI is using it for retrieval augmented generation as part of ChatGPT. And this quarter, we made Microsoft Fabric generally available, helping customers like Milliman and PwC go from data to insights to action, all within the same unified SaaS solution. Data stored in Fabric's multi-cloud data lake, OneLake increased 46% quarter-over-quarter. Now on to developers. From GitHub to Visual Studio, we have the most comprehensive and loved developer tools for the era of AI. GitHub revenue accelerated to over 40% year-over-year, driven by all-up platform growth and adoption of GitHub Copilot, the world's most widely deployed AI developer tool. We now have over 1.3 million paid GitHub copilot subscribers, up 30% quarter-over-quarter, and more than 50,000 organizations use GitHub Copilot business to supercharge the productivity of their developers from digital natives like Etsy and HelloFresh to leading enterprises like Autodesk, Dell Technologies, and Goldman Sachs. Accenture alone will rollout GitHub Copilot to 50,000 of its developers this year and we're going further making copilot ubiquitous across the entire GitHub platform and new AI-powered security features, as well as Copilot enterprise, which tailors Copilot to organization's code bases and allows developers to converse with it in natural language. We're also the leader in low-code no-code development helping everyone create apps, automate workflows, analyze data, and now build custom copilots. More than 230,000 organizations have already used AI capabilities in Power Platform, up over 80% quarter-over-quarter, and with Copilot Studio, organizations can tailor Copilot for Microsoft 365 or create their own custom copilots. It is already being used by over 10,000 organizations including An Post, Holland America, PG&E. In just weeks, for example, both PayPal and Tata Digital built copilots to answer common employee queries, increasing productivity and reducing support costs. We're also using this AI moment to redefine our role in business applications. Dynamics 365 once again took share as organizations use our AI-powered apps to transform their marketing, sales, service, finance, and supply-chain functions. And we are expanding our TAM by integrating Copilot into third-party systems too. In sales out Copilot has helped sellers at more than 30,000 organizations including Lumen Technologies and Schneider Electric to enrich their customer interactions using data from Dynamics 365 or Salesforce. And with our new Copilot for service employees at companies like Northern Trust can resolve client queries faster. It includes out-of-the-box integrations to apps like Salesforce, ServiceNow, and Zendesk. With our industry and cross-industry clouds, we're tailoring our solutions to meet the needs of specific industries. In healthcare, DAX Copilot is being used by more than 100 healthcare systems including Lifespan, UNC Health and UPMC to increase physician productivity and reduce burnout. And our Cloud for Retail was front and center at NRF with retailers from Canadian Tire Corporation, to Leatherman and Ralph Lauren sharing how they will use our solutions across the shopper journey to accelerate time to value. Now on to future of work. A growing body of evidence makes clear the role AI will play in transforming work. Our own research as well as external studies show as much as 70% improvement in productivity, using generative AI for specific work tasks. And overall early Copilot for Microsoft 365 users were 29% faster in a series of tasks like searching, writing, and summarizing. Two months in, we have seen faster adoption than either our E3 or E5 suites as enterprises like Dentsu, Honda, Pfizer, all deploy Copilot to their employees. And we are expanding availability to organizations of all sizes. We're also seeing a Copilot ecosystem begin to emerge. ISVs like Atlassian, Mural, and Trello, as well as customers like Air India, Bayer, and Siemens have all built plug-ins for specific lines of business that extend Copilot's capabilities. When it comes to Teams, we again saw record usage as organizations brought together collaboration chat, meetings, and calling on one platform and Teams has also become a new entry point for us. More than two-thirds of our enterprise Teams customers buy Phone, Rooms or Premium. All this innovation is driving growth across Microsoft 365. We now have more than 400 million paid Office 365 seats and organizations like BP, Elanco, ING Bank, Mediaset, WTW, all chose E5 this quarter to empower their employees with our best-in-class productivity apps along with advanced security compliance, voice, and analytics. Now on to Windows. In 2024, AI will become a first-class part of every PC. Windows PCs with built-in neural processing units were front and center at CES, unlocking new AI experiences to make what you do on your PC easier and faster from searching for answers and summarizing emails to optimizing performance and battery efficiency. Copilot in Windows is already available on more than 75 million Windows 10 and Windows 11 PCs and with our new Copilot key, the first significant change to the Windows keyboard in 30 years, we're providing one-click access. We also continue to transform how Windows is experienced and managed with Azure Virtual Desktop and Windows 365, introducing new features that make it simpler for employees to access and IT teams to secure their cloud PCs. Usage of cloud-delivered Windows increased over 50% year-over-year. And all-up, Windows 11 commercial deployments increased 2 times year-over-year as companies like HPE and Petrobras rolled out operating systems to employees. Now onto security. The recent security attacks, including the nation-state attack on our corporate systems, we reported a week and a half ago have highlighted the urgent need for organizations to move even faster to protect themselves from cyber threats. It's why last fall we announced a set of engineering priorities under our secure future initiative, bringing together every part of the company to advance cyber security protection across both new products and legacy infrastructure. And it's why we continue to innovate across our security portfolio as well as our operational security posture to help customers adopt a Zero Trust security architecture. Our industry-first unified security operations platform brings together our SIM Microsoft Sentinel, our XDR Microsoft Defender, and Copilot for security to help teams manage an increasingly complex security landscape. And with Copilot for security, we're now helping hundreds of early access customers including Cmax, Dow, LTI Mindtree, McAfee, Nucor Steel, significantly increase their SecOps team's productivity. This quarter, we extended copilot to Entra, Intune, and Purview. All-up, we have over 1 million customers, including more than 700,000 who use four or more of our security products like Arrow Electronics, DXC Technology, Freeport-McMoRan, Insight Enterprises, JB Hunt, and the Mosaic Company. Now on to LinkedIn. LinkedIn is now helping over 1 billion members learn, sell, and get hired. We continue to see strong global membership growth driven by member sign-ups in key markets like Germany and India. In an ever-changing job market, members are staying competitive through skill-building and knowledge-sharing. Over the last 12 months, members have added 680 million skills to their profiles, up 80% year-over-year. Our new AI-powered features are transforming the LinkedIn member experience, everything from how people learn new skills to how they search for jobs and engage with [indiscernible]. New AI features, including more personalized emails also continue to increase business ROI on the platform and our hiring business took share for the sixth consecutive quarter. And more broadly, AI is transforming our search and browser experience. We are encouraged by the momentum, earlier this month, we achieved a new milestone with 5 billion images created and 5 billion chats conducted to-date, both doubling quarter-over-quarter and both being an edge took share this quarter. We also introduced Copilot as a standalone destination across all browsers and devices, as well as a Copilot app on iOS and Android. And just two weeks ago, we introduced Copilot Pro providing access to the latest models for quick answers and high-quality image creation and access to Copilot for Microsoft 365 personal and family subscribers. Now on to gaming. This quarter we set all-time records for monthly active users in Xbox PC, as well as mobile, where we now have over 200 million monthly active users alone, inclusive of Activision Blizzard King. With our acquisition, we have added hundreds of millions of gamers to our ecosystem, as we execute on our ambition to reach more gamers on more platforms. With cloud gaming, we continue to innovate to offer players more ways to experience the games they love where and when and how they want, hours streamed increased 44% year-over-year. Great content is key to our growth and across our portfolio, I've never been more excited about our line-up of upcoming games. Earlier this month, we shared exciting new first-party titles coming this year to Xbox PC and Game Pass including Indiana Jones. And we've also announced launching significant updates this calendar year to many of our most durable franchises, which brings in millions of players each month, including Call of Duty, Elder Scrolls Online, and Starfield. In closing, we are looking forward to how AI-driven transformation will benefit people and organizations in 2024. With that, I'll hand it over to Amy.",2091.0,1102.0,26.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,10.0,0.0,3.0,0.023593466424682397,0.0018148820326678765,0.0,0.0,0.0009074410163339383,0.021778584392014518

This quarter, revenue was $62 billion, up 18% and 16% in constant currency. When adjusted for the prior year's Q2 charge, operating income increased 25% and 23% in constant currency, and earnings per share was $2.93, which increased 26% and 23% in constant currency. Results exceeded expectations and we delivered another quarter of double-digit top and bottom-line growth. Strong execution by our sales teams and partners drove share gains again this quarter across many of our businesses, as Satya referenced. In our commercial business, strong demand for our Microsoft cloud offerings, including AI services drove better-than-expected growth and large long-term Azure contracts. Microsoft 365 suite strength contributed to ARPU expansion for our office commercial business, while new business growth continued to be moderated for standalone products sold outside the Microsoft 365 suite. Commercial bookings were ahead of expectations and increased 17% and 9% in constant currency on a low expiry base. The strength in long-term Azure contracts mentioned earlier, along with strong execution across our core annuity sales motions, including healthy renewals drove our results. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 17% and 16% in constant currency to $222 billion, roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 15% year-over-year. The remaining portion recognized beyond the next 12 months increased 19%. And this quarter, our annuity mix was 96%. In our consumer business, the PC and advertising markets were generally in line with our expectations. PC market volumes continued to stabilize at pre-pandemic levels [Technical Difficulty] Gaming console market was a bit smaller. As a reminder, my Q2 commentary includes the net impact of Activision from the date of acquisition, inclusive of purchase accounting, integration, and transaction-related expenses. The net impact includes adjusting for the movement of Activision content from our prior relationship as a third-party partner to first-party. At a company level, Activision contributed approximately 4 points to revenue growth, was a 2 point drag on adjusted operating income growth, and a negative $0.5 impact to earnings per share. This impact includes $1.1 billion from purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related costs, such as severance-related charges related to last week's announcement. FX was roughly in line with our expectations on total company revenue, segment-level revenue, COGS, and operating expense growth. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $33.7 billion, ahead of expectations, and grew 24% and 22% in constant currency. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage was 72%, relatively unchanged year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point, driven by improvement in Azure and Office 365, partially offset by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. Company gross margin dollars increased 20% and 18% in constant-currency and gross margin percentage increased year-over-year to 68%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points, even with the impact of $581 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration, and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Growth was driven by improvement in devices, as well as the improvement in Azure and Office 365 as just mentioned. Operating expenses increased 3% with 11 points from the Activision acquisition, partially offset by 7 points of favorable impact from the prior year Q2 charge. The Activision impact includes $550 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration, and transaction-related cost. At a company level, headcount at the end of December was 2% lower than a year ago. Operating margins increased roughly 5 points year-over-year to 44%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins increased roughly 6 points driven by the higher gross margin noted earlier, the favorable impact from the prior year Q2 charge, and improved operating leverage through disciplined cost control. Now, to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $19.2 billion and grew 13% and 12% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, primarily driven by better-than-expected results in LinkedIn. Office commercial revenue grew 15% and 13% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 17% and 16% in constant currency, in line with expectations, driven by healthy renewal execution and ARPU growth from continued E5 momentum. Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 9% year-over-year to over $400 million with installed base expansion across all customer segments. Seat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings, offset by the continued growth trends in new standalone business noted earlier. Office commercial licensing declined 17% and 18% in constant currency with continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Office Consumer revenue increased 5% and 4% in constant currency with continued momentum in Microsoft 355 subscriptions, which grew 16% to 78.4 million. LinkedIn revenue increased 9% and 8% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by slightly better-than-expected performance across all businesses. In our Talent Solutions business bookings growth was again impacted by weaker hiring environment in key verticals. Dynamics revenue grew 21% and 19% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 27% and 24% in constant currency with continued growth across all workloads. Bookings growth was impacted by weaker new business, primarily in Dynamics 365 ERP and CRM workloads. Segment gross margin dollars increased 14% and 12% in constant currency and gross margin percentage increased slightly year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point, primarily driven by improvement in Office 365. Operating expenses decreased 5% and 6% in constant currency, with 5 points of favorable impact from the prior-year Q2 charge. Operating income increased 26% and 24% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment, revenue was $25.9 billion, increasing 20% and 19% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, with better-than-expected results across all businesses. Overall server products and cloud services revenue grew 22% and 20% in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 30% and 28% in constant-currency, including 6 points of growth from AI services. Both AI and non-AI Azure services drove our outperformance. In our per-user business, the Enterprise Mobility and Security installed base grew 11% to over 268 million seats with continued impact from the growth trends in new standalone business noted earlier. In our on-premises server business, revenue increased 3% and 2% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven primarily by the better-than-expected demand related to Windows Server 2012 end of support. Enterprise and partner services revenue increased 1% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency with better-than-expected performance across enterprise support services and industry solutions. Segment gross margin dollars increased 20% and 18% in constant currency and gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point, driven by the improvement in Azure noted earlier, partially offset by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. Operating expenses decreased 8% and 9% in constant currency, with 9 points of favorable impact from the prior year Q2 charge, operating income grew 40% and 37% in constant currency. Now, to more Personal Computing. Revenue was $16.9 billion, increasing 19% and 18% in constant currency, in line with expectations overall. Growth includes 15 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Windows OEM revenue increased 11% year-over-year, ahead of expectations, driven by slightly better performance and higher monetizing consumer markets. Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 9% and 7% in constant-currency, below expectations primarily [Technical Difficulty] period revenue recognition from the mix of contracts. Annuity billings growth remains healthy. Devices revenue decreased 9% and 10% in constant currency, ahead of expectations due to stronger execution in the commercial segment. Search and news advertising revenue ex-TAC increased 8% and 7% in constant currency, relatively in line with expectations, driven by higher search volume, offset by negative impact from a third-party partnership. And in gaming, revenue increased 49% and 48% in constant currency, with 44 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Total gaming revenue was in line with expectations of stronger-than-expected performance from Activision was offset by the weaker-than-expected console market noted earlier. Xbox content and services revenue increased 61% and 60% in constant currency, driven by 55 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Xbox hardware revenue grew 3% and 1% in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars increased 34% and 32% in constant currency with 17 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Gross margin percentage increased roughly 6 points year-over-year, driven by higher devices gross margin and sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 38% with 48 points of impact from the Activision acquisition, partially offset by 6 points of favorable impact from the prior year Q2 charge. Operating income increased 29% and 26% in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases were $11.5 billion, lower-than-expected due to delivery for a third-party capacity contract shifting from Q2 to Q3. Cash paid-for PP&E was $9.7 billion. These data center investments support our cloud demand, inclusive of needs to scale our AI infrastructure. Cash flow from operations was $18.9 billion, up 69% driven by strong cloud billings and collections on a prior year comparable that was impacted by lower operating income. Free cash flow was $9.1 billion, up 86% year-over-year, reflecting the timing of cash paid-for property and equipment. This quarter, other income and expense was in line with expectations, negative $506 million, driven by interest expense and net losses on investments, partially offset by interest income. Our effective tax rate was approximately 18%. And finally, we returned $8.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Now moving to our Q3 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise is on a US dollar basis. First FX, based on current rates, we expect FX to increase total revenue and segment-level revenue growth by less than 1 point. And we expect no impact to COGS and operating expense growth. In commercial bookings, strong execution across our core annuity sales motions, including healthy renewals along with long-term Azure commitments should drive healthy growth on a growing expiry base. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should decrease roughly 1 point year-over-year, excluding the impact from the accounting estimate change, Q3 cloud gross margin percentage will be relatively flat as improvement in Office 365 and Azure will be offset by sales mix shift to Azure, as well as the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. We expect capital expenditures to increase materially on a sequential basis, driven by investments in our cloud and AI infrastructure and the flip of a delivery date from Q2 to Q3 from a third-party provider noted earlier. As a reminder, there can be normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure build-out. Next to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue of $19.3 billion to $19.6 billion or growth between 10% and 12%. In Office Commercial revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be approximately 15% in constant currency. While it's early days for Microsoft 365 Copilot, we're excited by the adoption we've seen to date and continue to expect revenue to grow over time. In our on-premise business, we expect revenue to decline in the low 20s. In Office Consumer, we expect revenue growth in the mid-to-high single-digits, driven by Microsoft's 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the mid-to-high single digits, driven by continued growth across all businesses. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the mid-teens, driven by Dynamics 365. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue of $26 billion to $26.3 billion or growth between 18% and 19%. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability, primarily from our per-user business and from in-period revenue recognition, depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q3 revenue growth in constant currency to remain stable to our stronger-than-expected Q2 results. Growth will be driven by our Azure consumption business with continued strong contribution from AI. Our per-user business should see benefit from Microsoft 365 Suite momentum though we expect continued moderation in seat growth rates given the size of the installed base. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue growth in the low-to-mid single-digits with continued hybrid demand, including licenses running in multi-cloud environments. And in the enterprise and partner services revenue should decline approximately 10% on a high prior year comparable for enterprise support services and more Personal Computing, we expect revenue of $14.7 billion, $15.1 billion or growth between 11% and 14%. Windows OEM revenue growth should be relatively flat as PC market unit volumes continue at pre-pandemic levels. In Windows Commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our Advanced Security Solutions should drive revenue growth in the mid-teens. As a reminder, our quarterly revenue growth can have variability, primarily from in-period revenue recognition, depending on the mix of contracts. In Devices, revenue should decline in the low-double-digits as we continue to focus on our higher-margin premium products. Search and news advertising ex-TAC revenue growth should be in the mid-to-high single-digits, about 8 points higher than overall search and news advertising revenue, driven by continued volume strength. And in gaming, we expect revenue growth in the low 40s, including approximately 45 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth in the low-to-mid 50s, driven by approximately 50 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Hardware revenue will decline year-over-year. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS between $18.6 billion to $18.8 billion, including approximately $700 million of amortization of acquired intangible assets from the Activision acquisition. We expect operating expenses of $15.8 billion to $15.9 billion, including approximately $300 million from purchase accounting, integration, and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Other income and expenses should be roughly negative $600 million as interest income will be more than offset by interest expense and other losses. As a reminder, we are required to recognize gains or losses on our equity investments, which can increase quarterly volatility. We expect our Q3 effective tax rate to be in line with our full-year rate, which we now expect to be approximately 18%. Now, some additional thoughts on the full-fiscal year. First FX, assuming current rates remain stable, we now expect FX to increase Q4 and full-year revenue growth by less than 1 point. We continue to expect no meaningful impact to full-year COGS or operating expense growth. Second Activision. For the full-year FY 2024, we expect Activision to be accretive to operating income, when excluding purchase accounting, integration and transaction-related cost. At a total company level, we delivered strong results in H1 and demand for our Microsoft Cloud continues to drive the growth in our outlook for H2. Our commitment to scaling our cloud and AI investment is guided by customer demand and a substantial market opportunity. As we scale these investments, we remain focused on driving efficiencies across every layer of our tech stack and disciplined cost management across every team. Therefore, we expect full-year operating margins to be up 1 to 2 points year-over-year, even as AI capital investments drive COGS growth. This operating margin expansion excludes the impact from the Activision acquisition and the headwind from the change in useful lives last year. In closing, we are focused on execution. So our customers can realize the benefits of AI productivity gains as we invest to lead this AI platform wave.

Amy, you've discussed Azure being stable and you deliver Azure growth stability, but if we drill in one layer, we see Azure AI [aiming] (ph) to become a bigger portion of the revenue. I understand that separating what is directly AI revenue versus other IaaS, PaaS revenue that are leveraging well driven by AI is difficult, can you help me with two related questions? Optimization has been stabilizing and at some point, it should be part of the revenue flow. How should we think about what happens then, do we see non-directly AI consumption being flattish or do we see a rebound as the cloud shift continues and the need for data of inferencing grows? Second point. On AI, where are we in the journey from training driving most of Azure AI usage to inferencing? When do you think we start to see pick-up in non-Microsoft inferencing kick in, when do you think we could hit the point where inferencing is the bigger part of the driver?

So, none of the large model training stuff is in any of our higher numbers at all. What small batch training, so somebody is doing fine-tuning or what have you, that will be there, but that's sort of a minor part. So, most of what you see in the Azure number is broadly inferencing. And Mark, I think it may be helpful to sort of think about, like what is the new workload in AI? The new workload in AI, obviously, in our case starts with one of the frontier -- I mean, starts with the Frontier model Azure OpenAI. But it's not just about just one model, right. So, you first -- you take that model, you do RLHF, you may do some fine-tuning, you do retrieval, which means you are sort of either heating some storage meter or you're heating some compute meters. And so to -- and by the way, you will also distil a large model to a small model and that would be a training perhaps. But that's a small batch training that uses essentially inference infrastructure. So, I think that's what's happening. So you could even say these AI workloads themselves will have a lifecycle which is they'll get rebuilt, then there'll be continuously optimized over time. So, that's sort of one-side. And I think if I understand your question, what's happening with the traditional optimization, and I think last quarter we said. One, we're going to continue to have these cycles where people will build new workloads, they will optimize the workloads and then they'll start new workloads. So I think that that's what we continue to see. But that period of massive, I'll call it, optimization only and no new workloads start, that I think has ended at this point. So what you're seeing is much more of that continuous cycles by customers, both whether it comes to AI or whether it comes to the traditional workloads.",362.0,152.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.006578947368421052,0.02631578947368421,0.0,0.0,-0.006578947368421052

I think whether you use the word lapping, these optimization comparables or the comparables easing, is all sort of the same thing, that we're getting to that point, in H2 that's absolutely true. We'd like to talk about the contribution of AI specifically for the reason Satya talked about, these are -- this is starting to see the application of AI at scale. And we want to be able to show people, this is how that point will work, it's inferencing workloads where people are expecting productivity gains, other benefits that grow revenue and so, I do think about those as both related.

Amy, the margin improvement is pretty shocking to most considering the investments that you and Satya are putting into AI.

The teams are obviously been hard at work on this topic. We do point out that, Q2 because of the impact of the charge a year ago, you're seeing larger margin improvement than I would say, sort of a run-rate margin improvement. So, let me first say that. Secondly, the absolute margin improvement has also been very good and it speaks to, I think one of the things Satya talked about and I reiterated a bit, which is that, we want really to make sure we're making investments, we're making them in consistency across the tech stack. The tech stack we're building, no matter what team is on, is inclusive of AI enablement. And so think about as building that consistency without needing to add a lot of resources to do that. It's been a real pivot of our entire investment infrastructure to be working on this work. And I think that's important, because it means you're shifting to an AI-first position, not just in the language we use, but in what people are working on day-to-day. That does obviously create a leverage opportunity. There has also been really good work put in by many teams on improving the gross margin of the products; we talked about it with Office 365, we talked about in Azure core. We even talked about it across our devices portfolio, where we've seen material improvements over the course of the year. And so, when you kind of take improvements at the gross margin level, plus this consistency of re-pivoting our workforce toward the AI-first work we're doing, without adding material number of people to the workforce, you end up with that type of leverage. And we still need to be investing. And so, the important part, invest towards the thing that's going to shape the next decade and continue to stay focused on being able to deliver your day-to-day commitments. And so it's a great question. And hopefully, that helps piece apart a few of the components.",360.0,172.0,10.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05813953488372093,0.011627906976744186,0.0,0.0,0.005813953488372093,0.046511627906976744

In fact, you could say the core compute architecture itself changes, everything from power, power density to the data center design, to what used to be the accelerator, now is the sort of the main CPU, so to speak, or the main compute unit. And so, I think in the network, the memory architecture, all of it. So as the core computer architecture changes, I think every workload changes. And so yes, so there is a full, like, take our data layer, the most exciting thing for me in the last year has been to see how our data layer has evolved to be built for AI, right? If you think about Fabric, one of the genius of Fabric is to be able to say, let's separate out storage from the compute layer. In compute we'll have traditional SQL, we’ll have Spark. And by the way, you can have an Azure AI job on top of the same data lake, so to speak, or the lakehouse pattern. And then the business model you can combine all of those different compute. So that's the type of compute architecture. So it's sort of a -- so that's just one example. The tool stuff is changing. Office, I mean if you think about what -- if I look at Copilot; Copilots extensibility with GPT, Copilot apps to the Copilot stack, that's another sort of part of what's happening to the tech stack. So yes, I mean, definitely builds. I mean. I do believe, being in the cloud has been very helpful to build AI.

In my comments I said increase in relation to our previous suites like, let's say, E3 or E5. Whatever two months in, it's definitely much faster than that. And so, from that perspective. It's exciting to see, I’d say, the demand signal, the deployment signal. I was looking at by tenant, even usage, it's faster than anything else because it's easier, right. I mean, it's sort of -- it shows up in your app, if you click on it, like any ribbon thing and it becomes a daily habit. So it in fact, it reminds me a little bit of sort of the back-in-the day of PC adoption, right. It's kind of -- I think it first starts off with few people having access. There are many companies that are doing standard issue, right. So just like PCs became standard issue at some point after PCs being adopted by early adopters. I think that's the cycle that at least we expect. In terms of what we're seeing, it's actually interesting, If you look at the data we have, summarization, that's what it's like number-one, like I'm doing summarization of Teams meetings inside of Teams, during the meeting, after the meeting, word documents summarization, I get something in email on summarizing. So summarization has become a big deal. Drafts, right, you're drafting emails, drafting documents. So, anytime you want to start something, the blank page thing goes away and you start by prompting and drafting. Chat, to me, the most powerful feature is now you have the most important database in your company, which happens to be the database of your documents and communications. It is now queryable by natural language in a powerful way, right. I can go and say, what are all the things Amy said, I should be watching out for next quarter and it will come out with great detail. And so Chat, summarization, draft, also by the way, actions. One of the most used thing is, here's the Word document, go complete, I mean, create a PowerPoint for me. So, those are the stuff that is also beginning. So, I feel like these all become -- but fundamentally, what happens is, if you remember the PC adoption cycle, what it did was work artifact and work flow changed, right. You can imagine what forecasting was before excel and email and what it was after. So similarly, you'll see work and workflow change as people summarize faster, draft regulatory submissions faster. Chat to get knowledge from your business.

One of the exciting things as I said for some companies, it's going to be standard issue like PC, for other companies, they may want to do a land with a smaller group, see the productivity gains and then expand. And so being able to lift some of the seat requirements that we did earlier this month, it's really going to allow customers to be able to use that approach too. And the other thing I would add, we always talk about in enterprise software, you sell software, then you wait and then it gets deployed, and then after deployment, you want to see usage. And in particular, what we've seen and you would expect this, in some ways with Copilot even in the early stages, obviously, deployment happens very quickly.

And then we can come back to whether they should equalize or just go on sort of a bit, actually believe it or not, somewhat independent trajectory and I will explain why I say that. Your seat growth as we talk about is primarily from, at this point, small and medium-size businesses and really frontline workers scenarios. And to your point on occasion, those are lower ARPU seats, but there are also -- there are new seats and so you see that in the seat count number. And as we get through and we've seen that come down a little bit quarter-over-quarter and we've guided for that really to happen again next quarter, but a very separate thing is being able to add ARPU. And traditionally, and again this quarter, right, that's come over-time from E3. Then from E5. And we're continuing to see very healthy seat momentum and you heard very good renewals. So, all of that, right, completely independent in some way from seat growth. Then the next thing, that actually we just talked about, maybe in Brad's question I'm trying to recall is that, you're going to see Copilot revenue will run there as ARPU, right. That won't show a seat growth. So you'll have E3, E5 transition, Copilot, all show-up in ARPU over time, and then you’ll have the seat growth be primarily still small business and frontline worker and maybe new industry scenarios. So, I tend to not really, Brad, think about them as related lines, believe it or not.

I mean -- it's -- I always go back to sort of my own conviction that this generation of AI is going to be different, started with the move from 2.5 to 3 of GPT. And then it's use inside of developer scenario with GitHub copilot and so yes. I think this is the place where it's most evolved. In terms of its economic benefits or productivity benefits and you see it. We see it inside of Microsoft, we see it in all of the key studies we put out of customers, everybody had talked to its pick-up, but it is the one place where it's becoming standard issue for any developer is like if you takeaways spell check from Word, I'll be unemployable. And similarly, it will be like -- I think GitHub Copilot becomes core to anybody who is doing software development. The thing that you brought up is a little bit of a continuation to how Amy talked about, right. So you are going to start seeing people think of these tools as productivity enhancers, right. I mean, if I look at it, our ARPUs have been great, but they're pretty low.. You know even though we've had a lot of success, it's not like we had a high-priced ARPU company. I think what you're going to start finding is, whether it's sales copilot or service copilot or GitHub Copilot of security copilot. They are going to fundamentally capture some of the value they drive in terms of the productivity of the OpEx, right. So it's like 2 points, 3 points of OpEx leverage would be goal is on software spend. I think that's a pretty straightforward value equation. And so that's the first time, I mean this is not something we've been able to make the case for before whereas now I think we have that case. Then even the horizontal copilot is what Amy was talking about, which is at the Office 365 or Microsoft 365 level, even there, you can make the same argument whatever ARPU we may even have with E5, now, you can see incrementally as a percentage of the OpEx, how much would you pay for a copilot to give you more time savings for example. And so yes, I think all up, I do see this as a new vector for us in what I'll call the next phase of knowledge work and frontline work even in their productivity and how we participate. And I think GitHub copilot, I never thought of the tools business as fundamentally participating in the operating expenses of a company's spend on, let's say, development activity and now you're seeing that transition, it is just not tools, it's about productivity of your dev team.",472.0,195.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.010256410256410256,0.010256410256410256,0.005128205128205128,0.015384615384615385,0.0,0.0

MSFT,2024-04-25,2024-04-26,,2024-04-25,2024-04-25T17:30:00-04:00,0,2024-04-25,prepared,,Satya Nadella,"Thank you, Brett. It was a record third quarter, powered by the continued strength of the Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $35 billion in revenue, up 23%. Microsoft Copilot and Copilot stack, spanning everyday productivity, business process, and developer services, to models, data, and infrastructure, are orchestrating a new era of AI transformation, driving better business outcomes across every role and industry. Now, I’ll highlight examples, walking up the stack, starting with AI infrastructure. Azure again took share, as customers use our platforms and tools to build their own AI solutions. We offer the most diverse selection of AI accelerators, including the latest from NVIDIA, AMD, as well as our own first-party silicon. Our AI innovation continues to build on our strategic partnership with OpenAI. More than 65% of the Fortune 500 now use Azure OpenAI Service. We also continue to innovate and partner broadly to bring customers the best selection of frontier models and open source models, LLMs and SLMs. With Phi-3, which we announced earlier this week, we offer the most capable and cost-effective SLM available. It’s already being trialed by companies like CallMiner, LTIMindtree, PwC, and TCS. Our Models as a Service offering makes it easy for developers to use LLMs and SLMs without having to manage any underlying infrastructure. Hundreds of paid customers, from Accenture and EY, to Schneider Electric, are using it to take advantage of API access to third-party models, including as of this quarter the latest from Cohere, Meta, and Mistral. And, as part of a partnership announced last week, G42 will run its AI applications and services on our cloud. All-up, the number of Azure AI customers continues to grow and average spend continues to increase. We also saw an acceleration of revenue from migrations to Azure. Azure Arc continues to help customers like DICK'S Sporting Goods and World Bank streamline their cloud migrations. Arc now has 33,000 customers, up over 2X year-over-year. And, we are the hyperscale platform of choice for SAP and Oracle workloads, with Conduent and Medline moving their on-premises Oracle estates to Azure, and Kyndryl and L'Oreal migrating their SAP workloads to Azure. Overall, we are seeing an acceleration in the number of large Azure deals from leaders across industries, including billion dollar plus multi-year commitments announced this month from Cloud Software Group and The Coca-Cola Company. The number of $100 million plus Azure deals increased over 80% year-over-year, while the number of $10 million plus deals more than doubled. Now, on to data and analytics. Our Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform provides customers with the broadest capabilities spanning databases, analytics, business intelligence, governance, and AI. Over half of our Azure AI customers also use our data and analytics tools. Customers are building intelligent applications running on Azure, PostgreSQL and Cosmos DB with deep integrations with Azure AI. TomTom is a great example. They’ve used Cosmos DB along with Azure Open AI service to build their own immersive in-car infotainment system. We are also encouraged by our momentum with our next-generation analytics platform, Microsoft Fabric. Fabric now has over 11,000 paid customers, including leaders in every industry from ABB, EDP, Energy Transfer to Equinor, Foot Locker, ITOCHU and Lumen, and we are seeing increased usage intensity. Fabric is seamlessly integrated with Azure AI Studio, meaning customers can run models against enterprise data that’s consolidated in Fabric’s multi-cloud data lake, OneLake. And Power BI, which is also natively integrated with Fabric provides business users with AI-powered insights. We now have over 350,000 paid customers. Now on to developers. GitHub Copilot is bending the productivity curve for developers. We now have 1.8 million paid subscribers with growth accelerating to over 35% quarter-over-quarter and continues to see increased adoption from businesses in every industry, including Itau, Lufthansa Systems, Nokia, Pinterest and Volvo cars. CoPilot is driving growth across the broader GitHub platform, too. AT&T, Citi Group and Honeywell all increased their overall GitHub usage after seeing productivity and code quality increases with CoPilot. All up more than 90% of the Fortune 100 are now GitHub customers and revenue accelerated over 45% year-over-year. Anyone can be a developer with new AI-powered features across our low-code, no-code tools, which makes it easier to build an app, automate workflow or create a Copilot using natural language. 30,000 organizations, across every industry have used Copilot Studio to customize Copilot for Microsoft 365 or build their own, up 175% quarter-over-quarter. Cineplex, for example, built a Copilot for customer service agents, reducing query handling time from as much as 15 minutes to 30 seconds. All up over 330,000 organizations, including over half of Fortune 100 have used AI-powered capabilities in Power Platform, and Power Apps now has over 25 million monthly active users, up over 40% year-over-year. Now on to future of work, we are seeing AI democratize expertise across the workforce. What inventory turns are to efficiency of supply chains, knowledge turns, the creation and diffusion and knowledge are to productivity of an organization. And Copilot for Microsoft 365 is helping increase knowledge turns, thus having a cascading effect changing work, work artifacts and workflows and driving better decision-making, collaboration and efficiency. This quarter, we made Copilot available to organizations of all types and sizes from enterprises to small businesses, nearly 60% of the Fortune 500 now use Copilot and we have seen accelerated adoption across industries and geographies with companies like Amgen, BP, Cognizant, Koch Industries, Moody’s, Novo Nordisk, NVIDIA, and Tech Mahindra purchasing over 10,000 seats. We’re also seeing increased usage intensity from early adopters, including a nearly 50% increase in the number of Copilot-assisted interactions per user in Teams, bridging group activity with business process workflows and enterprise knowledge. And we’re not stopping there. We’re accelerating our innovation, adding over 150 Copilot capabilities since the start of the year. With Copilot and Dynamics 365, we are helping businesses transform every role in business function as we take share with our AI-powered apps across all categories. This quarter, we made our Copilot for Service and Copilot for Sales broadly available, helping customer service agents and sellers at companies like Land O’Lakes, Northern Trust, Rockwell Automation and Toyota Group generate role-specific insights and recommendations from across Dynamics 365 and Microsoft 365, as well as third-party platforms like Salesforce, ServiceNow, and Zendesk. And with our Copilot for Finance, we are drawing context from dynamics, as well as ERP systems like SAP to reduce labor-intensive processes like collections and contract and invoice capture for companies like Dentsu and IDC. ISVs are also building their own co-pilot integrations. For example, new integrations between Adobe Experience Cloud and Copilot will help marketeers access campaign insights in the flow of their work. When it comes to devices, Copilot in Windows is now available on nearly 225 million Windows 10 and Windows 11 PCs, up 2x quarter-over-quarter. With Copilot, we have an opportunity to create an entirely new category of devices, purpose-built for this new generation of AI. All of our largest OEM partners have announced AI PCs in recent months. And this quarter, we introduced new surface devices, which includes integrated NPUs to power on-device AI experiences like auto framing and live captions. And there is much more to come in just a few weeks, we’ll hold a special event to talk about our AI vision across Windows and devices. When it comes to Teams, we once again saw year-over-year usage growth. We’re rolling out a new version, which is up to two times faster while using 50% less memory to all customers. We surpassed 1 million Teams Rooms for the first time as we continue to make hybrid meetings better with new AI-powered features like automatic camera switching and speaker recognition. And Teams Phone continues to be the market leader in cloud calling now with over 20 million PSTN users, up nearly 30% year-over-year. All of this innovation is driving growth across Microsoft 365 companies across the private and public sector, including Amadeus, BlackRock, Chevron, Ecolab, Kimberly-Clark. All chose our premium E5 offerings this quarter for advanced security, compliance, voice and analytics. Now on to industry and cross-industry clouds. We are also bringing AI-powered transformation to every industry. In health care, DAX Copilot is being used by more than 200 health care organizations, including Providence, Stanford Health Care and WellSpan Health. And in manufacturing, this week at Hannover Messe, customers like BMW, Siemens and Volvo Penta shared how they're using our cloud and AI solutions to transform factory operations. Now on to security. Security underpins every layer of the tech stack, and it's our number one priority. We launched our Secure Future Initiative last fall for this reason, bringing together every part of the company to advance cybersecurity protection, and we are doubling down on this very important work, putting security above all else, before all other features and investments. We are focused on making continuous progress across the six pillars of this initiative as we protect tenants and isolate production systems, protect identities and secrets, protect networks, protect engineering systems, monitor and detect threats, and accelerate responses and remediation. We remain committed to sharing our learnings, tools and innovation with customers. A great example is Copilot for Security, which we made generally available earlier this month, bringing together LLMs with domain-specific skills informed by our threat intelligence and 78 trillion daily security signals to provide security teams with actionable insights. Now let me talk about our consumer businesses starting with LinkedIn. We continue to combine our unique data with this new generation of AI to transform the way members learn, sell and get hired. Features like LinkedIn AI-assisted messages are seeing a 40% higher acceptance rate and accepted over 10% faster by job seekers, saving hirers time and making it easier to connect them to candidates. Our AI-powered collaborative articles, which has reached over 12 million contributions are helping increase engagement on the platform, which reached a new record this quarter. New AI features are also helping accelerate LinkedIn Premium growth with revenue up 29% year-over-year. And we are also seeing strength across our other businesses with hiring taking share for the seventh consecutive quarter. Now on to search, advertising and news. We once again took share across Bing and Edge as we continue to apply this new generation of AI to transform how people search and browse. Bing reached over 140 million daily active users, and we are particularly encouraged by our momentum in mobile. Our free Copilot apps on iOS and Android saw a surge in downloads after our Super Bowl ad and are among the highest rated in this category. We also rolled out Copilot to our ad platform this quarter, helping marketeers use AI to generate recommendations for product images, headlines and descriptions. Now on to gaming. We are committed to meeting players where they are by bringing great games to more people on more devices. We set third quarter records for game streaming hours, console usage and monthly active devices. And last month, we added our first Activision Blizzard title Diablo IV to our Game Pass service. Subscribers played over 10 million hours within the first 10 days, making it one of our biggest first-party Game Pass launches ever. We were also encouraged by ongoing success of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, which is attracting new gamers and retaining franchise loyalists. Finally, we are expanding our games to new platforms, bringing four of our fan favorite titles to Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation for the first time. In fact, earlier this month, we had seven games among the top 25 on the PlayStation store more than any other publisher. In closing, I'm energized about our opportunity ahead as we innovate to help people and businesses thrive in this new era. With that, let me turn it over to Amy.",1983.0,1084.0,31.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,0.02859778597785978,0.0036900369003690036,0.0036900369003690036,0.0027675276752767526,0.0027675276752767526,0.024907749077490774
MSFT,2024-04-25,2024-04-26,,2024-04-25,2024-04-25T17:30:00-04:00,0,2024-04-25,qa,qna_heading,Amy Hood,"Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter revenue was $61.9 billion, up 17%; and earnings per share was $2.94, up 20%. Results exceeded expectations, and we delivered another quarter of double-digit top and bottom line growth with continued share gains across many of our businesses. In our commercial business, bookings increased 29% and 31% in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by Azure commitments with an increase in average deal size and deal length as well as strong execution across our core annuity sales motions. In Microsoft 365, suite strength contributed to ARPU expansion for our Office Commercial business, although new business growth continued to moderate for stand-alone products sold outside the Microsoft 365 suite. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 20% and 21% in constant currency to $235 billion. Roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 20% year-over-year. The remaining portion recognized beyond the next 12 months increased 21%. And this quarter, our annuity mix increased to 97%. In our consumer business, PC market demand was slightly better than we expected, benefiting Windows OEM, while advertising spend landed relatively in line with our expectations. In gaming, we also saw better-than-expected performance of Activision titles, benefiting Xbox content and services. At a company level, Activision contributed a net impact of approximately 4 points to revenue growth, was a 2-point drag on operating income growth and had a negative $0.04 impact to earnings per share. A reminder, that this net impact includes adjusting for the movement of Activision content from our prior relationship as a third-party partner to first party and also includes $935 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related costs. FX did not have a significant impact on our results and was roughly in line with our expectations on total company revenue, segment level revenue, COGS and operating expense growth. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $35.1 billion and grew 23%, ahead of expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 72%, a bit better than expected. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, gross margin percentage increased slightly, driven by improvement in Azure and Office 365, even with the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure. Company gross margin dollars increased 18% and gross margin percentage increased slightly year-over-year to 70%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point even with the impact from the purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Growth was driven by the improvement in Azure and Office 365 just mentioned as well as sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 10% with 9 points from the Activision acquisition. At a total company level, head count at the end of March was 1% lower than a year ago. Operating income increased 23% and operating margins increased roughly 2 points year-over-year to 45%, excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins increased roughly 3 points, driven by the higher gross margin noted earlier and improved operating leverage through continued cost discipline. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $19.6 billion and grew 12% and 11% in constant currency, in line with expectations. Office Commercial revenue grew 13% and 12% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 15%, in line with expectations, driven by healthy renewal execution, ARPU growth from continued E5 momentum and early Copilot for Microsoft 365 progress. Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 8% year-over-year with installed base expansion across all customer segments. Seat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings, although growth continued to moderate in SMB. Office Commercial Licensing declined 20% and 18% in constant currency, with continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Office Consumer revenue increased 4%, slightly below expectations. Microsoft 365 subscriptions grew 14% to $80.8 million. LinkedIn revenue increased 10% and 9% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by slightly better-than-expected performance in our premium subscriptions and Talent Solutions businesses. However, in Talent Solutions, bookings growth continues to be impacted by the weaker hiring environment in key verticals. Dynamics revenue grew 19% and 17% in constant currency, ahead of expectations. Growth was driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 23% and 22% in constant currency with continued growth across all workloads and better-than-expected new business, although bookings growth remains moderated. Segment gross margin dollars increased 11%, and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased slightly driven by improvement in Office 365. Operating expenses increased 1% and operating income increased 17% and 16% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $26.7 billion, increasing 21%, ahead of expectations with better-than-expected results across all businesses. Overall, Server products and cloud services revenue grew 24%. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 31% ahead of expectations, while our AI services contributed 7 points of growth as expected. In the non-AI portion of our consumption business, we saw greater-than-expected demand broadly across industries and customer segments as well as some benefit from a greater-than-expected mix of contracts with higher in-period recognition. In our per-user business, the Enterprise Mobility and Security installed base grew 10% to over 274 million seats, with continued impact from the growth trends in new stand-alone business noted earlier. In our on-premises server business, revenue increased 6%, ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected renewal strength, particularly for contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition. Enterprise and partner services revenue decreased 9% on a strong prior year comparable for enterprise support services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 20% and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate [indiscernible] percentage increased slightly, primarily driven by the improvement in Azure noted earlier, even with the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure. Operating expenses increased 1% and operating income grew 32%. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $15.6 billion, increasing 17% with 15 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Results were above expectations, driven by better-than-expected performance in gaming and Windows OEM. Windows OEM revenue increased 11% year-over-year, ahead of expectations, primarily driven by the slightly better PC market noted earlier as well as mix shift to higher monetizing markets. Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 13% and 12% in constant currency, below expectations with impact from the growth trends in new stand-alone business noted earlier as well as lower in-period revenue recognition from a mix of contracts. Devices revenue decreased 17% and 16% in constant currency as we remain focused on our higher-margin premium products. Overall, Surface demand was slightly lower than expected. Search and News advertising revenue ex TAC increased 12% ahead of expectations with continued volume growth and increased engagement on Bing and Edge. And in gaming. Revenue increased 51% and 50% in constant currency with 55 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Results were ahead of expectations, primarily driven by Call of Duty. Xbox content and services revenue increased 62% and 61% in constant currency with 61 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Xbox hardware revenue decreased 31% and 30% in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars increased 27% and 26% in constant currency, with 13 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Gross margin percentage increased roughly 4 points year-over-year, primarily driven by sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 41% with 43 points from the Activision acquisition. Operating income increased 16% and 15% in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $14 billion to support our cloud demand, inclusive of the need to scale our AI infrastructure. Cash paid for PP&E was $11 billion. Cash flow from operations was $31.9 billion, up 31%, driven by strong cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $21 billion, up 18% year-over-year, reflecting higher capital expenditures to support our cloud and AI offerings. This quarter, other income and expense was negative $854 million, lower than anticipated, driven by losses on investments accounted for under the equity method. Our effective tax rate was approximately 18%. And finally, we returned $8.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Now moving to our Q4 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S. dollar basis. First, FX. Based on current rates, which reflect the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we now expect FX to decrease total revenue and segment level revenue growth by less than 1 point. When compared to our January guide for Q4, FX, this is a decrease to total revenue of roughly $700 million. We expect FX to decrease COGS growth by approximately 1 point and operating expense growth by less than 1 point. In commercial bookings, we expect solid growth on a relatively flat expiry base driven by continued strong commercial sales execution. As a reminder, larger, long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, can drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should decrease roughly 2 points year-over-year. Excluding the impact from the change in accounting estimate, Q4 cloud gross margin percentage will be down slightly as improvement in Azure, inclusive of scaling our AI infrastructure will be offset by sales mix shift to Azure. We expect capital expenditures to increase materially on a sequential basis driven by cloud and AI infrastructure investments. As a reminder, there can be normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure build-outs and the timing of finance leases. We continue to bring capacity online as we scale our AI investments with growing demand. Currently, near-term AI demand is a bit higher than our available capacity. Next, to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 9% and 11% in constant currency or US$19.9 billion to US$20.2 billion. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth primarily through E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be approximately 14% in constant currency. We continue to progress with adoption of CoPilot for Microsoft 365 and remain excited for the long-term growth opportunity. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the mid to high teens. In Office Consumer, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the mid to high single digits driven by continued growth across all businesses. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-teens, driven by Dynamics 365. For both LinkedIn and Dynamics, the continued bookings growth moderation noted earlier is a headwind to Q4 revenue growth. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 19% and 20% in constant currency or US$28.4 billion to US$28.7 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q4 revenue growth to be 30% to 31% in constant currency or similar to our stronger-than-expected Q3 results. Growth will be driven by our Azure Consumption business and continued contribution from AI with some impact from the AI capacity availability noted earlier. Our per-user business should see benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum. Though we expect continued moderation in seat growth rates given the size of the installed base. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits with continued hybrid demand, including licenses running in multi-cloud environments. And in Enterprise and Partner Services revenue should decline in the mid- to high single digits on a high prior year comparable for enterprise support services. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to grow between 10% and 13% in constant currency or US$15.2 billion to US$15.6 billion. Windows OEM revenue growth should be in the low to mid-single digits as PC market unit volumes continue at pre-pandemic levels. In Windows Commercial Products and Cloud Services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive revenue growth in the mid-single digits. As a reminder, our quarterly revenue growth can have variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Devices, revenue should decline in the mid-teens as we continue to focus on our higher-margin premium products. Search and news advertising ex TAC revenue growth should be in the low to mid-teens, driven by continued volume strength. This will be higher than overall search and news advertising revenue growth, which we expect to be relatively flat. And in Gaming, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-40s, including approximately 50 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth in the high 50s driven by approximately 60 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Hardware revenue will decline again year-over-year. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS between US$19.6 billion to US$19.8 billion, including approximately $700 million from purchase accounting, integration and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. We expect operating expense of US$17.15 billion to US$17.25 billion, including approximately $300 million from purchase accounting, integration and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Therefore, we now expect full year FY2024 operating margins to be up over 2 points year-over-year, even with our cloud and AI investments, the impact from the Activision acquisition and the headwind from the change in useful lives last year. This operating margin expansion reflects the hard work across every team to drive efficiencies and maintain disciplined cost management, knowing we will continue to grow our cloud and AI investments next year. Other income and expense should be roughly negative $850 million as interest income will be more than offset by interest expense and losses on investments accounted for under the equity method. As a reminder, we are required to recognize gains or losses on our equity investments which can increase quarterly volatility. We expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be approximately 18%. Now I’d like to share some closing thoughts as we look to the next fiscal year. We continue to focus on building businesses that create meaningful value for our customers and therefore, significant growth opportunities for years to come. In FY2025, that focus on execution should again lead to double-digit revenue and operating income growth to scale to meet the growing demand signal for our cloud and AI products, we expect FY2025 capital expenditures to be higher than FY2024. These expenditures over the course of the next year are dependent on demand signals and adoption of our services. So we will manage that signal through the year. We will also continue to prioritize operating leverage. And therefore, we expect FY2025 operating margins to be down only about 1 point year-over-year, even with our significant cloud and AI investments, as well as a full year of impact from the Activision acquisition. We are leading the AI platform wave and are committed to bringing that value to our global customers as we enter the final quarter of our fiscal year.

It looks like Microsoft is on track to ramp CapEx over 50% year-on-year this year to over $50 billion. And there’s media speculation of more spending ahead with some reports talking about like $100 billion data center. So obviously, investments are coming well ahead of the revenue contribution. But what I was hoping for is that you could give us some color on how use as the management team, try to quantify the potential opportunities that underlie these investments because they are getting very big.

At a high level, the way we, as a management team, talk about it is there are two sides to this, right? There is training and their inference. Given that we want to be a leader in this big generational shift and paradigm shift in technology, that's on the training side. We want to be able to allocate the capital required to essentially be training these large foundation models and stay on the leadership position there. And we've done that successfully all the way today, and you've seen it flow through our P&L, and you can continue to see that going forward. Then Amy referenced what we also do on the inference side, which is, one, we first innovate and build products. And of course, we have an infrastructure business that's also dependent on a lot of ISVs building products that run on our infrastructure. And it's all going to be demand driven. In other words, we track – we're closely what's happening with inference demand, and that's something that we will manage, as Amy said in her remarks very, very closely. So we feel – and obviously, we've been doing this, quite frankly, Keith, for now multiple years. So this is not the quarter. I realize in the news, it's a lot more in the quarter nowadays. But if you look at it, we have been doing what is essentially capital allocation to be a leader in AI for multiple years now, and we plan to sort of essentially keep taking that forward.",278.0,110.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.03636363636363636,0.00909090909090909,0.00909090909090909,0.0,0.01818181818181818,0.02727272727272727

And we look forward to being able to continue to build out the infrastructure needed to meet the demand. Another thing that you’ve really asked in the beginning was the opportunity and the size of that. And I think in some ways, it's important to think about every business process that can be impacted and the opportunity that's represented by every business process. And so when you think of it that way, I think the opportunity is significant. The opportunity to power that next wave of “cloud infrastructure” is important. It's important because we've been the leader for this decade of the cloud transition, and it's important for us to confidently invest to do that in the second wave, building on our success in the first. And I think that's really the best way to think about how we'll spend is the same way we approached it for a decade.

On the Azure side, which I think is what you specifically asked, we feel very good about the – we are fundamentally a share taker there because if you look at it from our perspective at this point, Azure has become a protocol for pretty much anybody who is doing an AI project. And so that's sort of been a significant help for us in terms of acquiring even new customers. Some of the logos I even referenced in my remarks, our new Azure customers. So, that's one. The second thing that we're also seeing is AI just doesn't sit on its own. So, AI projects obviously start with calls to AI models, but they also use a vector database. In fact, Azure Search, which is really used by even ChatGPT is one of the fastest-growing services for us. We have Fabric integration to Azure AI. And so, Cosmos DB integration. So, the data tier, the dev tools is another place where we are seeing great traction. So, we are seeing adjacent services in Azure that get attached to AI. And lastly, I would say, migrations to Azure as well. So, this is not just all an AI story. We are also looking at customers, I mean, this is something that we have talked about in the past, which is there's always an optimization cycle, but there's also – as people optimize, they spend money on new project starts, which will grow and then they'll optimize. So, it's a continuous side of it. So, these are the three trends that are playing out on Azure in terms of what at least we see on demand side.",295.0,126.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.007936507936507936,0.007936507936507936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I want to follow up on the AI, obviously. We’re seeing companies shifting their IT spending to invest in and learn about AI rather than receiving additional budgets for AI. At some point, for AI to be transformative, as everyone expects, it needs to be accretive to spending. Satya, when do you believe AI will hit the maturity level, will be net increase to IT or outside of IT spending? And what would be the leading indicators of that maturation? And Amy, am I characterizing this correctly as it relates to Azure? Some projects are being delayed so that, that spending could be shifted from core Azure toward Azure AI?

Let me just start by saying, a good place to start is to watch what’s happening in terms of standard issues for software teams, right? I mean if you think about it, they bought tools in the past. Now, you basically buy tools plus Copilot, right? So, you could even say that this is characterized as perhaps shift of what is OpEx dollars into effectively tool spend because it gives operating leverage to all of the OpEx dollars you’re spending today, right? That’s really a good example of, I think, what’s going to happen across the board. We see that in customer service. We see that in sales. We see that in marketing. Anywhere, there’s operations. That’s why I described it as knowledge turns. You can even think of it as lean for knowledge work, right, because it just reduces waste, increases speed, and customer value. And so, one of the interesting rate limiters here is culture change inside of organizations. When I say culture change that means process change. And Amy referenced this even in her answer to the first question because at the end of the day companies will have to take a process, simplify the process, automate the process, and apply these solutions. And so that requires not just technology, but in fact, companies to go do the hard work of culturally changing how they adopt technology to drive that operating leverage. And this is where we are going to see firm-level performance differences. So, one of the things we see is any customer who is working closely with us deploying it internally at Microsoft we see it, right. We’re also taking our own medicine to apply this across every process. And we know that this is not just about technology, it’s about being able to have the methodology that goes with it. And so, we see it in software development. We see it in customer service. We’re seeing it even in the horizontal use of Copilot today where every day people are discovering new workflows that they can optimize. And so, that’s like the PC when it became standard issue in early 1990s. That’s the closest analogy I can come up with. And so, yes, it will take time for it to percolate through the economy, but this is faster diffusion, faster rate of adoption than anything we have seen in the past, as evidenced even by Copilot, right. It’s faster than any suite we have sold in the past, but it is going to require workflow and process change.",443.0,210.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.014285714285714285,0.009523809523809525,0.009523809523809525,0.0,0.009523809523809525,0.004761904761904762

In our results, that’s not what we saw. We saw more what Satya was speaking to earlier, which is, you see maybe growth in migrations again. You’re seeing work in the data space, again, and you’re seeing AI project starts. And I think that’s why maybe you see our growth be different, of course, than you see IT budget spend. It’s because it’s a share, I think, improvement plus also really focusing on what Satya said, it’s about spending maybe in other areas that we don’t traditionally think of as being in the IT budget spend under a CIO.

So, you’re absolutely right to start there, and it’s a good question. The way to think about it is a bit more by – it is how much capacity we have in play and how much capacity that we have to sell on the inferencing side, in particular. And so, that is partially why you see the capital investment in the shape that is, is because right this minute, we do have demand that exceeds our supply by a bit.

So the way we see it play out is, if you think about it, the way Office was used broadly for knowledge work was in the context of business processes, right? So it's not like – when people do knowledge work, they're not doing knowledge work, they're doing knowledge work and support of making progress in the context of sales enablement, customer service, revenue ops, supply chain or what have you, right? So that's the first thing to note. And they do it inside of e-mail. They do it inside of Teams. They do it inside of Excel, PowerPoint, Word and what have you. Now we have the ability to essentially bridge the work and the work artifacts inside of these knowledge worker tools with the workflow and the business process and the business process data. So when we think about our Copilot, our Copilot has that ability to integrate, whether it's with ServiceNow, it has the ability to integrate with SAP with Salesforce, with obviously Dynamics. That's what we are seeing. In fact, you'll hear us talk a lot about it at our developer conference, which is the extensibility and Copilot Studio is really off to the races in terms of the product that most people are excited because one of the things in the enterprise if you want to ground your Copilot with enterprise data, which is in all of these SaaS applications and Copilot Studio is the tool to use it, to make that happen. And so that's what we are seeing, which is we are building a Copilot, which also happens to be an orchestrator of all in other Copilots, which to us appear as extensions. And net-net, what happens is some of these knowledge worker tools that people have used all the time, right? Because when you think about Teams, when you're having a meeting, you're not doing a random meeting, the meeting is in the context of some business process. It could be a supply chain meeting where you're trying to understand which suppliers to bet on or what terms to do. And so now you can access all that data right in the Team's context. So that's I think what's exciting for us, having built all these horizontal tools, which I would say we're under underappreciated for the amount of work.

When you think about – we've been talking about sort of stabilization and what you saw this quarter, if you break down the Azure number as you saw, which I think I talked a little bit about with Karl was 7 points of contribution from AI, and you could call them the difference '24 from our core really Azure business. And within that, the activity we saw and the consumption side was really this balance that we were quite used to and have seen throughout the cloud transition. We saw new workload starts and we saw optimizations. And then those optimizations create new budget, and you apply it. And that cycle which is actually quite normal. We saw it again this quarter in a balanced way. And I think when we talk about stabilization or even what we saw between Q2 and Q3, which is a bit of acceleration in that core, was a lot of the newer project starts relating back to not just AI starts, but lots of other workflows. The companies are still going from on-prem to cloud, Satya mentioned migrations. And some of that, which I know isn't as exciting as talking about all the AI projects. This is still really foundational work to allow companies to take advantage of the cost savings and the total TCO is still really good. And so I think that balance is really what you saw this quarter, and I do feel like there wasn't really a big difference, Michael, across industries or across geos. So I would say it was actually pretty consistent is the other maybe texture that I could give you to that question. And so then when you're saying do we keep sort of pointing to stabilization, I really do look sort of workload to workload. What are we seeing? Where it starts? And this one actually felt quite balanced and optimization looks like they normally would, which by the way, is super important. It's something we encourage customers to do. You want to run your workloads as efficiently as you possibly can. It's critical to customers being able to grow and get value out of that. So I sometimes think we – you all may ask the question more as a negative. And for us, it's just about a healthy cycle at the customer account level.",413.0,179.0,9.0,4.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,0.0,0.05027932960893855,0.0223463687150838,0.03910614525139665,0.0,0.0,0.027932960893854747

I mean if you sort of say this, what is this AI, it does two things, right? There's a new user experience, there is a natural language interface and second thing is it's the reasoning engine. And the reasoning engine requires good data, and it's good requires, good data for grounding, right? So people talk about something called retrieval augmented generation. And in that context, having good grounding data that then help with the reasoning, I think, is helpful. And then, of course, people are also looking to sort of fine-tune or RLHF or essentially take the large model and ground it further. So all of these tools are now available, the sophistication of how to people can deploy these models across various business processes where there is data and where there is tuning of these models is also getting more widespread, even at system integrators and other developers are there to help enterprises. So all that's maturing. So we feel good. And this is what I think on the commercial side, these are some of the harder problems to solve broad consumer, right? I mean I think this is a couple of orders of magnitude of improvements in, I'll call it, our models before we can sort of have more sophisticated open-ended consumer scenarios. Whereas in the enterprise, these are all things we can go tackle. Again, I point to get up, if you think about how it's got an entire system, right? It's just not an AI model. It's the, AI – the user experience, scaffolding, the editor, the chat, then interpreter and the debugger work along with the continuations of the model to help essentially create these reasoning traces, which help the entire thing work. And effectively, what we are doing with Copilot, Copilot Studio and connectors to all these business systems, think of it as we are creating GitHub Copilot like scenarios for every business system. That's what I think is going to have both what Amy referenced is business value and better grounding. But you're absolutely right in saying a lot of work we're doing with Fabric or Cosmos or PostgreSQL is about preparing that data so that it can be integrated with these AI projects.",409.0,182.0,8.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04395604395604396,0.01098901098901099,0.0,0.005494505494505495,0.01098901098901099,0.03296703296703297

I wanted to ask the AI question but from a Microsoft 365 Copilot perspective. I think you talked a little bit about starting to see some of those impacts positively in the quarter on the office business. I wanted to ask more broadly around that capacity constraint that you alluded to in your prepared remarks, Amy. And kind of how does the easing – how tied are we like as you invest for that CapEx and bring more of the capacity online.

And I would not say that there is a capacity constraint on the Copilots. It's a real priority for us to make sure we optimize the allocation of our capacity to make sure that those per user businesses are able to continue to grow. And so think about that as our priority one. And so then what that does mean is capacity constraints when we have them, you'll tend to see them on the Azure infrastructure side, the consumption side of the business is a better way of thinking about it",104.0,43.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09302325581395349,0.023255813953488372,0.0,0.0,0.046511627906976744,0.06976744186046512

MSFT,2024-07-30,2024-07-31,,2024-07-30,2024-07-30T17:30:00-04:00,0,2024-07-30,prepared,,Satya Nadella,"Thank you, Brett. We had a solid close to our fiscal year. All-up, annual revenue was more than $245 billion, up 15% year-over-year. And Microsoft Cloud revenue surpassed $135 billion, up 23%. Before I dive in, I want to offer some broader perspective on the AI platform shift. Similar to the cloud, this transition involves both knowledge and capital intensive investments. And as we go through this shift, we are focused on two fundamental things: First, driving innovation across a product portfolio that spans infrastructure and applications so as to ensure that we are maximizing our opportunity, while in parallel continuing to scale our cloud business and prioritizing fundamentals, starting with security. Second, using customer demand signal and time to value to manage our cost structure dynamically and generate durable, long-term operating leverage. With that, let me highlight examples, starting with Azure. Our share gains accelerated this year, driven by AI. We expanded our datacenter footprint, announcing investments across four continents. These are long-term assets around the world to drive growth for the next decade and beyond. We added new AI accelerators from AMD and NVIDIA, as well as our own first party silicon Azure Maia. And we introduced new Cobalt 100, which provides best-in-class performance for customers like Elastic, MongoDB, Siemens, Snowflake, and Teradata. We continued to see sustained revenue growth from migrations. Azure Arc is helping customers in every industry, from ABB and Cathay Pacific, to LaLiga, to streamline their cloud migrations. We now have 36,000 Arc customers, up 90% year-over-year. We remain the hyperscale cloud of choice for SAP and Oracle workloads. Atos, Coles, Daimler Truck AG, Domino’s, Haleon, for example, all migrated their mission-critical SAP workloads to our cloud. And with our Azure VMware Solution, we offer the fastest and most cost-effective way for customers to migrate their VMware workloads too. With Azure AI, we are building out the app server for the AI wave, providing access to the most diverse selection of models to meet customers’ unique cost, latency, and design considerations. All-up, we now have over 60,000 Azure AI customers, up nearly 60% year-over-year, and average spend per customer continues to grow. Azure OpenAI Service provides access to best-in-class frontier models, including as of this quarter GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini. It is being used by leading companies in every industry, including H&R Block, Suzuki, Swiss Re, Telstra as well as digital natives like Freshworks, Meesho, and Zomato. With Phi-3, we offer a family of powerful, small language models, which are being used by companies like BlackRock, Emirates, Epic, ITC, Navy Federal Credit Union, and others. And with Models as a Service, we provide API access to third-party models, including as of last week the latest from Cohere, Meta, and Mistral. The number of paid Models as a Service customers more than doubled quarter-over-quarter, and we are seeing increased usage by leaders in every industry, from Adobe and Bridgestone, to Novo Nordisk and Palantir. Now, on to data. Our Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform provides customers with the broadest capabilities spanning databases, analytics, business intelligence, and governance along with seamless integration with all of our AI services. The number of Azure AI customers also using our data and analytics tools grew nearly 50% year-over-year. Microsoft Fabric, our AI-powered next generation data platform – now has over 14,000 paid customers, including leaders in every industry, from Accenture and Kroger, to Rockwell Automation and Zeiss up 20% quarter-over-quarter. And, this quarter, we introduced new first-of-their-kind real-time intelligence capabilities in Fabric so customers can unlock insights on high-volume, time sensitive data. Now, on to developer tools. GitHub Copilot is by far the most widely adopted AI-powered developer tool. Just over two years since its general availability, more than 77,000 organizations from BBVA, FedEx, and H&M, to Infosys and Paytm have adopted Copilot, up 180% year-over-year. And we are going further. With Copilot Workspace, we offer Copilot-native end-to-end developer productivity across plan, build, test, debug, and deploy cycle. Copilot is driving GitHub growth, all up, GitHub’s annual revenue run rate is now $2 billion. Copilot accounted for over 40% of GitHub revenue growth this year, and is already a larger business than all of GitHub was when we acquired it. We are also integrating generative AI across Power Platform, enabling anyone to use natural language to create apps, automate workflows, or build a website. To date, over 480,000 organizations have used AI-powered capabilities in Power Platform, up 45% quarter-over-quarter. In total, we now have 48 million monthly active users of Power Platform, up 40% year-over-year. Now, on to future of work. Copilot for Microsoft 365 is becoming a daily habit for knowledge workers, as it transforms work, workflow, and work artifacts. The number of people who use Copilot daily at work nearly doubled quarter-over-quarter, as they use it to complete tasks faster, hold more effective meetings, and automate business workflows and processes. Copilot customers increased more than 60% quarter-over-quarter. Feedback has been positive, with majority of enterprise customers coming back to purchase more seats. All-up, the number of customers with more than 10,000 seats more than doubled quarter-over-quarter, including Capital Group, Disney, Dow, Kyndryl, Novartis. And EY alone will deploy Copilot to 150,000 of its employees. And we are going further, adding agent capabilities to Copilot. New Team Copilot can facilitate meetings, and create and assign tasks. And, with Copilot Studio, customers can extend Copilot for Microsoft 365 and build custom copilots that proactively respond to data and events using their own first and third-party business data. To date, 50,000 organizations from Carnival Corporation, Cognizant, and Eaton, to KPMG, Majesco, and McKinsey have used Copilot Studio, up over 70% quarter-over-quarter. We are also extending Copilot to specific industries, including healthcare, with DAX Copilot. More than 400 healthcare organizations including Community Health Network, Intermountain, Northwestern Memorial Healthcare, and Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center have purchased DAX Copilot to date, up 40% quarter-over-quarter, and the number of AI-generated clinical reports more than tripled. Copilot is also transforming ERP and CRM business applications. We again took share this quarter, as customers like ThermoFisher Scientific switched to Dynamics. Our new Dynamics 365 Contact Center is a Copilot-first solution that infuses generative AI throughout the contact center workflow. Companies like 1-800 Flowers, Mediterranean Shipping, Synoptek will rely on it to deliver better customer support. And Dynamics 365 Business Central is now trusted by over 40,000 organizations for core ERP. Microsoft Teams has become essential to how hundreds of millions of people meet, call, chat, collaborate, and do business. We once again saw year-over-year usage growth. Teams Premium has surpassed 3 million seats, up nearly 400% year-over-year, as organizations like dentsu, Eli Lilly, and Ford chose it for advanced features like end-to-end encryption and real-time translation. When it comes to devices, we introduced our new category of Copilot+ PCs this quarter. They are the fastest, most intelligent Windows PCs ever, and they include a new system architecture designed to deliver best-in-class performance and breakthrough AI experiences. We are delighted by early reviews. And we are looking forward to the introduction of more Copilot+ PCs powered by all of our silicon and OEM partners in the coming months. More broadly, Windows 11 active devices increased 50% year-over-year. And we are seeing accelerated adoption of Windows 11 by companies like Carlsberg, E.ON, National Australia Bank. Now, on to security. We continue to prioritize security above all else. We are doubling down on our Secure Future Initiative, as we implement our principles of secure by design, secure by default, and secure operations. Through this initiative, we are also continually applying what we are learning, and translating it into innovation for our customers, including how we approach AI. Over 1,000 paid customers used Copilot for Security, including Alaska Airlines, Oregon State University, Petrofac, Wipro, WTW. And we are also securing customers’ AI deployments, with updates to Defender and Purview. All-up, we now have over 1.2 million security customers. Over 800,000 including Dell Technologies, Deutsche Telekom, TomTom use four or more workloads, up 25% year-over-year. And Defender for Cloud, our cloud security solution, surpassed $1 billion in revenue over the past 12 months as we protect customer workloads across multi-cloud and hybrid environments. Now, let me turn to our consumer businesses, starting with LinkedIn. LinkedIn continues to see accelerated member growth and record engagement. 1.5 million pieces of content are shared every minute on the platform. And video is now the fastest growing format on LinkedIn, with uploads up 34% year-over-year. LinkedIn Marketing Solutions continues to be a leader in B2B digital advertising, helping companies deliver the right message, to the right audience, on a safe, trusted platform. And when it comes to our subscription businesses, Premium sign ups increased 51% this fiscal year, and we are adding even more value to our members and customers with new AI tools. Our reimagined AI-powered LinkedIn Premium experience is now available for every Premium subscriber worldwide, helping them more easily and intuitively connect to opportunity, learn, and get career coaching. Finally, hiring took share for the second consecutive year. And, now, on to Search, Advertising and News. We are ensuring that Bing, Edge, and Copilot collectively are driving more engagement and value to end-users, publishers, and advertisers. Our overall revenue ex-TAC increased 19% year-over-year, and we again took share across Bing and Edge. We continue to apply generative AI to pioneer new approaches to how people search and browse. Just last week, we announced we are testing a new generative search experience, which creates a dynamic response to a user’s query, while maintaining click share to publishers. And we continue to drive record engagement with Copilot for the web. Consumers have used Copilot to create over 12 billion images and conduct 13 billion chats to date, up 150% since the start of the calendar year. Thousands of news and entertainment publishers trust us to reach new audiences with Microsoft Start. And, in fact, we have paid them $1 billion over the last five years. We are helping advertisers increase their ROI too. We have seen positive response to Performance Max, which uses AI to dynamically create and optimize ads. And Copilot in Microsoft Ad Platform helps marketers create campaigns and troubleshoot using natural language. Now, on to gaming. We now have over 500 million monthly active users across platforms and devices. And our content pipeline has never been stronger. We previewed a record 30 new titles at our showcase this quarter. 18 of them such as Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will be available on Game Pass. Game Pass Ultimate subscribers can now stream games directly on the devices they already have, including as of last month, Amazon Fire TVs. Finally, we are bringing our IP to new audiences. Fallout, for example, made its debut as a TV show on Amazon Prime this quarter. It was the second most watched title on the platform ever, and hours played on Game Pass for Fallout franchise increased nearly 5x quarter-over-quarter. In closing, I am energized about the opportunities ahead. We are investing for the long-term in our fundamentals, in our innovation, and in our people. With that, let me turn it over to Amy.",1892.0,1018.0,24.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,5.0,1.0,0.023575638506876228,0.0029469548133595285,0.004911591355599214,0.0009823182711198428,0.0,0.0206286836935167

This quarter, revenue was $64.7 billion, up 15% and 16% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.95 and increased 10% and 11% in constant currency. In our largest quarter of the year, we again delivered double-digit top and bottom line growth with continued share gains across many of our businesses and record commitments to our Microsoft Cloud platform. Commercial bookings were significantly ahead of expectations and increased 17% and 19% in constant currency. This record commitment quarter was driven by growth in the number of 10-million-dollar-plus and 100-million-dollar-plus contracts for both Azure and Microsoft 365 and consistent execution across our core annuity sales motions. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 20% and 21% in constant currency to $269 billion. Roughly 40% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 18% year-over-year. The remaining portion, recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 21%. And this quarter, our annuity mix was 97%. At a company level, Activision contributed a net impact of approximately 3 points to revenue growth, was a 2 point drag on operating income growth, and had a negative $0.06 impact to earnings per share. A reminder that this net impact includes adjusting for the movement of Activision content from our prior relationship as a third-party partner to first-party, and includes $938 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration, and transaction-related costs. FX did not have a significant impact on our results and was roughly in line with our expectations on total company revenue, segment level revenue, COGS, and operating expense growth. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $36.8 billion and grew 21% and 22% in constant currency, roughly in line with expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased roughly 2 points year-over-year to 69% in line with expectations. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, gross margin percentage decreased slightly driven by sales mix shift to Azure, partially offset by improvement in Azure even with the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure. Company gross margin dollars increased 14% and 15% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 70%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased slightly, even with the impact from purchase accounting adjustments, integration, and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Operating expenses increased 13% with 9 points from the Activision acquisition. At a total company level, headcount at the end of June was 3% higher than a year ago. Operating income increased 15% and 16% in constant currency and operating margins were 43%, relatively unchanged year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins increased slightly driven by the higher gross margin noted earlier and improved operating leverage through continued cost discipline. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $20.3 billion and grew 11% and 12% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations driven by better-than-expected results across all business units. Office commercial revenue grew 12% and 13% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 13% and 14% in constant currency with ARPU growth primarily from E5 momentum as well as Copilot for Microsoft 365. Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 7% year-over-year with installed base expansion across all customer segments. Seat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings, although both segments continued to moderate. Office commercial licensing declined 9% and 7% in constant currency, with continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Office consumer revenue increased 3% and 4% in constant currency with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 10% to 82.5 million. LinkedIn revenue increased 10% and 9% in constant currency driven by better-than-expected performance across all businesses. Dynamics revenue grew 16% driven by Dynamics 365 which grew 19% and 20% in constant currency. We saw continued growth across all workloads and better-than-expected new business. Dynamics 365 now represents roughly 90% of total Dynamics revenue. Segment gross margin dollars increased 9% and 10% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 1 point year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased slightly driven by Office 365 as we scale our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 5%, and operating income increased 12% and 13% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $28.5 billion, increasing 19% and 20% in constant currency, in line with expectations. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue grew 21% and 22% in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 29% and 30% in constant currency, in line with expectations and consistent with Q3 when adjusting for leap year. Azure growth included 8 points from AI services where demand remained higher than our available capacity. In June, we saw slightly lower-than-expected growth in a few European geos. In our per-user business, the enterprise mobility and security installed base grew 10% to over 281 million seats with continued impact from moderated growth in seats sold outside the Microsoft 365 suite. Therefore, our Azure consumption business continues to grow faster than total Azure. In our on-premises server business, revenue increased 2% and 3% in constant currency. Growth was driven by demand for our hybrid solutions although with slightly lower-than-expected transactional purchasing. Enterprise and partner services revenue decreased 7% on a strong prior year comparable for Enterprise Support Services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 16% and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 2 points year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased slightly driven by sales mix shift to Azure, partially offset by the improvement in Azure noted earlier, even with the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 5% and operating income grew 22% and 23% in constant currency. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $15.9 billion, increasing 14% and 15% in constant currency, with 12 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Results were above expectations driven by Windows commercial and Search. The PC market was as expected and Windows OEM revenue increased 4% year-over-year. Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 11% and 12% in constant currency, ahead of expectations due to higher in-period revenue recognition from the mix of contracts. Devices revenue decreased 11% and 9% in constant currency, roughly in line with expectations, as we remain focused on our higher margin premium products. While early days, we’re excited about the recent launch of our Copilot+ PCs. Search and news advertising revenue ex-TAC increased 19%, ahead of expectations, primarily due to improved execution. Healthy volume growth was driven by Bing and Edge. And in Gaming, revenue increased 44% with 48 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Xbox content and services revenue increased 61%, slightly ahead of expectations, with 58 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Stronger-than-expected performance in first-party content was partially offset by third-party content performance. Xbox hardware revenue decreased 42% and 41% in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars increased 21%, with 10 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Gross margin percentage increased roughly 3 points year-over-year primarily driven by sales mix shift to higher margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 43% with 41 points from the Activision acquisition. Operating income increased 5% and 6% in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures including finance leases were $19 billion, in line with expectations, and cash paid for PP&E was $13.9 billion. Cloud and AI related spend represents nearly all of total capital expenditures. Within that, roughly half is for infrastructure needs where we continue to build and lease datacenters that will support monetization over the next 15 years and beyond. The remaining cloud and AI related spend is primarily for servers, both CPUs and GPUs, to serve customers based on demand signals. For the full fiscal year, the mix of our cloud and AI related spend was similar to Q4. Cash flow from operations was $37.2 billion, up 29% driven by strong cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $23.3 billion, up 18% year-over-year, reflecting higher capital expenditures to support our cloud and AI offerings. For the full-year, cash flow from operations surpassed $100 billion for the first time, reaching $119 billion. This quarter, other income and expense was negative $675 million, more favorable than anticipated with lower-than-expected interest expense and higher-than-expected interest income. Our losses on investments accounted for under the equity method were as expected. Our effective tax rate was approximately 19%, higher than anticipated due to a state tax law signed in June that was effective retroactively. And finally, we returned $8.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, bringing our total cash returned to shareholders to over $34 billion for the full fiscal year. Now, moving to our outlook. My commentary for both the full-year and next quarter is on a U.S. dollar basis unless specifically noted otherwise. Let me start with some full year commentary for FY2025. First, FX. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to have no meaningful impact to full-year revenue, COGS, or operating expense growth. Next, we continue to expect double-digit revenue and operating income growth as we focus on delivering differentiated value for our customers. To meet the growing demand signal for our AI and cloud products, we will scale our infrastructure investments with FY2025 capital expenditures expected to be higher than FY2024. As a reminder, these expenditures are dependent on demand signals and adoption of our services that will be managed through the year. As scaling these investments drives growth in COGS, we will remain disciplined on operating expense management. Therefore, we expect FY2025 OpEx growth to be in the single digits. And given our focused commitment to managing at the operating margin level, we still expect FY2025 operating margins to be down only about one point year-over-year. And finally, we expect our FY2025 effective tax rate to be around 19%. Now, to the outlook for our first quarter. Based on current rates, we expect FX to decrease total revenue and segment level revenue growth by less than one point. We expect FX to decrease COGS growth by less than one point and to have no meaningful impact to operating expense growth. In commercial bookings, increased long-term commitments to our platform and strong execution across core annuity sales motions should drive healthy growth on a growing expiry base. As a reminder, larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, can drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be roughly 70%, down year-over-year driven by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure. We expect capital expenditures to increase on a sequential basis given our cloud and AI demand, as well as existing AI capacity constraints. As a reminder, there can be quarterly spend variability from cloud infrastructure buildouts and the timing of delivery of finance leases. Next to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 10% and 11% in constant currency, or US$20.3 to US$20.6 billion. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5 and Copilot for Microsoft 365. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be approximately 14% in constant currency. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the mid to high-teens. In Office consumer, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the high single digits driven by continued growth across all businesses. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-teens driven by Dynamics 365. For Intelligent Cloud we expect revenue to grow between 18% and 20% in constant currency, or US$28.6 billion to US$28.9 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q1 revenue growth to be 28% to 29% in constant currency. Growth will continue to be driven by our consumption business, inclusive of AI, which is growing faster than total Azure. We expect the consumption trends from Q4 to continue through the first half of the year. This includes both AI demand impacted by capacity constraints and non-AI growth trends similar to June. Growth in our per-user business will continue to moderate. And in H2, we expect Azure growth to accelerate as our capital investments create an increase in available AI capacity to serve more of the growing demand. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline in the low single digits as continued hybrid demand will be more than offset by lower transactional purchasing. And in Enterprise and partner services, revenue should decline in the low single digits. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to grow between 9% and 12% in constant currency, or US$14.9 billion to US$15.3 billion. Windows OEM revenue growth should be relatively flat, roughly in line with the PC market. In Windows commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive revenue growth in the mid-single digits. As a reminder, our quarterly revenue growth can have variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Devices, revenue growth should be in the low to mid-single digits. Search and news advertising ex-TAC revenue growth should be in the mid to high-teens. This will be higher than overall Search and news advertising revenue growth, which we expect to be in the low single digits. And in Gaming, we expect revenue growth in the mid-30s, including approximately 40 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth in the low to mid-50s, driven by the net impact from the Activision acquisition. Hardware revenue will again decline year-over-year. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS between US$19.95 billion to US$20.15 billion, including approximately $700 million from purchase accounting, integration, and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. We expect operating expense of US$15.2 billion to US$15.3 billion, including approximately $200 million from purchase accounting, integration, and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Other income and expense should be roughly negative $650 million driven by losses on investments accounted for under the equity method as interest income will be mostly offset by interest expense. As a reminder, we are required to recognize gains or losses on our equity investments, which can increase quarterly volatility. We expect our Q1 effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. In closing, we remain focused on delivering innovations that matter to our global customers of every size. That focus extends to delivering on our financial commitments as well. We delivered operating margin growth of nearly three points year-over-year even as we accelerated our AI investments, completed the Activision acquisition, and had a headwind from the change of useful lives last year. So, as we begin FY2025, we will continue to invest in the cloud and AI opportunity ahead aligned, and if needed adjusted, to the demand signals we see. We are committed to growing our leadership across our commercial cloud and within that, the AI platform, and we feel well positioned as we start FY2025.

Thank you, guys for taking the question and congratulations on another great quarter and really solid overall fiscal year. Right now, there's a industry debate raging around the CapEx requirements around Generative AI and whether the monetization is actually going to match with that. And I think the question for you guys, from a Microsoft perspective, is CapEx still an appropriate leading indicator for cloud growth? Or does the shift in gross margin profile change that equation? Or said another way, maybe can you give us a little bit more help in understanding the timing between the CapEx investments and the yield on those investments?

I think, I would say we primarily start right now from the demand side. What I mean by that is what's the product – shape of the product portfolio, what we learned even from the cloud transition, which, as you know, Keith, was similar in the sense it was both a knowledge-intensive and a capital-intensive transition. We needed to have the product portfolio where there was the right mix of, I'll call it, infrastructure meters as well as SaaS applications. So that's the first thing that we are looking at. And how is that value landing with customers and what's the growth rate. So when I think about what's happening with M365 Copilot as perhaps the best Office 365 or M365 suite we have had, the fact that we're getting recurring customers, so our customers coming back buying more seats. So GitHub Copilot now being bigger than even GitHub when we bought it. What's happening in the contact center with Dynamics. So I would say – and obviously, the Azure AI growth, that's the first place we look at. That then drives bulk of the CapEx spend, basically, that's the demand signal because you got to remember, even in the capital spend, there is land and there is data center build, but 60-plus percent is the kit, that only will be bought for inferencing and everything else if there is demand signal, right? So that's, I think, the key way to think about capital cycle even. The asset, as Amy said, is a long-term asset, which is land and the data center, which, by the way, we don't even construct things fully, we can even have things which are semi-constructed, we call [cold] (ph) shelves and so on. So we know how to manage our CapEx spend to build out a long-term asset and a lot of the hydration of the kit happens when we have the demand signal. There is definitely spend for training. Even there, of course, we will only be scaling training as we see the demand accrue in any given period in time. So I would say it's more important to manage, to capture the opportunity with the right product portfolio that's driving value. And on that front, I feel good about the breadth of Microsoft offering, whether it's in consumer side, whether it's on commercial per seat side or on the consumption meters, that's, I think, the fundamental driver.",435.0,191.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.015706806282722512,0.0,0.005235602094240838,0.0,0.0,0.015706806282722512

Being able to maybe share a little more about that when we talked about roughly half of FY2024's total capital expense as well as half of Q4's expense, it's really on land and build and finance leases, and those things really will be monetized over 15 years and beyond. And they're incredibly flexible because we've built a consistent architecture first with the Commercial Cloud and second with the Azure stack for AI, regardless of whether the demand at the platform layer or at the app layer or through third parties and partners or, frankly, our first-party SaaS, it uses the same infrastructure. So it's long-lived flexible assets. And if you think about it, that way, you can see what we're doing and focused on is building out this network in parallel across the globe. Because when we did this last transition, the first transition to the Cloud, which seems a long time ago sometimes, it rolled out quite differently. We rolled out more geo by geo and this one because we have demand on a global basis. We are doing it on a global basis, which is important. We have large customers in every geo. And so hopefully, with that sort of shape of our capital expense, it helps people see how much of that is sort of near-term monetization driver as well as a much longer duration.",286.0,124.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,0.016129032258064516,0.016129032258064516,0.03225806451612903,0.0,0.0,0.0

GenAI has been a bit of rollercoaster of a tech over the last year with periods of acceleration, high expectations and the expectations drop as reality kicked in. With Azure growth we've seen this quarter and O365 Commercial, not yet fully visible in numbers even though Amy, you gave us a lot of color on it. Two quick parts to the question. Satya, how should we think about what it's going to take for GenAI to become more real across the industry and for it to become more visible within your SaaS offerings? And Amy, with Cloud, it took time for margins to improve. It looks like with AI, it's happening quicker. Can you give us a sense of how you think about the margin impact near-term and long-term from all the investment on AI?

So to me, look, at the end of the day, GenAI is just software. So it is really translating into fundamentally growth on what has been our M365 SaaS offering with a newer offering that is the Copilot SaaS offering, which today is on a growth rate that's faster than any other previous generation of software we launched as a suite in M365. That's, I think, the best way to describe it. I mean the numbers I think we shared even this quarter are indicative of this, Mark. So if you look at it, we have both the landing of the seats itself quarter-over-quarter that is growing 60%, right? That's a pretty good healthy sign. The most healthy sign for me is the fact that customers are coming back there. That is the same customers with whom we landed the seats coming back and buying more seats. And then the number of customers with 10,000-plus seats doubled, right? It's 2x quarter-over-quarter. That, to me, is a healthy SaaS core business. And on top of that, some of the things that Amy shared around Dynamic. That's another exciting place for us, which is one, we are gaining share. We are – Dynamics with the GenAI built-in is sort of really biz app, it's probably the category that gets completely transformed with GenAI. Contact centers being a great example. We ourselves are on course to save hundreds of millions of dollars in our own customer support and contact center operations. I think we can drive that value to our customers. And then on the Azure side, you see the numbers very clearly. In fact, I think last quarter is when we started giving you that. You saw an acceleration of that this quarter. One of the other pieces, Mark, is AI doesn't sit on its own, right? So it's just for – we have a concept of design wins in Azure. So in fact, 50% of the folks who are using Azure AI are also using a data meter. That's very exciting to us because the most important thing in Azure is to win workloads in the enterprise. And that is starting to happen. And these are generational things once they get going with you. So that's, I think, how we think about it at least when I look at what's happening on our demand side.",413.0,165.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.03636363636363636,0.006060606060606061,0.006060606060606061,0.0,0.0,0.030303030303030304

That's primarily for a reason I've mentioned a couple of times. We have a consistent platform. So because we're building to one Azure AI stack, we don't have to have multiple infrastructure investments. We're making one. We're using that internally first-party, and that's what we're using with customers to build on as well as ISVs.

When you look at the CapEx, how do you ring efficiencies out of the CapEx? You've disclosed that 50% of the infrastructure, the other 50% tech, is very useful. So in other words, do you have to keep growing CapEx at these elevated rates? Or could you slow down CapEx and still get that consistent revenue growth rate in your Azure and Generative AI?

There's really two pieces, I think, as I heard your question that I would reflect on. The first is, could we see sort of consistent revenue growth without maybe what you would say is more of this sort of elevated capital expense number or something that continues to accelerate. And the answer to that is yes because there's two different pieces, right? You're seeing half of this go toward long-term builds that Satya mentioned, the pace at which we fill those builds with CPUs or GPUs will be demand-driven. And so if we see differences in demand signal, we can throttle that investment on the CPU side, which we've done for I guess, a long time at this point, as I reflect, and we'll use all that same learning and demand signal understand to do the same thing on the GPU side. And so you're right that you could see relatively consistent revenue patterns and yet see these inconsistencies and capital spend quarter-to-quarter. The other thing, I would note, Kash, is you'll also notice there's a growing distinction between our CapEx number, and on occasion, the cash that we pay for PP&E and you're going to start to see that more often in this period because it happens when we use leases. Leases sort of show up all at once. And so you'll see a little bit more volatility.

I think as people think about capital spend, I think it's important to separate out leases from build. And when it comes to build, I think it's important for us to think about – we think about it in terms of what's the total percentage of cost that goes into each line item, land which obviously has a very different duration and a very different lead time. So those are the other two considerations. We think about lead time and duration of the asset. Land, network, construction, the system or the kit and then the ongoing cost.

Amy, I know when you set your Azure guidance, you're always looking to meet or beat the high-end. The 30% you put up in the June quarter, amazing number given the scale of Azure, but it did come in at the low end of your range. And I'd just love for you to maybe elaborate on the delta. I guess as I reflect on what you said in your comments. There's two things that I heard you say. One, it sounded like there's persistent capacity constraints that you think might get alleviated in the second half? And then secondly, you mentioned perhaps some modest softness in Europe.

In fact, the GitHub design system and the GitHub Copilot workspace design system, which now, for example, you start with an issue, you create a plan, from a plan, you create a spec, or you create a spec and from a spec, you create a plan and then you go operate across the full repo. That's effectively the design system that is getting replicated inside of even the M365 Copilot. And you see this even now – for example, you get an email, you're in sales, you want to respond to the customer. The data from the email is essentially context for a prompt but you expand by bringing in all of your CRM data, right? So this customer email is in the context of some order, all of the CRM record gets completed in context and a reply gets generated with the CRM data. That's the type of stuff that's already happening. Then you take something like Copilot Studio, you can start even grounding it in more data and then completing workflows. So you could say if this email comes from this customer whose order date is got a particular issue with it. You can then go and escalate it to somebody else who gets a notification in Teams. And those are the kinds of workflows that are getting built within IT or by end users themselves, what used to be line of business applications to us are Copilot extensions going forward. So we think of this as really a new design system for knowledge and frontline work to drive productivity, which would be very akin to what has happened in software engineering. So when you think about marketing or finance or sales or customer service, we will effectively replicate what you just said, which is the type of productivity we've seen in developers, will come to all of these functions as they think about their work, workflow and workout effect, all being driven by Copilots.",337.0,155.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.012903225806451613,0.0064516129032258064,0.0,0.0,-0.012903225806451613

I actually wanted to veer towards gaming, if I could, for a second. Xbox content services revenue grew 61%, 58 points held from Activision. So net is about 3 points of growth. How should investors think about the longer-term growth potential in this area? You've made significant investments, including the Activision deal. But how should investors be thinking about the growth potential of the gaming? Or what are the puts and takes to help make considerations here? Thank you.",91.0,46.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.043478260869565216,0.021739130434782608,0.021739130434782608,0.0,0.0,0.021739130434782608

For us, our investment in gaming fundamentally was to have, I would say, the right portfolio of both what we love about gaming and always have loved about gaming, which is Xbox and the content for the console and expand from there so that we have content for everywhere people play games, starting with the PC. So when I think about the Activision portfolio, it comes with great assets for us to cover both the PC and the console. And then, of course, assets to cover mobile sockets, which we never have. So we feel that now we have both the content and the ability to access all the traditional high scale platforms where people play games, which is the console, PC and mobile. But we're also excited about these new sockets, right? I mean the fact that even in this last quarter, we expanded X Cloud to Amazon TV, I forget the name of what it's called. But that's the type of new access that really helps us a lot, get reach new gamers or the same gamer everywhere they want to play. And that ultimately will show up in that software plus services and transaction revenue for us, which is really our long-term KPI, and that's what we're building towards. And that was strategy behind Activision as an asset. Amy, if you want to add to it?",236.0,102.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.00980392156862745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.00980392156862745

With enhanced transactions and the ownership of IP, which is quite valuable long-term. As Satya mentioned, things where with the ownership of IP, it can be monetized in multiple ways. And I think we're really encouraged by some of the progress and how we're making progress with Game Pass as well with some of the new announcements.

We are off to a solid start to our fiscal year, driven by continued strength of Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $38.9 billion in revenue, up 22%. AI-driven transformation is changing work, work artifacts and workflow across every role, function, and business process, helping customers drive new growth and operating leverage. All up, our AI business is on track to surpass an annual revenue run rate of $10 billion next quarter, which will make it the fastest business in our history to reach this milestone. Now I'll highlight examples of our progress starting with infrastructure. Azure took share this quarter. We are seeing continued growth in cloud migration. Azure Arc now has over 39,000 customers across every industry, including American Tower, CTT, L'Oréal, up more than 80% year-over-year. We now have data centers in over 60 regions around the world. And this quarter, we announced new cloud and AI infrastructure investments in Brazil, Italy, Mexico, and Sweden as we expand our capacity in line with our long-term demand signals. At the silicon layer, our new Cobalt 100 VMs are being used by companies like Databricks, Elastic, Siemens, Snowflake, and Synopsys to power their general-purpose workloads at up to 50% better price performance than previous generations. On top of this, we are building out our next-generation AI infrastructure, innovating across the full stack to optimize our fleet for AI workloads. We offer the broadest selection of AI accelerators, including our first-party accelerator, Maia 100 as well as the latest GPUs from AMD and NVIDIA. In fact, we are the first cloud to bring up NVIDIA's Blackwell system with GB200-powered AI servers. Our partnership with OpenAI also continues to deliver results. We have an economic interest in a company that has grown significantly in value, and we have built differentiated IP and are driving revenue momentum. More broadly with Azure AI, we are building an end-to-end app platform to help customers build their own Copilots and agents. Azure OpenAI usage more than doubled over the past six months as both digital natives like Grammarly and Harvey as well as established enterprises like Bajaj Finance, Hitachi, KT, and LG move apps from test to production. GE Aerospace, for example, used Azure OpenAI to build a new digital assistant for all 52,000 of its employees. In just three months, it has been used to conduct over 500,000 internal queries and process more than 200,000 documents. And this quarter, we added support for OpenAI's newest model family, o1. We're also bringing industry-specific models through Azure AI, including a collection of best-in-class multimodal models for medical imaging. And with the GitHub models, we now provide access to our full model catalog directly within the GitHub developer workflow. Azure AI is also increasingly an on-ramp to our data and analytics services. As developers build new AI apps on Azure, we have seen an acceleration of Azure Cosmos DB and Azure SQL DB hyperscale usage as customers like Air India, Novo Nordisk, Telefonica, Toyota Motors North America, and Uniper take advantage of capabilities, purpose-built for AI applications. And with Microsoft Fabric, we provide a single AI-powered platform to help customers like Chanel, EY, KPMG, Swiss Air, and Syndigo unify their data across clouds. We now have over 16,000 paid Fabric customers, over 70% of the Fortune 500. Now on to developers. GitHub Copilot is changing the way the world builds software. Copilot enterprise customers increased 55% quarter-over-quarter as companies like AMD and Flutter Entertainment tailor Copilot to their own code base. And we are introducing the next phase of AI code generation, making GitHub Copilot agentic across the developer workflow. GitHub Copilot Workspace is a developer environment which leverages agents from start to finish so developers can go from spec to plan to code all in natural language. Copilot Auto Fix is an AI agent that helps developers at companies like Asurion and Auto Group fix vulnerabilities in their code over 3x faster than it would take them on their own. We're also continuing to build on GitHub's open platform ethos by making more models available via GitHub Copilot. And we are expanding the reach of GitHub to a new segment of developers introducing GitHub Spark, which enables anyone to build apps in natural language. Already, we have brought generative AI to Power Platform to help customers use low-code, no-code tools to cut costs and development time. To date, nearly 600,000 organizations have used AI-powered capabilities in Power Platform, up 4x year-over-year. Citizen developers at ZF, for example, built apps simply by describing what they need using natural language. And this quarter, we introduced new ways for customers to apply AI to streamline complex workflows with Power Automate. Now on to work. We launched the next wave of Microsoft 365 Copilot innovation last month, bringing together Web, Work, and Pages as the new design system for knowledge work. Pages is the first new digital artifact for the AI age, and it's designed to help you ideate with AI and collaborate with other people. We've also made Microsoft 365 Copilot responses 2x faster and improved response quality by nearly 3x. This innovation is driving accelerated usage, and the number of people using Microsoft 365 daily more than doubled quarter-over-quarter. We are also seeing increased adoption from customers in every industry as they use Microsoft 365 Copilot to drive real business value. Vodafone, for example, will roll out Microsoft 365 Copilot to 68,000 employees after a trial showed that, on average, they save three hours per person per week. And UBS will deploy 50,000 seats in our largest finserve deal to date. And we continue to see enterprise customers coming back to buy more seats. All up, nearly 70% of the Fortune 500 now use Microsoft 365 Copilot, and customers continue to adopt it at a faster rate than any other new Microsoft 365 suite. Copilot is the UI for AI and with Microsoft 365 Copilot, Copilot Studio and Agents and now Autonomous Agents, we have built an end-to-end system for AI business transformation. With Copilot Studio, organizations can build and connect Microsoft 365 Copilot to Autonomous Agents, which then delegate to Copilot when there is an exception. More than 100,000 organizations from Ensure, Standard Bank, and Thomson Reuters, to Virgin Money and Zurich Insurance have used Copilot Studio to date, up over 2x quarter-over-quarter. More broadly, we are seeing AI drive a fundamental change in the business applications market as customers shift from legacy apps to AI-first business processes. Dynamics 365 continues to take share as organizations like Evron, Heineken, and Lexmark chose our apps over other providers. And monthly active users of Copilot across our CRM and ERP portfolio increased over 60% quarter-over-quarter. Our Dynamics 365 contact center is also winning customers like Curry's, Le Creuset, and RXO as it brings generative AI to every customer engagement channel. And just last week, we added 10 out-of-the-box autonomous agents to Dynamics 365 that helps customers automatically qualify sales leads, track suppliers and work hand-in-hand with service reps to resolve issues. We're also bringing AI to industry-specific workflows. One year in, DAX Copilot is now documenting over 1.3 million physician patient encounters each month at over 500 health care organizations like Baptist Medical Group, Baylor Scott & White, Baltimore Medical Center, Novant Health, and Overlake Medical Center. It is showing faster revenue growth than GitHub Copilot did in this first year. And new features extend DAX beyond notes helping physicians automatically draft referrals after visit instructions and diagnostic evidence. On top of all this AI innovation, Microsoft Teams usage remains at all-time highs as people use it to streamline all their communications. Nearly 75% of our Teams Enterprise customers now buy Premium, Phone, or Rooms. When it comes to Windows, our new class of Copilot+ PCs is winning new customers. They offer best-in-class AI capability, performance, and value. AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm now all support Copilot+ PCs. This quarter, we also introduced new AI experience only available on Copilot+ PCs like Click to Do, which places an interactive overlay over your desktop to suggest next best actions. And as we approach the end of support for Windows 10 a year from now, we are well positioned to transition our customers to Windows 11, ensuring they benefit from enhanced features and security improvements we've introduced over the past few years. Now on to security. We continue to prioritize security above all else. With our Secure Future Initiative, we have dedicated the equivalent of 34,000 full-time engineers to address the highest-priority security tasks. We have made significant progress to better protect tenants' identities, networks, and engineering systems, and we have created new processes to ensure security is prioritized at every level of the Company. And we continue to take what we learn and turn it into innovations across our products. Security Copilot, for example, is being used by companies in every industry, including Clifford Chance, Intesa Sanpaolo, and Shell to perform SecOps tasks faster and more accurately. And we are now helping customers protect their AI deployments too. Customers have used Defender or Discover and secured more than 750,000 gen AI app instances and used Purview to audit over one billion Copilot interactions to meet their compliance obligations. And all up, we continue to take share across all major categories we serve and are consistently recognized by top analysts as a leader in 20 categories, more than any other vendor. Now let me turn to our consumer businesses, starting with LinkedIn. Member growth continues to accelerate with markets in India and Brazil both growing at double digits. We are also seeing record engagement as we introduce new ways for our more than 1 billion members to connect, sell services, get hired, and share knowledge. Our investments in rich formats like video strengthened our leadership in B2B advertising and amplified the value we deliver to our customers. Weekly immersive video views increased 6x quarter-over-quarter, and total video viewership on LinkedIn is up 36% year-over-year. Our AI-powered tools also continue to transform how people sell, learn and hire. In sales, new AI features help every team member perform at the level of top sellers and drive more profitable growth. In Learning, just yesterday, we announced updates to our coaching experience, including personalized career development plans. LinkedIn's first agent hiring assistant will help hirers find qualified candidates faster by tackling the most time-consuming task. Already hirers who use AI Assistant messages see a 44% higher acceptance rate compared to those who don't. And our hiring business continues to take share. Now on to search, advertising, and news. With Copilot, we are seeing the first step towards creating a new AI companion for everyone with new Copilot experience we introduced earlier this month includes a refreshed design and tone along with improved speed and fluency across the web and mobile. And it includes advanced capabilities like voice and vision that make it more delightful and useful and feel more natural. You can both browse and converse with Copilot simultaneously because Copilot sees what you see. More broadly, AI is also transforming search, browsers, and digital advertising, and we continue to take share across Bing and Edge. Bing ex-TAC revenue growth outpaced the search market. Now on to gaming. One year since we closed our acquisition of Activision Blizzard King, we are focused on building a business positioned for long-term growth, driven by higher-margin content and services. You already see this transformation in our results as we diversify the ways that gamers access our content. We set new records for monthly active users in the quarter as more players than ever play our games across devices and on the Xbox platform. Game Pass also set a new Q1 record for total revenue and average revenue per subscriber. And as we look ahead, our IP across our studios has never been stronger. Last week's launch of Black Ops 6 was the biggest Call of Duty release ever, setting a record for day one players as well as Game Pass subscriber ads on launch day. And unit sales on PlayStation and Steam were also up over 60% year-over-year. This speaks to our strategy of meeting gamers where they are by enabling them to play more games across the screens, they spend their time on. In closing, we are rapidly innovating to expand our opportunity across our commercial and consumer businesses. In three weeks' time, we will hold our Ignite conference, and I look forward to sharing more then about how we are helping every business function use AI to drive growth in this new era. With that, let me turn it over to Amy.",2128.0,1137.0,34.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,10.0,5.0,1.0,0.02990325417766051,0.001759014951627089,0.0043975373790677225,0.0008795074758135445,0.0008795074758135445,0.028144239226033423

This quarter, revenue was $65.6 billion, up 16%, and earnings per share was $3.30, an increase of 10%. With strong execution by our sales teams and partners, we delivered a solid start to our fiscal year with double-digit top and bottom-line growth. We also saw continued share gains across many of our businesses. In our commercial business, increased demand and growth in long-term commitments to our Microsoft Cloud platform drove our results. Commercial bookings were ahead of expectations and increased 30% and 23% in constant currency. Results were driven by strong execution across our core annuity sales motions and growth in the number of $10 million-plus contracts for both Azure and Microsoft 365. Additionally, we also saw an increase in the number of $100 million-plus contracts for Azure. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 22% and 21% in constant currency to $259 billion. Roughly 40% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 17% year-over-year. The remaining portion, recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 27%. And this quarter, our annuity mix increased to 98%. In addition to commercial results that were in line with expectations, we also saw some benefit from in-period revenue recognition across Microsoft 365 commercial, Azure, and our on-premises server business. At a company level, Activision contributed a net impact of approximately 3 points to revenue growth, with a 2-point drag on operating income growth and had a negative $0.05 impact to earnings per share. A reminder that this net impact includes adjusting for the movement of Activision content from our prior relationship as a third-party partner to first-party and includes $911 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration, and transaction-related costs. FX did not have a significant impact on our results and was roughly in line with expectations on total company revenue, segment-level revenue, COGS, and operating expense growth. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $38.9 billion and grew 22%, roughly in line with expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased 2 points year-over-year to 71%. This was slightly better than expected due to improvement in Azure, although the gross margin percentage decrease year-over-year continues to be driven by scaling our AI infrastructure. Company gross margin dollars increased 13% and 14% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage was 69%, down 2 points year-over-year, driven by the lower Microsoft Cloud gross margin noted earlier as well as the impact from purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Operating expenses increased 12%, lower than expected due to our focus on cost efficiencies and ongoing prioritization work. Operating expense growth included 9 points from the Activision acquisition. At a total company level, headcount at the end of September was 8% higher than a year ago. Excluding the growth of the Activision acquisition, headcount was 2% higher. Operating income increased 14% and operating margins were 47%, down 1 point year-over-year. Excluding the net impact from the Activision acquisition, operating margins were up 1 point as we continue to drive efficiencies across our businesses as we invest in AI infrastructure and capabilities. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $28.3 billion and grew 12% and 13% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected results across all businesses. M365 commercial cloud revenue increased 15% and 16% in constant currency with business trends that were as expected. The better-than-expected result was due to a small benefit from the in-period revenue recognition noted earlier. ARPU growth was primarily driven by E5 as well as M365 Copilot. Paid M365 commercial seats grew 8% year-over-year with installed base expansion across all customer segments. Seat growth was driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings. M365 commercial cloud revenue represents nearly 90% of total M365 commercial products and cloud services. M365 commercial products revenue increased 2% and 3% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, primarily due to the benefit from in-period revenue recognition noted earlier. M365 consumer products and cloud services revenue increased 5% and 6% in constant currency. M365 consumer cloud revenue increased 6% and 7% in constant currency, with continued momentum in M365 consumer subscriptions, which grew 10% to 84.4 million. M365 consumer cloud revenue represents 85% of total M365 consumer products and cloud services. LinkedIn revenue increased 10% and 9% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations with growth across all lines of business. Dynamics revenue grew 14%, driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 18% and 19% in constant currency with continued growth across all workloads and continued share gains. As a reminder, Dynamics 365 represents about 90% of total Dynamics revenue. Segment gross margin dollars increased 11% and 12% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year, driven by scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 2% and operating income increased 16%. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $24.1 billion, increasing 20% and 21% in constant currency, in line with expectations. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 33% and 34% in constant currency, with healthy consumption trends that were in line with expectations. The better-than-expected result was due to the small benefit from in-period revenue recognition noted earlier. Azure growth included roughly 12 points from AI services, similar to last quarter. Demand continues to be higher than our available capacity. Non-AI growth trends were also in line with expectations in total and across regions as customers continued to migrate and modernize on the Azure platform. The non-AI point contribution to Azure growth was sequentially lower by approximately 1 point. In our on-premises server business, revenue decreased 1%. Lower-than-expected transactional purchasing ahead of the Windows Server 2025 launch as well as lower purchasing of licenses running a multi-cloud environment was mostly offset by the benefit from in-period revenue recognition noted earlier. Enterprise and partner services revenue decreased 1% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars increased 15%, and gross margin percentage decreased 3 points year-over-year, driven by scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 8% and operating income grew 18%. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue of $13.2 billion increasing 17% with 15 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Results were above expectations, driven by gaming and search. Windows OEM and devices revenue increased 2% year-over-year as better-than-expected results in Windows OEM due to mix shift to higher monetizing markets was partially offset by the lower-than-expected results in devices due to execution challenges in the commercial segment. Search and news advertising revenue ex-TAC increased 18% and 19% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, primarily due to continued execution improvement. We saw rate expansion in addition to healthy volume growth in both Edge and Bing. And in gaming, revenue increased 43% and 44% in constant currency with 43 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Results were ahead of expectations, driven by stronger-than-expected performance in both first- and third-party content as well as consoles. Xbox content and services revenue increased 61% with 53 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Segment gross margin dollars increased 16% and 17% in constant currency with 12 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged year-over-year. Our strong execution on margin improvement in gaming and search was offset by sales mix shift to those businesses. Operating expenses increased 49% with 51 points from the Activision acquisition. Operating income decreased 4%. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $20 billion, in line with expectations, and cash paid for PP&E was $14.9 billion. Roughly half of our cloud and AI-related spend continues to be for long-lived assets that will support monetization over the next 15 years and beyond. The remaining cloud and AI spend is primarily for servers, both CPUs and GPUs, to serve customers based on demand signals. Cash flow from operations was $34.2 billion, up 12%, driven by strong cloud billings and collections, partially offset by higher supplier employee and tax payments. Free cash flow was $19.3 billion, down 7% year-over-year, reflecting higher capital expenditures to support our cloud and AI offerings. This quarter, other income expense was negative $283 million, significantly more favorable than anticipated due to foreign currency remeasurement and net gains on investments. Our losses on investments accounted for under the equity method were as expected. Our effective tax rate was approximately 19%. And finally, we returned $9 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Now moving to our Q2 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S. dollar basis. First, FX. With the weaker U.S. dollar and assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to increase total revenue and segment level revenue growth by less than 1 point. We expect FX to have no meaningful impact to COGS or operating expense growth. Our outlook has many of the trends we saw in Q1 continue through Q2. Customer demand for our differentiated solutions should drive another quarter of strong growth. In commercial bookings, we expect strong growth on a growing expiry base driven by increased long-term commitments to our platform and strong execution across core annuity sales motions. As a reminder, larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, can drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be roughly 70%, down year-over-year, driven by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure. We expect capital expenditures to increase on a sequential basis, given our cloud and AI demand signals. As I said last quarter, we will stay aligned and, if needed, adjust to the demand signals we see. As a reminder, there can be quarterly spend variability from cloud infrastructure build-outs and the timing of delivery of finance leases. Next, segment guidance, starting with Productivity and Business Processes. We are the market leader when it comes to knowledge-based Copilots and agents in the enterprise space, and we are focused on continuing to gain share across our productivity solutions. Therefore, we expect revenue in Productivity and Business Processes to grow between 10% and 11% in constant currency or $28.7 billion to $29 billion. M365 commercial cloud revenue growth should be approximately 14% in constant currency with moderating seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5 and M365 Copilot. For H2, we expect revenue growth to remain relatively stable compared to Q2. We continue to see growth in M365 Copilot seats, and we expect the related revenue to continue to grow gradually over time. For M365 commercial products, we expect revenue to decline in the low single digits. As a reminder, M365 commercial products include on-premises components of M365 suites. So, our quarterly revenue growth can have variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. M365 consumer cloud revenue growth should be in the mid-single digits driven by M365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth of approximately 10%, driven by continued growth across all businesses. And in Dynamics 365, we expect revenue growth to be in the mid- to high teens, driven by continued growth across all workloads. Next, Intelligent Cloud. Helping our customers transform and grow with innovative cloud and AI solutions is driving continued growth in Azure. Therefore, we expect revenue in Intelligent Cloud to grow between 18% and 20% in constant currency or $25.55 billion to $25.85 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q2 revenue growth to be 31% to 32% in constant currency, driven by strong demand for our portfolio of services. We expect consumption growth to be stable compared to Q1, and we expect to add more sequential dollars to Azure than any other quarter in history. We expect the contribution from AI services to be similar to last quarter, given the continued capacity constraints as well as some capacity that shifted out of Q2. And in H2, we still expect Azure growth to accelerate from H1 as our capital investments create an increase in available AI capacity to serve more of the growing demand. And in our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline in the low to mid-single digits on a prior year comparable that benefited from purchasing ahead of Windows Server 2012 end of support. And in Enterprise and partner services, we expect revenue growth to be in the low single digits. Now to More Personal Computing. We continue to make decisions to prioritize strategic higher-margin opportunities within each of our consumer businesses. Our outlook reflects the improvement in gross and operating margins from this prioritization work across gaming, search, and devices. We expect revenue in More Personal Computing to be $13.85 billion to $14.25 billion. Windows OEM and devices revenue should decline in the low to mid-single digits. We expect Windows OEM revenue growth in line with the PC market to be more than offset by a decline in devices as the trends from Q1 continue. Search and news advertising ex-TAC revenue growth should be in the high teens, with continued growth in both volume and revenue per search. This will be higher than overall search and news advertising revenue growth, which we expect to be in the high single digits. And in gaming, we expect revenue to decline in the high single digits due to hardware. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth to be relatively flat. We're excited about last week's launch of Call of Duty, where we saw the most Game Pass subscriber adds we've ever seen on a launch day. There are two things about the launch that are different than the Call of Duty launch a year ago, where revenue was mostly recognized in the quarter of purchase. First, the game is available on Game Pass so for players who play through Game Pass, the subscription revenue is recognized over time. Second, the game requires an online connection to play so even for players who purchased the standalone game, revenue recognition will also occur ratably over time. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS to grow between 11% and 13% in constant currency or to be between $21.9 billion to $22.1 billion, and operating expense to grow approximately 7% in constant currency or to be between $16.4 billion and $16.5 billion. This should result in another quarter of operating margin expansion. Other income and expense is expected to be roughly negative $1.5 billion, primarily driven by our share of the expected loss from OpenAI, which is accounted for under the equity method. As a reminder, we do not recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on equity method investments. As you heard from Satya, our strategic partnership and investment in OpenAI has been pivotal in building and scaling our AI business and positioning us as the leader in the AI platform wave. And lastly, we expect our Q2 effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. In closing, we remain focused on strategically investing in the long-term opportunities that we believe drive shareholder value. Monetization from these investments continues to grow, and we're excited that only 2.5 years in, our AI business is on track to surpass $10 billion of annual revenue run rate in Q2. This will be the fastest business in our history to reach this milestone. We are committed to growing this leadership position across our entire Microsoft Cloud while maintaining our disciplined focus on cost management and prioritization across every team. With that, let's go to Q&A, Brett.",2541.0,1470.0,38.0,16.0,25.0,8.0,8.0,7.0,3.0,4.0,0.02585034013605442,0.010884353741496598,0.017006802721088437,0.005442176870748299,0.005442176870748299,0.014965986394557823

So, Satya, the expansion of capabilities, the speed of innovation, the magnitude of the opportunities ahead for generative AI makes this the most exciting period for software I've seen in my 25 years of covering this space. And based upon this call, it seems like you share that excitement. But in my investor conversation, that excitement also feeds two related questions, and they both have to do with constraints. And the first is like what are the internal constraints or guardrails that Microsoft has when it comes to investing behind these innovations, particularly in relation to the funding of future generations of foundational models, where people were talking about price tags, you want to spend the tens of billions or even $100 billion-plus? And then on the other side of the spectrum, what are the external constraints that Microsoft sees in building out this capacity to meet the demand and capture the opportunity, particularly constraints in your ability to power all these new data centers being built out and powered in an environmentally sustainable fashion? I'd love to get the Microsoft perspective on both those questions.",193.0,90.0,7.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07777777777777778,0.022222222222222223,0.011111111111111112,0.0,0.044444444444444446,0.05555555555555555

I think on the first point, ultimately, when you think about, let's say, capital outlay for training because that's essentially what you're asking, it is going to be rate limited by your monetization of inference, given generation, right? So just like in the past, we would allocate capital to build out cloud based on the demand signal we were seeing and then we would then project the demand, and that's what we would build for. So, you can think of training essentially as that, right, which is you're building the next-generation model so that then you have a more capable model that then drives more inference demand, right? So ultimately, even with all the scaling laws and what have you, I think you ultimately will normalize to having a pace. In fact, I think the best way to think about even is given that Moore's Law effectively is working on the sort of silicon and system size, so it's just not compute, right, it's efficiencies in compute, it's data as well as algorithms. You will want to sort of keep on that curve, which is you really want to refresh your fleet with the Moore's Law every year and then effectively depreciate it over the period of the life cycle of it. And then the inference demand ultimately will cover how much we invest in training because that's, I think, at the end of the day, you're all subject to ultimately demand. So, the second piece of the external constraints, we have run into, obviously, lots of external constraints because this demand all showed up pretty fast, right? I mean, if you think about even the most hit product of this generation all are in our cloud, right, whether it's ChatGPT, whether it's Copilot, whether it's GitHub Copilot or even DAX Copilot, I mean, pick the top four or five products of this generation, they're all sort of in and around our ecosystem. And so therefore, we ran into a set of constraints, which are everything because DCs don't get built overnight. So, there is DCs, there is power. And so that's sort of been the short-term constraint. Even in Q2, for example, some of the demand issues we have or our ability to fulfill demand is because of, in fact, external third-party stuff that we leased moving up. So that's the constraints we have. But in the long run, we do need effectively power and we need DCs. And some of these things are more long lead. But I feel pretty good that going into the second half of even this fiscal year, that some of that supply/demand will match up.",471.0,207.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.014492753623188406,0.004830917874396135,0.0,0.014492753623188406,0.024154589371980676,0.00966183574879227

Maybe this is a great question because I can sort of reiterate some of the points I made and tie them together a little bit. In Q1, the 34% in CC, as we talked about, that upside versus the 33% that we had guided to was primarily due to some revenue recognition benefits. And so, I think about that on a sort of a pure consumption basis and AI as being 33%. And you think about 1 point or 2 of decel that we've guided to, and the majority of that is due to, unfortunately, some supply pushouts that I mentioned and then Satya reiterated in terms of AI supply coming online that we counted on. The underlying consumption growth is stable Q1 to Q2. And so, to your question on some ins and outs, it is certainly some ins and outs. I do, as you heard, have confidence as we get a good influx of supply across the second half of the year, particularly on the AI side that we'll be better able to do some supply-demand matching and hence, while we're talking about acceleration in the back half. I'll also take the opportunity to say, when you see usage in AI workloads, we always intend to think about that as just a GPU exercise. The importance of having GPUs and CPUs be able to run these workloads is also important. So that's a piece of the acceleration in H2 as well.",246.0,94.0,6.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.06382978723404255,0.031914893617021274,0.010638297872340425,0.0,0.0,0.031914893617021274

The question every investor obviously asks is a question on the CapEx growth and the CapEx spend. Obviously, half of that facility is an equivalent that have a longer life, but the other half is the rest of the components. Can you give any color on how you think of that growth? Does it return to the traditional approach, where basically CapEx is going to grow in line or slightly slower than cloud revenue? And if so, any sense of the timing?

I think in some ways, it's helpful to go back to the cloud transition that we worked on over a decade ago, I think, in the early stages. And what you did see and you'll see us do in the same time is you have to build to meet demand. Unlike the cloud transition, we're doing it on a global basis in parallel as opposed to sequential, given the nature of the demand. And then as long as we continue to see that demand grow, you're right, the growth in CapEx will slow and the revenue growth will increase. And those two things, to your point, get closer and closer together over time. The pace of that entirely depends really on the pace of adoption. And to Satya's point, some of that spend goes towards building the next training infrastructure so you won't see all of it in COGS. Some of it goes to OpEx when you're spending it on training. But in general, that's a healthy way to think about the balance as that over time those do and should like the last cycle get closer together.",198.0,90.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.022222222222222223,0.011111111111111112,0.0,0.011111111111111112,-0.022222222222222223

Since the print three months ago, we investors have been hit with a torrent of media stories about OpenAI and Microsoft. And I'd love to give Microsoft an opportunity to frame the relationship. It seems to me it's critically important. But we have been, I think, everyone on the line picking up signals that perhaps Microsoft wants to diversify somewhat at the model layer and offer customers choice. So, Satya, I'd love to get your framing of the relationship. And then in terms of the numbers, maybe this is a little bit more for you, Amy, but how does Microsoft manage the demands on CapEx from helping OpenAI with its scaling ambitions?

So, I'd say first, the partnership for both sides, that's OpenAI and Microsoft, has been super beneficial. After all, we effectively sponsored what is one of the most highest-valued private companies today when we invested in them and really took a bet on them and their innovation four, five years ago. And that has led to great success for Microsoft. That's led to great success for OpenAI. And we continue to build on it, right? So, we serve them with world-class infrastructure on which they do their innovation in terms of models, on top of which we innovate on both the model layer with some of the post-training stuff we do as well as some of the small models we build. And then, of course, all of the product innovation, right? One of the things that my own sort of conviction of OpenAI and what they were doing came about when I started seeing something like GitHub Copilot as a product get built or DAX Copilot get built or M365 Copilot get built. So, we have a fantastic portfolio of innovation that we build on top of that. And the same also, I would say, we are investors. We feel very, very good about sort of our investment stake in OpenAI. And so, our focus, and we're always in constant dialogue with them in a partnership like this where both sides have achieved mutual success at the pace at which we've achieved it, that means we need to kind of push each other to do more, to capture the moment and that's what we plan to do, and we intend to keep building on it.",287.0,112.0,13.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.11607142857142858,0.008928571428571428,0.0,0.017857142857142856,0.0,0.10714285714285714

It's important that we continue to invest capital to meet not only their demand signal and needs for compute but also from our broader customers. That's partially why you've seen us committing the amount of capital we've seen over the past few quarters is our commitment to both grow together and for us to continue to grow the Azure platform for customers beyond them. And so, I don't really think of it as how do you balance it. It's just we have customers who have needs and real use cases and delivering value today. And if we can't meet that, we need to work to meet it. And that means working harder and faster to make sure we do that, which is what the team is committed to do. Second piece of your question, I think, was on the impact to other income. And not to get too accounting-heavy on the earnings phone call, but I would say just a reminder, this is under the equity method, which means we just take our percentage of losses every quarter. And those losses, of course, are capped by the amount of investment we make in total, which we did talk about in the Q this quarter as being $13 billion. And so over time, that's just the constraint and it's a bit of a mechanical entry. And so, I don't really think about managing that.

If you sort of think about the point, we even made that this is going to be the fastest growth to $10 billion of any business in our history, it's all inference, right? One of the things that may not be as evident is that we're not actually selling raw GPUs for other people to train. In fact, that's sort of a business we turn away because we have so much demand on inference that we are not taking what I would -- in fact, there's a huge adverse selection problem today where people -- it's just a bunch of tech companies still using VC money to buy a bunch of GPUs. We kind of really are not even participating in most of that because we are literally going to the real demand, which is in the enterprise space or our own products like GitHub Copilot or M365 Copilot.

You should think of that as the spectrum of things, right? So ultimately, the way we think about how this all comes together is you need humans to be able to interface with AI. So, the UI layer for AI is Copilot. You can then use Copilot Studio to extend Copilot. For example, you want to connect it to your CRM system, to your office system, to your HR system. You do that through Copilot Studio by building agents effectively. You also build autonomous agents. So, you can use even that's the announcement we made a couple of weeks ago is you can even use Copilot Studio to build autonomous agents. Now these autonomous agents are working independently, but from time to time, they need to raise an exception, right? So autonomous agents are not fully autonomous because at some point, they need to either notify someone or have someone input something. And when they need to do that, they need a UI layer and that's where again, it's Copilot. So, Copilot, Copilot agents built-in Copilot Studio, autonomous agents built in Copilot Studio, that's the full system we think that comes together, and we feel very, very good about the position. And then, of course, we are taking the underlying system services across that entire stack that I just talked about, making it available in Azure, right? So, you have the raw infrastructure if you want it. You have the model layer independent of it. You have the AI app server in Azure AI, right? So, everything is also a building block service in Azure for you to be able to build. In fact, if you want to build everything that we have built in the Copilot stack, you can build it yourself using the AI platform. So that's sort of, in simple terms, our strategy, and that's kind of how it all comes together.",336.0,151.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.019867549668874173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.019867549668874173

How we should be thinking about kind of numbers here with the recategorization? It seems like that was maybe softer in the past than expected or maybe with the numbers this quarter starting to pick up. Can you maybe walk us through what you're seeing on that? And maybe more importantly, how we should be thinking about your overall AI strategy on consumer versus enterprise, especially now with the stock on the fold?",85.0,36.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1388888888888889,0.0,0.0,0.0

On the first part, Rishi, to your question, I think we feel very, very good about the momentum we have in the commercial Copilot, right? As I said in my remarks and Amy talked about, this is the fastest growth of a new suite in M365. If I compare it to what we saw even way back in E3 or E5 or the transition from O to M, this is really much faster, right? It's the numbers of penetration of the Fortune 500 and then the fact that they're coming back for more seats and what have you. So, it's very strong in that context. The other thing I'd like to mention is that we want this to be something that is systemic, right, because people need to be able to put the security controls, then they need to deploy, then there's skilling and then there's change management. So, this is not like you just -- it's not a tool like when I talk about Copilot, Copilot Studio, agents. It's really as much about a new way to work. And sometimes I describe it as what happened throughout the '90s with PC penetration. After all, if you take a business process like forecasting, what was it like pre e-mail and Excel and post e-mail and Excel, that's the type of change that you see with Copilot. But overall, we feel great about the rate of progress and the penetration. And then on the consumer side, look, for us, the exciting part here is to be able to use the same investment we are making in the commercial where we have structural strength and then beyond the offense. One of the things that I think I hope you all catch in our earnings is ex-TAC, our revenue, when it comes to what we describe as search, news and ads, is growing faster than market. So, it's fantastic to see that. And so that's kind of our consumer business, which in Microsoft's large scope, it's sort of even a $10-plus billion business or sometimes go missing. But in our case, it is actually a fantastic growth business that's growing faster than market. We feel good about how we will use AI in LinkedIn. In fact, LinkedIn is a consumer business as you know. You saw even this week, they announced some new capabilities for both consumers and, in their case, even recruiting. So, we think that AI, the same investment gets monetized even through LinkedIn's innovation. And gaming, of course, is another place where you'll see some of these things apply. And Windows, right? So, the place where I think I'm excited about is Copilot+ PCs. For us, it's not about having a disconnected edge. It's about having hybrid AI where the rebirth of sort of the PC as the edge of AI is going to be one of the most exciting things for developers. So, we feel well positioned, quite frankly, with the same investment. So, this is -- that's the thing. We're not a conglomerate here. We are sort of one company. That means we invest once and then we have all these categories that benefit from that, and that's the theory of the firm for us. And so, we feel good about all of that coming together.",571.0,220.0,14.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.06363636363636363,0.004545454545454545,0.00909090909090909,0.004545454545454545,0.0,0.05909090909090909

In that M365 commercial number, we've seen that seat growth but those seats that we're adding, the majority of them are driven by frontline worker and small businesses. Those have a lower ARPU point. And so, it masks some of the ARPU that we're already seeing not just from E5, which continues to contribute, but also this quarter, additional impact from Copilot. So, as we go forward, being able -- that is where you're going to see the impact will be in ARPU and M365 commercial, as Satya said, I think you'll see the impact of Copilot engagement, frankly, across the same ex-TAC number.",161.0,66.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.030303030303030304,0.015151515151515152,0.015151515151515152,0.0,0.0,0.015151515151515152

MSFT,2025-01-29,2025-01-30,,2025-01-29,2025-01-29T17:30:00-05:00,0,2025-01-29,prepared,,Satya Nadella,"Thank you, Brett. This quarter we saw continued strength in Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $40 billion in revenue for the first time, up 21% year-over-year. Enterprises are beginning to move from proof-of-concepts to enterprise-wide deployments to unlock the full ROI of AI. And our AI business has now surpassed an annual revenue run rate of $13 billion up 175% year-over-year. Before I get into the details of the quarter, I want to comment on the core thesis behind our approach to how we manage our fleet and how we allocate our capital to compute. AI scaling laws are continuing to compound across both pre-training and inference time compute. We ourselves have been seeing significant efficiency gains in both training and inference for years now. On inference, we have typically seen more than 2x price performance gain for every hardware generation and more than 10x for every model generation due to software optimizations. And as AI becomes more efficient and accessible, we will see exponentially more demand. Therefore, much as we have done with the Commercial Cloud, we are focused on continuously scaling our fleet globally and maintaining the right balance across training and inference as well as geo distribution. From now on it's a more continuous cycle governed by both revenue growth and capability growth, thanks to the compounding effects of software driven AI scaling laws and Moore's Law. With that, I will walk through the progress we are making across every layer of the tech stack. Azure is the infrastructure layer for AI. We continue to expand our data center capacity in line with both near-term and long-term demand signals. We have more than doubled our overall data center capacity in the last three years and we have added more capacity last year than any other year in our history. Our data centers, networks, racks and silicon are all coming together as a complete system to drive new efficiencies to power both the cloud workloads of today and the next generation AI workloads. We continue to take advantage of Moore's Law and refresh our fleet as evidenced by our support of the latest from AMD, Intel, NVIDIA as well as our first-party silicon innovation from Maia, Cobalt, Boost and HSM. When it comes to cloud migrations, we continue to see customers like UBS move workloads to Azure. UBS alone migrated mainframe workloads encompassing nearly 400 billion records and 2 petabytes of data. And we remain the cloud of choice for customers' mission-critical Oracle, SAP and VMware apps. At the data layer, we are seeing Microsoft Fabric breakout. We now have over 19,000 paid customers from Hitachi to Johnson Controls to Schaeffler. Fabric is now the fastest growing analytics product in our history. Power BI is also deeply integrated with Fabric with over 30 million monthly active users, up 40% since last year. Beyond Fabric, we are seeing new AI-driven data patterns emerge. If you look underneath ChatGPT or Copilot or Enterprise AI apps, you see the growth of raw storage, database services and app platform services as these workloads scale. The number of Azure OpenAI apps running on Azure databases and Azure app services more than doubled year-over-year driving significant growth and adoption across SQL Hyperscale and Cosmos DB. Now on to AI platform and tools, as we shared last week we are thrilled OpenAI has made a new large Azure commitment. Through our strategic partnership we continue to benefit mutually from each other's growth and with OpenAI's APIs exclusively running on Azure customers can count on us to get access to the world's leading models and OpenAI has a lot more coming soon, so stay tuned. Azure AI Foundry features best-in-class tooling, run times to build agents, multi-agent apps, AI ops, API access to thousands of models. Two months in, we already have more than 200,000 monthly active users and we are well positioned with our support of both OpenAI's leading models and the best selection of Open Source models and SLMs. DeepSeek's R1 launched today via the model catalog on Foundry and GitHub with automated red teaming, content safety integration and security scanning. Our Phi family of SLMs has now been downloaded over 20 million times and we also have more than 30 models from partners like Bayer, Paige.AI, Rockwell Automation, Siemens to address industry specific use cases. With AI, how we build, deploy and maintain code is fundamentally changing. And GitHub Copilot is increasingly the tool of choice for both digital natives like ASOS and Spotify as well as world's largest enterprises like HP, HSBC and KPMG. We've been delighted by the early response to GitHub Copilot and VS Code with more than a million sign ups in just the first week post launch. All up GitHub now is home to 150 million developers up 50% over the past two years. Now on to the future of work. Microsoft 365 Copilot is the UI for AI. It helps supercharge employee productivity and provides access to a swarm of intelligent agents to streamline employee workflow. We are seeing accelerated customer adoption across all deal sizes as we win new Microsoft 365 Copilot customers and see the majority of existing enterprise customers come back to purchase more seats. When you look at customers who purchased Copilot during the first quarter of availability, they have expanded their seats collectively by more than 10x over the past 18 months. To share just one example, Novartis has added thousands of seats each quarter over the past year and now have 40,000 seats. Barclays, Carrier Group, Pearson and University of Miami all purchased 10,000 or more seats this quarter. And overall the number of people who use Copilot daily again more than doubled quarter-over-quarter. Employees are also engaging with Copilot more than ever. Usage intensity increased more than 60% quarter-over-quarter and we are expanding our TAM with Copilot Chat which was announced earlier this month. Copilot Chat along with Copilot Studio is now available to every employee to start using agents right in the flow of work. With Copilot Studio, we are making it as simple to build an agent as it is to create an Excel spreadsheet. More than 160,000 organizations have already used Copilot Studio and they collectively created more than 400,000 custom agents in the last three months alone up over 2x quarter-over-quarter. We've also introduced our own first-party agents to facilitate meetings, manage projects, resolve common HR and IT queries and access SharePoint data. And we also continue to see partners like Adobe, SAP, ServiceNow and Workday build their third-party agents and integrate with Copilot. What is driving Copilot as the UI for AI as well as our momentum with agents is our rich data cloud which is the world's largest source of organizational knowledge. Billions of emails, documents and chats, hundreds of millions of teams meetings and millions of SharePoint sites are added each day. This is the Enterprise Knowledge Cloud. It is growing fast up over 25% year-over-year. More broadly what we are seeing is Copilot plus agents disrupting business applications and we are leaning into this. With Dynamics 365, we took share as organizations like Ecolab, Lenovo, RTX, Total Energies, and Vizient switched to our AI powered apps from legacy providers. In Healthcare, DAX Copilot surpassed 2 million monthly physician patient encounters up 54% quarter-over-quarter. It is being used by top providers like Mass General Brigham, Michigan Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center to increase productivity of their physicians. When it comes to Windows, we are seeing momentum build as we approach end of support for Windows 10. Customers are choosing the latest Windows 11 devices for their enhanced security and advanced AI capabilities. 15% of premium priced laptops in the US this holiday were Copilot+ PCs and we expect the majority of the PCs sold in the next several years to be Copilot+ PCs. We also see more and more developments from Adobe and CapCut to WhatsApp build apps that leverage built-in NPUs. And they will soon be able to run DeepSeek's R1 distilled models locally on Copilot+ PCs as well as the vast ecosystem of GPUs available on Windows. And beyond Copilot+ PCs the most powerful AI workstation for local development is a Windows PC running WSL 2 powered by NVIDIA RTX GPUs. Now on to Security. We continue to make progress with our Secure Future initiative and we are applying what we have learned introducing over 80 new product capabilities over the past year. With Security Copilot organizations across private and public sector like City of Johannesburg, Eastman, Intesa, National Australia Bank, NTT can resolve incidents 30% faster. Data governance is increasingly critical and customers now use Microsoft Purview to audit over 2 billion Copilot interactions for safe and compliant use. Now on to our consumer businesses starting with LinkedIn. More professionals than ever are engaging in high value conversations on LinkedIn with comments up 37% year-over-year. Short form video continues to grow on the platform with video creation all up growing at twice the rate of other post formats. We're also innovating with agents to help recruiters and small businesses find qualified candidates faster and our hiring business again took share. In subscriptions, LinkedIn premiums surpassed $2 billion in annual revenue for the first time this quarter. Subscriber growth has increased nearly 50% over the past two years and nearly 40% of subscribers have used our AI features to improve their profiles. And LinkedIn marketing solution remains the leader in B2B advertising. Now on to Search Advertising and News. We once again took share across Bing and Edge. Edge surpassed 30% market share in the US on Windows and has taken share for 15 consecutive quarters. The investments we have made in improving our ad rates are paying off and advertisers increasingly see our network as an essential platform to optimize ROI. And our Copilot consumer app is seeing increased engagement and retention with its improved speed, unique personality, first of its kind features like Copilot Vision. Just today we made Think Deeper powered by o1, free for all Copilot users globally. Now on to gaming, we are focused on improving the profitability of the business in order to position it for long-term growth driven by higher margin content and platform services and we are delivering on this plan. Black Ops 6 was top selling game on Xbox and PlayStation this quarter and saw more players in its launch quarter than any other paid release in the franchise history. And we saw rave reviews of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle which has already been played by more than 4 million people. We also continue to see strong momentum for Xbox Cloud Gaming with a record 140 million hours streamed this quarter. All-up Game Pass set a new quarterly record for revenue and grew its PC subscriber base by over 30% as we focus on driving fully paid subscribers across endpoints. In closing, we continue to innovate across our tech stack to help our customers in this AI era and I'm energized by the many opportunities ahead. With that, let me turn it over to Amy.",1863.0,955.0,36.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,0.0,0.03769633507853403,0.0020942408376963353,0.0031413612565445027,0.004188481675392671,0.0010471204188481676,0.0356020942408377

Gross margin dollars increased 13% and 12% in constant currency, while operating income increased 17% and 16% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $3.23 an increase of 10%. We delivered another quarter of double-digit top and bottom line growth. Results were driven by strong demand for our cloud and AI offerings, while we also improved our operating leverage with higher than expected operating income growth. As you heard from Satya, our AI business annual revenue run rate surpassed $13 billion and was above expectations. Commercial bookings increased 67% and 75% in constant currency and were significantly ahead of expectations driven by Azure commitments from OpenAI. Execution was strong across our core annuity sales motions with growth in the number of $100 million plus contracts for both Azure and Microsoft 365. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased to $298 billion, up 34% and 36% in constant currency. Roughly 40% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 21% year-over-year. The remaining portion recognized beyond the next 12 months increased 45%. And this quarter, our annuity mix was 97%. FX did not have a significant impact on our results and was roughly in line with expectations on total company revenue, More Personal Computing revenue, total company COGS, and operating expense. FX decreased revenue more than expected in our commercial segments. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $40.9 billion and grew 21%. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage was 70%, in line with expectations and decreased two points year-over-year driven by scaling our AI infrastructure. Company gross margin percentage increased slightly year-over-year to 69% primarily driven by sales mix shift to higher margin businesses as well as improvement in Gaming and Search, partially offset by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 5%, lower than expected, and operating margins increased two points year-over-year to 45%. The better than expected margin expansion was driven by delivering efficiencies across our businesses as we invest to scale AI infrastructure and build AI applications. At a total company level, headcount at the end of December was 2% higher than a year ago and was relatively unchanged from last quarter. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $29.4 billion and grew 14% and 13% in constant currency even with the unfavorable FX impact noted earlier. Results were ahead of expectations driven by Microsoft 365 Commercial. Microsoft 365 Commercial Cloud revenue increased 16% and 15% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations due to better than expected performance in E5 and Microsoft 365 Copilot. With M365 Copilot, we continue to see growth in adoption, expansion, and usage. ARPU growth was again driven by E5 and M365 Copilot. Paid M365 Commercial seats grew 7% year-over-year with installed base expansion across all customer segments, though primarily in our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings. M365 commercial products revenue increased 13%, significantly ahead of expectations driven by higher than expected transactional purchasing with the launch of Office 2024 as well as the Windows Commercial on-premises components from the better than expected performance of M365 suites noted earlier. M365 Consumer Cloud revenue increased 8%, slightly ahead of expectations. We saw continued momentum in M365 consumer subscriptions which grew 10% to 86.3 million with mix shift to M365 Basic. LinkedIn revenue increased 9% with continued growth across all lines of business. In our Talent Solutions business, results were slightly below expectations driven by continued weakness in the hiring market in key verticals. Dynamics 365 revenue increased 19% and 18% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations with growth across all workloads. Segment gross margin dollars increased 13% and 12% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year driven by scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 6% and operating income increased 16% and 15% in constant currency. Next the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $25.5 billion and grew 19% with more unfavorable FX impact than expected. Excluding the unfavorable FX impact, results in Azure non-AI services, on-prem server, and enterprise and partner services were slightly lower than expected, partially offset by better than expected results in Azure AI services. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 31%. Azure growth included 13 points from AI services, which grew 157% year-over-year and was ahead of expectations even as demand continued to be higher than our available capacity. Growth in our non-AI services was slightly lower than expected due to go-to-market execution challenges, particularly with our customers that we primarily reach through our scale motions, as we balance driving near-term non-AI consumption with AI growth. In our on-premises server business, revenue decreased 3%, slightly below expectations driven by slower than expected purchasing around Windows Server 2025 launch. Enterprise and Partner Services revenue decreased 1%, below expectations with lower than expected performance across Enterprise Support Services and Industry Solutions. Segment gross margin dollars increased 12% and 13% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased four points year-over-year driven by scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 10% and operating income grew 14%. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $14.7 billion, relatively unchanged year-over-year with better than expected results driven primarily by Windows OEM pre-builds, usage from a third-party partnership in Search, as well as Call of Duty launch performance in Gaming. Windows OEM and Devices revenue increased 4% year-over-year, ahead of expectations, driven by commercial inventory builds in advance of Windows 10 end of support as well as uncertainty around tariffs. Search and News advertising revenue ex-TAC increased 21% and 20% in constant currency, ahead of expectations driven by usage from a third-party partnership. Growth continues to be driven by rate expansion and healthy volume growth in both Edge and Bing. And in Gaming, revenue decreased 7% and 8% in constant currency as content and services growth continued to be offset by hardware declines. Xbox content and services revenue increased 2%, ahead of expectations driven by stronger than expected performance in Blizzard and Activision content, including Call of Duty. Segment gross margin dollars increased 13% and 12% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage increased six points year-over-year driven by sales mix shift to higher margin businesses as well as strong execution on margin improvement in Gaming and Search. Operating expenses decreased 1%. Operating income increased 32% and 30% in constant currency driven by continued prioritization of higher margin opportunities. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures including finance leases were $22.6 billion, in line with expectations, and cash paid for PP&E was $15.8 billion. More than half of our cloud and AI related spend was on long-lived assets that will support monetization over the next 15 years and beyond. The remaining cloud and AI spend was primarily for servers, both CPUs and GPUs, to serve customers based on demand signals including our customer contracted backlog. Cash flow from operations was $22.3 billion, up 18% driven by strong cloud billings and collections, partially offset by higher supplier, employee and tax payments. Free cash flow was $6.5 billion, down 29% year-over-year, reflecting the capital expenditures noted earlier. This quarter, other income and expense was negative $2.3 billion, lower than our October guidance due to the impairment charge from our Cruise investment. Our effective tax rate came in slightly lower than anticipated at 18%. And finally, we returned $9.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Now, moving to our Q3 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a US dollar basis. First, FX. With the strengthening of the US dollar since October, we now expect FX to decrease total revenue growth by two points. Within the segments, we expect FX to decrease revenue growth by two points in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud and roughly one point in More Personal Computing. When compared to our October guidance assumptions on Q3 FX impact, this is a decrease to total revenue of roughly $1 billion. We expect FX to decrease COGS growth by approximately two points and operating expense growth by approximately one point. Our outlook has many of the trends we saw in Q2 continue through Q3. Demand for our differentiated cloud and AI offerings across the Microsoft Cloud should drive another quarter of strong growth. In Commercial Bookings, with a relatively flat expiry base and a strong prior year comparable in terms of large Azure contracts, we expect growth to be roughly flat year-over-year. We expect consistent execution across our core annuity sales motions and continued long-term commitments to our platform. As a reminder, larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, can drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be roughly 69%, down year-over-year driven by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure. Next to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes we expect revenue to grow between 11% and 12% in constant currency or $29.4 billion to $29.7 billion. Microsoft 365 Commercial Cloud revenue growth should be between 14% and 15% in constant currency, relatively stable compared to our better than expected Q2 results. We expect continued ARPU growth through E5 and M365 Copilot and we again expect some seat growth moderation given the size of the installed base. For M365 Commercial products, we expect revenue to be relatively unchanged year-over-year. As a reminder, M365 Commercial products include Windows Commercial on-premises components of M365 suites, so our quarterly revenue growth can have variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. M365 Consumer Cloud revenue growth should be in the mid to high-single-digits driven by M365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single-digits. Although we expect growth across all businesses, the Q2 trends in Talent Solutions should continue in Q3 as a headwind to growth. And in Dynamics 365, we expect revenue growth to be in the mid-teens driven by continued growth across all workloads. For Intelligent Cloud we expect revenue to grow between 19% and 20% in constant currency or $25.9 billion to $26.2 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q3 revenue growth to be between 31% and 32% in constant currency driven by strong demand for our portfolio of services. As we shared in October, the contribution from our AI services will grow from increased AI capacity coming online. In non-AI services healthy growth continues, although we expect ongoing impact through H2 as we work to address the execution challenges noted earlier. And while we expect to be AI capacity constrained in Q3, by the end of FY25 we should be roughly in line with near-term demand given our significant capital investments. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline in the mid-single-digits driven by a decrease in transactional purchasing. And in Enterprise and Partner services, we expect revenue growth to be in the low to mid-single-digits. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to be $12.4 billion to $12.8 billion with continued prioritization of higher margin opportunities. Windows OEM and Devices revenue should decline in the low to mid-single-digits. We expect revenue from Windows OEM to be relatively flat year-over-year as our outlook assumes inventory levels will normalize. Actual results may differ based on current tariff uncertainties. Devices revenue will decline. Search and News advertising ex-TAC revenue growth should be in the mid-teens from continued growth in both volume and revenue per search with share gains across Edge and Bing. Growth is expected to moderate from last quarter primarily due to additional FX impact and as the third-party partnership usage noted earlier returns to more normal levels. Search ex-TAC growth will be higher than overall Search and News advertising revenue growth, which we expect to be in the mid to high-single-digits. And in Gaming, we expect revenue growth to be in the low-single-digits. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth to be in the low to mid-single-digits driven by first-party content as well as Xbox Game Pass. Hardware revenue will decline year-over-year. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS to grow between 19% and 20% in constant currency or to be between $21.65 billion to $21.85 billion and operating expense to grow between 5% and 6% in constant currency or to be between $16.4 billion and $16.5 billion. Other income and expense is expected to be roughly negative $1 billion primarily driven by investments accounted for under the equity method. As a reminder, we do not recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on equity method investments. And lastly, we expect our Q3 effective tax rate to be approximately 18%. Now some additional thoughts on the rest of the fiscal year and beyond. First, FX. With the strengthening of the US dollar since October, we now expect FX to decrease Q4 revenue and COGS growth by more than one point and operating expense growth by roughly one point. Next, capital expenditures. We expect quarterly spend in Q3 and Q4 to remain at similar levels as our Q2 spend. In FY26, we expect to continue investing against strong demand signals including customer contracted backlog we need to deliver against across the entirety of our Microsoft Cloud. However, the growth rate will be lower than FY25 and the mix of spend will begin to shift back to short-lived assets which are more correlated to revenue growth. As a reminder, our long-lived infrastructure investments are fungible, enabling us to remain agile as we meet customer demand globally across our Microsoft Cloud including AI workloads. As always, there can be quarterly spend variability from cloud infrastructure build-outs and the timing of delivery of finance leases. For the full fiscal year, we continue to expect double-digit revenue and operating income growth as we focus on delivering efficiencies across both COGS and operating expense. And given the operating leverage that we've delivered throughout the year, inclusive of efficiency gains as we scale our AI infrastructure and utilize our own AI solutions, we now expect FY25 operating margins to be up slightly year-over-year. And finally, our FY25 full year effective tax rate should be between 18% and 19%. In closing, we are committed to delivering real world AI solutions that help customers grow and improve their results. We are confident in our leadership position as we grow with our customers.

And echoing Amy's comments, Brett, congratulations on the new role. It's been a pleasure working with you and best of luck in that new role. Looking at the quarter, another really solid quarter when it comes to commercial bookings. But again, we were a little disappointed on Azure coming in at the bottom end of the guidance range. Amy, I was hoping you could dig into perhaps what some of those execution issues were, what the resolution to those issues were. And do we still feel comfortable in the acceleration into the back half of the year that you were talking about after the June quarter and after last quarter?

Let me spend a little time on that about what we saw in Q2 and give you some additional background on the near-term execution issues that we're talking about. First, let me be very specific. They are in the non-AI ACR component. Our Azure AI results were better than we thought due to very good work by the operating teams pulling in some delivery dates even by weeks. When your capacity constrained weeks matter, and it was good execution by the team, and you see that in the revenue results. On the non-AI side, really, the challenges were in what we call the scale motion. So think about primarily these are customers we reach through partners and through more indirect methods of selling. And really, the art form there is as these customers, which we reach in this way, are trying to balance how do you do an AI workload with continuing some of the work they've done on migrations and other fundamentals, we then took our sales motions in the summer and really change to try to balance those two. As you do that, you learn with your customers and with your partners on sort of getting that balance right between where to put our investments, where to put the marketing dollars and importantly, where to put people in terms of coverage and being able to help customers make those transitions. And I think we are going to make some adjustments to make sure we are in balance because when you make those changes in the summer, by the time it works its way through the system, you can see the impacts on whether you have that balance right. And so the teams are working through that. They're already making adjustments. And I expect, while, we will see some impact through H2 just because when you work through the scale motion, it can take some time for that to adjust. I feel good that the teams understand and are working through that. So hopefully that's just helpful on that. Then we talked a little bit about Q3. And so we've talked about 31% to 32% after publishing a 31% this quarter. Our AI results that we had felt good about and talked about our ability to land that revenue is the same. So again, in Q3, we are working from a pretty constrained capacity place. And that's no different than it was our expectation to be in that position last October when I talked to you all. And when I talk about being at a capacity constraint, it takes two things. You have to have space, which I generally call long-lived assets, right, that's the infrastructure and the land and then you have to have kits. We're continuing and you've seen that's why our spend has pivoted this way to be in the long-lived investment. We have been short, power and space. And so as you see those investments land that we've made over the past three years, we get closer to that balance by the end of this year. And so the confidence on the AI side continues to be there in terms of being able to sell, utilize and be, I think, encouraged by the signals. What we're seeing is waiting to see just how the non-AI ACR works through the scale motions in H2. But in general, the only thing that's changed is really that scale motion from my seat, Keith. Hope that's helpful. Satya?",598.0,233.0,8.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.034334763948497854,0.004291845493562232,0.0,0.008583690987124463,0.012875536480686695,0.030042918454935622

I think, Amy, just one thing I'd add, Keith, to your question is, as Amy said, the AI growth rate is actually better than what we expected, and we work through some of the supply stuff and more importantly, some of the workloads are scaling well. And when you look underneath any of these AI workloads, the other thing that is good is the ratio even what we would call just regular storage, data services, app services. So underneath a ChatGPT or a Copilot or even the emerging AI workloads in the enterprise. So that's all good. The enterprise workloads, whether it's SAP or whether it's VMware migrations, what have you, that's also in good shape. And it's just the scale place where Amy talked about this nuance, right, how do you really tweak the incentives, go-to-market at a time of platform shifts, you kind of want to make sure you lean into even the new design wins, and you just don't keep doing the stuff that you did in the previous generation. And that's the art form Amy was referencing to make sure you get the right balance. But let me put it this way. You would rather win the new than just protect the past.

Can you give more color on what drove the far larger than expected Microsoft AI revenue. We talked a bit about the Azure AI component of it. But can you give more color on that?

A couple of pieces to that, which you've correctly identified. Number one is the Azure component we just talked about. And the second piece, you're right, Microsoft Copilot was better. And what was important about that it was -- we saw strength both in seats, both new seats and expansion seats, as Satya talked about, and usage, which doesn't directly impact revenue, but of course, indirectly does as people get more and more value on it. And also price per seat was actually quite good. We still have a good signal for value.

So, yes, in my remarks, I talked about how in some sense, what's happening with AI is no different than what was happening with the regular compute cycle. It's always about bending the curve and then putting more points up the curve. So there's Moore's Law that's working in hyperdrive. Then on top of that, there is the AI scaling laws, both the pre-training and the inference time compute that compound and that's all software. You should think of what I said in my remarks, which we have observed for a while, which is 10x on improvements per cycle just because of all the software optimizations on inference. And so that's what you see. And then to that, I think DeepSeek has had some real innovations. And that is some of the things that even OpenAI found in o1. And so we are going to, obviously, now that all gets commoditized, and it's going to get broadly used. And the big beneficiaries of any software cycle like that is the customers, right. Because at the end of the day, if you think about it, right, what was the big lesson learned from client server to cloud, more people bought servers except it was called cloud. And so when token prices fall, infants computing prices fall, that means people can consume more, and there'll be more apps written. And it's interesting to see that when I referenced these models that are pretty powerful, it's unimaginable to think that here we are in sort of beginning of '25 where on the PC, you can run a model that required pretty massive cloud infrastructure. So that type of optimizations means AI will be much more ubiquitous. And so therefore, for a hyperscaler like us, a PC platform provider like us, this is all good news as far as I'm concerned.",322.0,122.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.02459016393442623,0.00819672131147541,0.0,0.01639344262295082,0.00819672131147541,0.01639344262295082

But Satya, I wanted to ask you about the Stargate news and the announced changes in the OpenAI relationship last week. It seems that most of your investors have interpreted this as Microsoft, for sure, remaining very committed to OpenAI's success. But electing to take more of a backseat in terms of funding OpenAI's future training CapEx needs. I was hoping you might frame your strategic decision here around Stargate, and Amy, whether there's any takeaway for investors from that decision in terms of how you're thinking about CapEx needs over the next several years.

And as you saw, they have committed in a big way to Azure and even in the bookings what we recognize is just the first tranche of it. And so you'll see given the ROFR we have more benefits of that even into the future. And obviously, their success is our success because even all the other commercial arrangements that we detailed out in the blog that we put out even commensurate with that announcement. But to your overall point, the thing that I would say is we are building a pretty fungible fleet, right. We're making sure that there's the right balance between training and inference. It's geo distributed. We are working super hard on all the software oppositions, right. I mean just not the software optimizations that come because of what DeepSeek has done, but all the work we have done to, for example, reduce the prices of GPT models, over the years in partnership with OpenAI. In fact, we did a lot of the work on the inference optimizations on it and that's been key to driving, right. One of the key things to note in AI is you just don't launch the frontier model, but if it's too expensive to serve, it's no good, right. It won't generate any demand. So you've got to have that optimization, so that inferencing costs are coming down and they can be consumed broadly. And so that's the fleet physics we are managing. And also, remember, you don't want to buy too much of anything at one time because the Moore's Law every year is going to give you 2x, your optimization is going to give you 10x. You want to continuously upgrade the fleet, modernize the fleet, age, the fleet, and at the end of the day, have the right ratio of monetization and demand-driven monetization to what you think of as the training expense. So I feel very good about the investment we are making and it's fungible and it just allows us to scale more long-term business.",371.0,149.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03355704697986577,0.013422818791946308,0.0,0.006711409395973154,0.006711409395973154,0.020134228187919462

We have and I think we talked about it, close to $300 billion of RPO, that is committed customer contracts that need to be delivered on. And the faster we can do that and the more efficiently we can do that, the better off we are not just the OpenAI partnership, which is a piece of that, but with the entire platform that we need to deliver for our customers. And I think the other thing that's sometimes missing is when we say fungible, we mean not just the primary use, which we've always talked about, which is inference, but there is some training, post training, which is a key component. And then they're just running the commercial hub, which at every layer under at every modern AI app that's going to be built, it will be required. It will be required to be distributed, and it will be required to be global. And all of those things are really important because it then means you're the most efficient. And so the investment you see us making CapEx. You're right, the front end has been this sort of infrastructure build that lets us really catch up not just on the AI infrastructure we needed, but think about that as the building itself, data centers, but also some of the catch-up we need to do on the commercial cloud side. And then you'll see the pivot to more CPU and GPU. And that pivot will more directly correlate to revenue and it will be contracted either with the partnership that you asked about with OpenAI or with others. And so I do think the way I want everyone to internalize it is that the CapEx growth is going through that cycle pivot, which is far more correlated to customer contract delivery, no matter who the end customer is.",350.0,133.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,0.022556390977443608,0.0,0.015037593984962405,0.022556390977443608,0.03007518796992481,0.022556390977443608

Satya, as we think about Microsoft's very rich Copilot portfolio, now having been in market for over a year, with the products and precision only getting better and the cost of inference coming down, how do you think about the journey from here and perhaps the ability to package and evolve the go-to-market to address the broadest range of customers and customer requirements out there?

One is on the M365 Copilot side, we now have the Copilot Chat. So this is now going to be broadly deployed across the entire install base effectively because you can go have this now turned on by IT and everybody can start using web-grounded chat with all the enterprise controls right away it has Copilot Studio built in. And so that means they can start building agents. So we think of that plus the full Copilot as a good combination that I think will accelerate quite frankly in terms of just seat usage and agent building and what have you. So that's sort of one. And the other thing is you also see even on the consumer side, we just yesterday launched o1, the Think Harder feature on Copilot now that's powered by o1, it's available globally, right. So you can see the benefits of inference optimization and the cost coming down means you can drive more ubiquity of what were features that ones were sort of premium tier and that's all definitely something that we will do across, right.

When you look underneath even a Copilot or a GitHub Copilot or what have you, you already see lots of many different models that you build models, you fine tune models, you distill models. Some of them are models that you distill into an open source model. So there's going to be a combination. So we've always maintained that it's always good to have frontier models. You want to always build your application with high ambition using the best model that is available and then optimize from there on. So that's also another side like there's a temporality to it, right. What you start with as a given COGS profile doesn't need to be the end because you continuously optimize for latency and COGS and putting in different mode. And in fact, all that complexity, by the way, has to be managed by a new app server. So one of the things that we are investing heavily on is foundry because from an app developer perspective, you kind of want to keep pace with the flurry of models that are coming in and you want to have an evergreen way for your application to benefit from all that innovation. But not have all the Dev cost or the DevOps cost or what people talk about AIOps costs. So we are also investing significantly in all the app server for any workload to be able to benefit from all these different models, open source, close source, different weight classes. And at the same time, from an operations perspective, it's faster, easier for you.",295.0,125.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.048,0.008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04

Would love to get some color as to where you're seeing that strength? Is it departmental deals, customers moving from proof-of-concept to departmental deals, maybe multiple departmental deals in the enterprise. You mentioned some uptick in usage trends. Would love to get some color on just the common use cases that you're seeing that give you that confidence that, that will ramp into monetization later.

I mean, I think the initial sort of set of seats were for places where there's more belief in immediate productivity, a sales team, in finance or in supply chain, where there is a lot of like, for example, SharePoint rounded data that you want to be able to use in conjunction with web data and have it produce results that are beneficial. But then what's happening, very much like what we have seen in the previous generation productivity things is that people collaborate across functions, across roads, right. For example, even in my own daily habit is, I go to chat, I use work tab, I get results, and then I immediately share using pages with colleagues. I sort of call it think with AI and work with people. And that pattern then requires you to make it more of a standard issue across the enterprise. And so that's what we are seeing. It starts maybe at a department level. Quickly, the collaboration network effects will effectively demand that you spread it across. You can do it by cohort and what have you. And so what we've made it easier even is to start with Copilot Chat plus this. And so that gives the enterprise customers even more flexibility to have something that's more ubiquitous.",222.0,102.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0392156862745098,0.0,0.00980392156862745,0.00980392156862745,0.00980392156862745,0.0392156862745098

Commercial RPO, I think, increased 39 billion sequentially. That's the most we've ever seen on a sequential basis, commercial bookings growth, 75% constant currency. That's 2x higher than we've seen in the last decade. I appreciate there's some volatility with this metric, but it does feel like this quarter there was a bit of a sea change relative to momentum on backlog and bookings. Can you just talk about maybe the breadth of where that strength came from? Was it broad-based? Was there a couple of large deals? Any color there would be helpful?

We talked a little bit about what are the main drivers, which was one of the Azure commitments that OpenAI has made. And I do want to say, well, that is obviously a big component, you'll continue to see OpenAI make commitment. So I want to separate the concept that it's one time versus an ongoing relationship that will grow as they grow, which it absolutely will. And to your question on what else is participating in that number. First, we did have very good core motions. Our core motions are things like, to your point, renewals of our existing contracts, add-on to those contracts upsell like, for example, Copilot or GitHub Copilot or other processes. And I think that's important. We also had a good E5 quarter, which when we talk a lot about M365 Copilot, I sometimes forget to also talk about suite momentum. And we saw that as well this quarter, which we felt very good about. And then the final component is large Azure commitments. And those really did look as we expected, which is good. To your point, and that you're seeing a really broad-based growth. Those Azure commitments take two forms. One, it's existing customers who've worked through their commitments and are making larger commitments, which is a good commitment signed for the platform. And then you have new customers making commitments, and we also saw that this quarter. And so to your point, sometimes I think a big number that looks like this can make you think it's just one thing. I think you're right. Some of it was one thing, but a lot of it was good execution consistently across the workloads.",297.0,140.0,6.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,8.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.04285714285714286,0.014285714285714285,0.014285714285714285,0.02857142857142857,0.05714285714285714,0.02857142857142857

It was a record quarter, driven by continued strength of Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $42 billion in revenue, up 22% in constant currency. Cloud and AI are the essential inputs for every business to expand output, reduce costs, and accelerate growth. Now, I will highlight examples, starting with infrastructure. We continue to expand our data center capacity. This quarter alone, we opened DCs in 10 countries across four continents. Model capabilities are doubling in performance every six months, thanks to multiple, compounding scaling laws. We continue to optimize and drive efficiencies across every layer – from DC design, to hardware and silicon, to systems software, to model optimization – all towards lowering costs and increasing performance. You see this in our supply chain, where we have reduced dock-to-lead times for new GPUs by nearly 20%. Across our blended fleet, where we have increased AI performance by nearly 30% ISO power. And, our cost per token, which has more than halved. When it comes to cloud migrations, we saw accelerating demand, with customers in every industry, from Abercrombie & Fitch Co., to Coca-Cola and ServiceNow, expanding their footprints on Azure. And we remain the cloud of choice for customers’ mission critical VMWare, SAP, and Oracle workloads, with more regional availability than any other hyperscaler. We are also excited about the next frontier in cloud systems with quantum. In addition to putting our quantum stack on machines from our partners, we are also making real progress on a path to a utility scale quantum computer with the introduction of Majorana-1. When it comes to data and analytics, we have deeply integrated our AI platform with our data stack. PostgreSQL usage accelerated for the third consecutive quarter, and it is now used by nearly 60% of the Fortune 500 including companies like BMW and BNY Mellon. Cosmos DB revenue growth also accelerated again this quarter and remains the go-to database for globally distributed NoSQL workloads at any scale. It is used by customers in every industry like CarMax, DocuSign, NTT Data, and OpenAI. This quarter, we also saw analytics consumption accelerate. Microsoft Fabric has more than 21,000 paid customers, up 80% year-over-year. Fabric brings together data workloads like data warehousing, data science, real-time intelligence, along with Power BI, into one end-to-end solution. Real-time intelligence is now the fastest growing workload in Fabric, with 40% of customers already using it just five months since becoming generally available. All up, more than 50% of Fabric customers – like Amore Pacific, Louisiana state government, and Petrobras – use three or more workloads. And the amount of data in our multi-cloud data lake OneLake has grown more than 6X over the past year. Now, on to AI platforms and tools. Foundry is the agent and AI app factory. It is now used by developers at over 70,000 enterprises and digital natives – from Atomicwork, to Epic, Fujitsu, and Gainsight, to H&R Block and LG Electronics – to design, customize, and manage their AI apps and agents. We processed over 100 trillion tokens this quarter, up 5X year-over-year – including a record 50 trillion tokens last month alone. And four months in, over 10,000 organizations have used our new Agent Service to build, deploy, and scale their agents. This quarter we also made a new suite of fine-tuning tools available to customers with industry-leading reliability. And we brought the latest models from OpenAI, along with new models from Cohere, DeepSeek, Meta, Mistral, Stability to Foundry. And we have expanded our Phi family of SLMs with new multimodal and mini models. All up, Phi has been downloaded 38 million times. And our research teams are taking it one step further, with BitNet b1.58, a billion parameter large language model that can run on just CPUs, coming to the Foundry. Now, on to developer tools. We are evolving GitHub Copilot from pair to peer programmer. With agent mode in VS Code, Copilot can now iterate on code, recognize errors, and fix them automatically. This adds to other Copilot agents like Autofix, which helps developers remediate vulnerabilities, as well as Code Review Agent, which has already reviewed over 8 million pull requests. And we are previewing a first-of-its-kind SWE agent capable of asynchronously executing developer tasks. All-up, we now have over 15 million GitHub Copilot users, up over 4X year-over-year. And both digital natives like Twilio and enterprises like Cisco, HPE, SkyScanner, and Target, continue to choose GitHub Copilot to equip their developers with AI throughout the entire dev lifecycle. With Visual Studio and VS Code, we have the world’s most popular editor, with over 50 million monthly active users. And with Power Platform we have the leading low code platform for AI makers too. We now have 56 million monthly active Power Platform users, up 27% year-over-year, who increasingly use our AI features to build apps and automate processes. Now, on to the future of work. Microsoft 365 Copilot is built to facilitate human-agent collaboration. Hundreds of thousands of customers across geographies and industries now use Copilot, up 3X year-over-year. Our overall deal size continues to grow, and this quarter, we saw a record number of customers returning to buy more seats. And we are going further. Just last week, we announced a major update, bringing together agents, notebooks, search, and create into a new scaffolding for work. Our new Researcher and Analyst deep reasoning agents analyze vast amounts of web and enterprise data to deliver highly-skilled expertise on demand directly within Copilot. Beyond horizontal knowledge work, we are introducing agents for every role and business process. Our Sales Agent turns contacts into qualified leads, and with Sales Chat reps can quickly get up to speed on new accounts. And our Customer Service Agent is deflecting customer inquiries and helping service reps resolve issues faster. With Copilot Studio, customers can extend Copilot and build their own agents with no-code/low code. More than 230,000 organizations – including 90% of the Fortune 500 – have already used Copilot Studio. With deep reasoning and agent flows in Copilot Studio, customers can build agents that perform more complex tasks, and also handle deterministic scenarios like document processing and financial approvals. And they can now build “computer use” agents that take action on the UI across desktop and web apps. And, with just a click, they can turn any SharePoint site into an agent too. This quarter alone, customers created over 1 million custom agents across SharePoint and Copilot Studio, up 130% quarter-over-quarter. When it comes to business applications, Dynamics 365 again took share as companies like Avaya, Brunswick, SoftCat, switched to Dynamics from legacy providers. Verizon, for example, chose Dynamics 365 Sales to improve the efficiency of its sellers. In healthcare, Dragon Copilot is off to a fast start. Last quarter alone, we helped document nearly 9.5 million physician-patient encounters at providers like City of Hope, Ottawa Hospital, Tufts Medicine and WellStar, up over 50% quarter-over-quarter. In manufacturing, we introduced Factory Operations and Safety Agents at Hannover Messe. And leading partners like Autodesk, PTC, and Siemens have all built their own industrial AI solutions on our stack. And, in retail, we have introduced agents to help customers like Bath & Body Works build more personalized shopping experiences and improve store operations. When it comes to Windows, Copilot+ PCs are faster and have better battery life than other devices in their category. We also continue to win new customers with best-in-class AI capabilities. We offer a growing number of AI apps from partners like Adobe, Canva, and Zoom. Just last week, we rolled out exclusive AI experiences like Recall, Click to Do, and Windows Search, to all Copilot+ PCs. And we continue to see increased commercial traction as we approach end-of-support for Windows 10. Windows 11 commercial deployments increased nearly 75% year-over-year. Now, on to security. Security is our top priority, and we have made significant progress against the engineering objectives we outlined a year and a half ago as part of our Secure Future Initiative. We are now applying these learnings to deliver new innovation across our platform. Last month, along with our partners, we introduced Security Copilot agents to help defenders autonomously handle high-volume security and IT tasks, informed by 84 trillion daily threat signals. We also added new capabilities to Defender, Entra, and Purview to help organizations secure and govern their AI deployments. All up, we now have 1.4 million security customers. Over 900,000 – including EY Global, Manpower Group, TriNet, Regions Bank – have 4 or more workloads, up 21% year-over-year. And, in identity, Entra now has more than 900 million monthly active users. Now, on to our consumer businesses, starting with LinkedIn. Over one billion professionals use LinkedIn to connect, learn, hire, and sell – and our membership continues to grow at double digits year-over-year. Time spent watching videos on the platform was up 36%, and comments were up 32% year-over-year. We are also seeing more members use AI to gain new skills and find jobs. The number of learners who have used AI-powered coaching increased over 2X quarter-over-quarter. And we remain the market leader in hiring, as customers like Equinix and Verizon use LinkedIn Hiring Assistant to find qualified candidates faster. When it comes to LinkedIn Premium, we saw over 75% quarter-over-quarter subscriber growth to our Premium Pages offering for SMBs. And LinkedIn Marketing Solutions continues to be the best way to reach B2B decision makers, with two consecutive quarters of accelerated revenue growth. More broadly, when it comes to advertising, we are transforming how people search, browse, discover content, and use AI as a personal assistant. With Copilot Search in Bing, we are reimagining search results with overview pages curated by AI, and embedded conversational capabilities. With Copilot Vision in Edge, Copilot sees what you see and gives you real-time responses while you browse. With Copilot Discover, we are personalizing the MSN experience, based on user interactions and preferences. And with our updated Copilot app, we are focused on building daily engagement and successful sessions across a range of modalities, whether it is conversing, searching, shopping, or travel planning. All up, we again took share across Bing and Edge. And our total advertising revenue across our businesses has surpassed $20 billion over the last 12 months. Now, on to gaming. We continue to transform the business and focus on margin expansion, as we bring our games to over 500 million monthly active users across devices. We ended the quarter as the top publisher by pre-orders and pre-installs on both Xbox and the PlayStation Store. PC Game Pass revenue increased over 45% year-over-year. With Xbox Play Anywhere, players now can access more than 1,000 games they can play across console and PC. And just last week we brought cloud gaming to LG TVs. Cloud gaming set a new record, surpassing 150 million hours played for the first time this quarter. We are also integrating AI across Xbox. New Copilot for Gaming is a personalized gaming companion that provides in-game assistance and expert coaching. And our first of its kind Muse model can generate gameplay in real-time. Finally, it is fantastic to see the success of Minecraft Movie which is the top grossing film of the year. In addition to monetizing our IP in new ways, we have seen a 75 percent-plus increase in weekly active users of the game year-over-year since the release. In closing, we are rapidly innovating to expand our opportunity across both consumer and commercial businesses. In just a few weeks, at our Build conference, we will share how we’re creating the most powerful AI platform for developers—and I encourage you to tune in. With that, let me turn it over to Amy.",1953.0,1058.0,30.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,0.02835538752362949,0.004725897920604915,0.004725897920604915,0.001890359168241966,0.0,0.023629489603024575

This quarter, revenue was $70.1 billion, up 13% and 15% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased 11% and 13% in constant currency while operating income increased 16% and 19% in constant currency. And earnings per share was $3.46, an increase of 18% and 19% in constant currency. Results exceeded expectations driven by focused execution from our sales and partner teams. We continue to see strong demand for our cloud and AI offerings as they help customers drive productivity, increase efficiencies, and grow their businesses. And, again this quarter, revenue from our AI business was above expectations. Commercial bookings increased 18% and 17% in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations again this quarter, driven by an Azure commitment from OpenAI. We also saw consistent execution across our core annuity sales motions and continued long-term commitments to our platform. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased to $315 billion, up 34% and 33% in constant currency. Roughly 40% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 17% year over year. The remaining portion, recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 47%. And this quarter, our annuity mix was 98%. FX was roughly in line with expectations on total company revenue, segment level revenue, and operating expense growth. FX decreased COGS growth by only 1 point, 1 point unfavorable to expectations. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $42.4 billion, ahead of expectations, and grew 20% and 22% in constant currency. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage was 69%, in line with expectations, and decreased 3 points year over year driven by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure. Company gross margin percentage was also 69%, down 1 point year over year driven by scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 2% and 3% in constant currency, lower than expected due to our focus on cost efficiencies as well as investments that shifted to Q4. Operating margins increased 1 point year over year to 46%, better than expected as we continue to focus on building high-performing teams and increasing our agility by reducing layers with fewer managers. At a total company level, headcount at the end of March was 2% higher than a year ago and was down slightly compared to last quarter. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $29.9 billion and grew 10% and 13% in constant currency, ahead of expectations driven by LinkedIn, Microsoft 365 commercial products, and Microsoft 365 consumer. M365 commercial cloud revenue increased 12% and 15% in constant currency, in line with expectations. ARPU growth was again driven by E5 and M365 Copilot. With M365 Copilot, we continue to see growth across customer segments and geos. Paid M365 commercial seats grew 7% year over year to over 430 million. While we continue to see installed base expansion across all customer segments, growth was primarily driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings. M365 commercial products revenue increased 5% and 8% in constant currency, ahead of expectations due to higher-than-expected Office transactional purchasing. M365 consumer cloud revenue increased 10% and 12% in constant currency, ahead of expectations driven by higher-than-expected subscription growth following the January price increase. M365 consumer subscriptions grew 9% to 87.7 million. LinkedIn revenue increased 7% and 8% in constant currency. Results were ahead of expectations due to better-than-expected performance across all businesses. The Talent Solutions business continues to be impacted by weakness in the hiring market. Dynamics 365 revenue increased 16% and 18% in constant currency, in line with expectations with continued growth across all workloads. Segment gross margin dollars increased 10% and 13% in constant currency and gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged year over year even with the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 1% and 2% in constant currency and operating income increased 15% and 18% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $26.8 billion and grew 21% and 22% in constant currency, ahead of expectations driven by Azure. In Azure and other cloud services, revenue grew 33% and 35% in constant currency including 16 points from AI services. Focused execution drove non-AI services results where we saw accelerated growth in our enterprise customer segment as well as some improvement in our scale motions. And, in Azure AI services, we brought capacity online faster than expected. In our on-premises server business, revenue decreased 6% and 4% in constant currency, slightly below expectations driven by renewals with lower in-period revenue recognition from the mix of contracts. The year over year decline is reflective of the continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Enterprise and partner services revenue increased 5% and 6% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations due to better-than-expected performance in Enterprise Support Services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 13% and 14% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased 4 points year over year driven by scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 6% and 7% in constant currency and operating income grew 17% and 18% in constant currency. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $13.4 billion and grew 6% and 7% in constant currency, ahead of expectations due to better-than-expected results across all businesses. Windows OEM and Devices revenue increased 3% year over year, ahead of expectations as tariff uncertainty through the quarter resulted in inventory levels that remained elevated. Search and news advertising revenue ex-TAC increased 21% and 23% in constant currency. Results were significantly ahead of expectations driven by usage from a third-party partnership, better-than-expected rate expansion, and volume growth across Edge and Bing. And in Gaming, revenue increased 5% and 6% in constant currency. Xbox content and services revenue increased 8% and 9% in constant currency, ahead of expectations driven by stronger-than-expected performance in third-party and first-party content. Segment gross margin dollars increased 9% and 11% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage increased 2 points year over year driven by strong execution on margin improvement in Search and Gaming. Operating expenses increased 1%. Operating income increased 21% and 23% in constant currency driven by continued prioritization of higher margin opportunities. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures including finance leases were $21.4 billion, slightly lower than expected due to normal variability from the timing of delivery of data center leases. Cash paid for PP&E was $16.7 billion. Roughly half of our cloud and AI related spend was on long-lived assets that will support monetization over the next 15 years and beyond. The remaining cloud and AI spend was primarily for servers, both CPUs and GPUs, to serve customers based on demand signals including our customer contracted backlog of $315 billion. Cash flow from operations was $37 billion, up 16% driven by strong cloud billings and collections, partially offset by higher tax payments. And this quarter, free cash flow was $20.3 billion. Other income and expense was negative $623 million, more favorable than anticipated primarily due to net gains on derivatives and investments. Our losses on investments accounted for under the equity method were slightly higher than expected. Our effective tax rate was approximately 18%. And finally, we returned $9.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, an increase of 15% year over year. Now, moving to our Q4 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a US dollar basis. First, thru April, demand signals across our commercial businesses as well as in LinkedIn, Gaming, and Search have remained consistent. Our outlook assumes those trends continue in Q4. If the environment changes, our results may be impacted. In our Windows OEM business, our outlook assumes the elevated inventory levels from Q3 will come down in Q4. We have widened our guidance range in our More Personal Computing segment to account for some of this variability. Next, FX. With the weakening of the US dollar in April, we now expect FX to increase total revenue growth by one point. Within the segments, we expect FX to increase revenue growth by one point in Productivity and Business Processes and less than one point in Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing. We expect FX to increase COGS and operating expense growth by less than one point. In commercial bookings, we expect solid growth on a significant prior year comparable and a growing expiry base. Bookings growth will be driven by strong execution across our core annuity sales motions and continued long-term commitments to our platform. As a reminder, larger longer-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, can drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be roughly 67%, down year over year primarily driven by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure. And now, capital expenditures. We expect Q4 capital expenditures to increase on a sequential basis. H2 capex in total remains unchanged from our January H2 guidance. As a reminder, there can be quarterly spend variability from cloud infrastructure buildouts and the timing of delivery of finance leases. Next to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes we expect revenue of $32.05 to $32.35 billion, or growth of 11% to 12% in constant currency. M365 commercial cloud revenue growth should be approximately 14% in constant currency, relatively stable compared to the prior quarter. We expect continued ARPU growth thru E5 and M365 Copilot and some seat growth moderation given the size of the installed base. M365 commercial products revenue growth should be in the mid-single digits. As a reminder, M365 commercial products includes both the Windows Commercial on-premises components of M365 suites and Office transactional purchasing, both of which can be variable due to in period revenue recognition dynamics. M365 consumer cloud revenue growth should be in the mid-teens driven by the January price increase. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the high single digits. And in Dynamics 365, we expect revenue growth to be in the mid to high teens with continued growth across all workloads. For Intelligent Cloud we expect revenue of $28.75 to $29.05 billion or growth of 20% to 22% in constant currency. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q4 revenue growth to be between 34% and 35% in constant currency driven by strong demand for our portfolio of services. In our non-AI services, we expect focused execution to continue driving healthy growth. In our AI services, while we continue to bring datacenter capacity online as planned, demand is growing a bit faster. Therefore, we now expect to have some AI capacity constraints beyond June. In our on-premises server business, we again expect revenue to decline in the mid-single digits with the ongoing customer shift to cloud offerings. And in Enterprise and partner services, we expect revenue growth to be in the mid to high single digits driven by Enterprise Support Services. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to be $12.35 to $12.85 billion. Windows OEM and Devices revenue should decline in the mid to high single digits. We expect Windows OEM revenue to decline in the low to mid-single digits assuming OEM inventory levels come down thru the quarter as noted earlier, although the range of potential outcomes is wider than normal. Devices revenue should decline in the high teens. Search and news advertising ex-TAC revenue growth should be in the high teens, even on a strong prior year comparable. We expect to see continued growth in both volume and revenue per search with share gains across Edge and Bing. Overall Search and news advertising revenue growth should be in the mid-teens. And in Gaming, we expect revenue growth to be in the mid-single digits. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth to be in the high single digits driven by first-party content. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS of $23.6 to $23.8 billion or growth of 19% to 20% in constant currency and operating expense of $18 to $18.1 billion or growth of approximately 5% in constant currency. Therefore, even with ongoing AI investments as we scale, we continue to expect full-year FY25 operating margins to be up slightly year over year. Other income and expense is expected to be roughly negative $1.2 billion primarily driven by investments accounted for under the equity method. As a reminder, we do not recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on equity method investments. And lastly, we expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. Now I’d like to share some closing thoughts as we look to the next fiscal year. We remain committed to investing against the strong demand signals we see for our services. So, as a reminder, our earlier comments on FY26 capital expenditures remain unchanged. We expect capex to grow, it will grow at a lower rate than FY25 and will include a greater mix of short-lived assets which are more directly correlated to revenue than long-lived assets. These investments, along with focused execution that delivers near-term value to our customers, will ensure we continue to lead through the cloud and AI opportunity ahead.

Thank you guys for taking the question, and congratulations on a fantastic quarter in what all of us are looking at as a difficult environment, a lot of uncertainty out there, so really impressive to put up the results that you guys did. One of the things that we heard a lot about this quarter in the media and press reports was changing data center commitments, maybe Microsoft walking away from some of those data center commitments. But it sounds like the AI demand is very strong. You’re talking about not being able to hit all that demand with supply. Can you talk to us about what’s going on with your datacenter strategy? Are there any shifts taking place? And maybe in particular, Satya, you could talk about some of the comments that you had made about the potential risk for oversupplies and GPUs out in the future. What exactly was that risk you were talking about? And are you incorporating that risk into your datacenter strategy?",176.0,74.0,5.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.06756756756756757,0.04054054054054054,0.0945945945945946,0.0,0.02702702702702703,0.02702702702702703

The reality is, we’ve always been making adjustments to build, lease, what pace we build, all through the last 10-15 years. It’s just that you all pay a lot more attention to what we do quarter over quarter nowadays. Having said that, the key thing for us is to have our builds and lease be positioned for what is the workload growth of the future. That’s what you have to go and seek to. There’s a demand part to it. There is the shape of the workload part to it, and there is a location part to it. You don’t want to be upside-down on having one big data center in one region, when you have a global demand footprint. You don’t want to be upside-down when the shape of demand changes, because, after all, with essentially pre-training plus test time compute, that’s a big change in terms of how you think about even what is training. Forget inferencing. Fundamentally, given all of that, and then every time there’s great Moore’s Law, but remember, this is a compounding S-curve, which is, there’s Moore’s Law, there’s system software, there’s model architecture changes, there’s the app server efficiency. Given all of that, we just want to make sure we’re building, accounting for the latest and greatest information we have on all of that. And that’s what you see reflected, and I feel very, very good about the pace. In fact, Amy just mentioned, we will be short power. And so, therefore, but it’s not power. It’s not a blanket statement. I need power in specific places so that we can either lease or build at the pace at which we want. And so, that’s the plan that we’re executing. Maybe, Amy, you can add to that.",326.0,125.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.024,0.008,0.008,0.016,0.0,0.016

From land to build to buildouts can be lead times of five to seven years, two to three years. We’re constantly in a balancing position as we watch demand curves and many of things Satya watched. And the second part is just to maybe remind you, when Satya talks about being short power, he’s really talking about data center space. And so, we’ve continued through the second half to put things in place. In fact, we talked a little bit about pulling even some of that space to be ready earlier and being able to deliver that earlier to customers this quarter, which is really good work by the teams, as we continue to get more and more efficient at that process. And I look forward to being able to continue to do that in the future. I did talk about in my comments, we had hoped to be in balance by the end of Q4. We did see some increased demand, as you saw through the quarter. We are going to be a little short, still, a little tight as we exit the year, but are encouraged by that.",215.0,96.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.052083333333333336,0.0,0.020833333333333332,0.0,0.0,0.052083333333333336

Yeah, I sort of think about three big things that are happening in the cloud, all at parallel, and there is also a relationship between them. One is, I’ll just say, the classic migration of whether it’s SQL, Windows Server. And so, that’s, again, got good steady state progress, because the reality is, I think everyone’s now, perhaps there’s another kick in the datacenter migrations, just because of the efficiency the cloud provides. That’s one part. The second piece is good data growth. You saw Postgres on Azure. I mean, forgetting SQL Server, Postgres on Azure is growing. Cosmos is growing, the analytic stuff I talked about with Fabric. It’s even the others, whether it is Databricks or even Snowflake on Azure are growing. We feel very good about Fabric growth and our data growth. Then the cloud-native growth, this is, again, before we even get to AI, some of the core compute consumption of cloud-native players is also very healthy. It was healthy throughout the quarter. We projected to go moving forward as well. Then the thing to notice is the ratio, and I think we’ve mentioned this multiple times before. If you look underneath even ChatGPT, in fact, that team does a fantastic job of thinking about not only their growth in terms of AI accelerators they need. They use Cosmos DB. They use Postgres. They use core compute and storage. And so, there’s even a ratio between any AI workload in terms of AI accelerator to others. Those are the four pockets, I would say, or four different trend lines, which all have a relationship with each other. And if I step back, and Amy and I talk a lot about this, this time around, there’s nothing certain for sure in the future, except for one thing, which is our largest business is our infrastructure business. And the good news here is the next big platform shift builds on that. It’s not a complete rebuild, having gone through some of these platform shift, where you have to come out on the other side with a full rebuild. If there is good news here, it’s that we have a good business in Azure that continues to grow, and the new platform depends on that. We want to stay disciplined and execute super well on that.",403.0,179.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.05027932960893855,0.0,0.0111731843575419,0.0,0.00558659217877095,0.05027932960893855

The way, at least, I think we will approach it is, quite frankly, be very focused on how we help our customers if there is any turbulence in the macro, because one of the things that we feel we can do, just because of the efficiencies of the cloud, and the footprint we have and the differentiated layers of the stack, from the SaaS application side to the infrastructure side, I think if you buy into the argument that software is the most malleable resource we have to fight any type of inflationary pressure or any type of growth pressure where you need to do more with less, I think we can be super helpful in that.

Of course, you mentioned that you got a bit of a kicker from capacity coming online. But I’m a little bit more interested in where the demand came in above expectations, like what workload type.

Just to provide some clarity, because I think your question implies something that we didn’t mean to imply on the call. First, the real outperformance in Azure this quarter was in our non-AI business. Then to talk about the AI business, really what was better was precisely what we said. We talked about this. We knew Q3 that we had really matched supply and demand pretty carefully, and so didn’t expect to do much better than we had guided to on the AI side. We’ve been quite consistent on that. The only real up side we saw on the AI side of the business was that we were able to deliver supply early to a number of customers.

And so, the way, of course, you’ve seen that historically is right when we went through the prior cloud transitions, you see CapEx accelerate. You build out datacenter footprints. You slowly fill CPU capacity. And over time, you see software efficiencies and hardware efficiencies build on themselves. And you saw that process for us, for, goodness, now, quite a long time. And what Satya’s talking about is how quickly that’s happening on the AI side of the business, and you add to that model diversity. Think about the same levers, plus model efficiency, those compound. Now, the one thing that’s a little different this time is just the pace. And so, when you’re seeing that happen, pace in terms of efficiency time, but also pace in terms of the buildout, so it can mask some of the progress. But we are working hard across all of the teams, hardware, software, even the build teams, to get things in place as quickly as possible, dock to live times. All of that is improving, and all of that actually is benefiting us.

First of all, I think some of the work that actually, OpenAI first pioneered and did with all of the reasoning models, and of course, DeepSeek has added to it and done good work as well, and others as well, the idea that you can have test time compute plus pre-training, and then some of the great optimization at inference time that has all happened has proven out. I mean, if you look at it, I would say for every Moore’s Law change and movement, there’s probably a 10x improvement because of software. That’s what’s happening with these models. Some of it comes from model architecture. Some of that comes from data efficiency, compute efficiency, and what have you. That’s what we are riding, and we feel that, all up, when you have a commodity that is getting that better, then the question is, how do you build out a fleet that’s super balanced, so that then the workloads can be built and can, in fact, take advantage of that efficiency at the underlying infrastructure? I mean, it’s kind of like virtualization. What is the difference between servers and, again, client server with virtualization? It was efficiency. What is the difference between virtualization and cloud? It was efficiency. What is the difference between this generation of cloud and AI? It’s efficiency.

Congratulations on those Azure numbers, which I think are, quite honestly, just inspiring. Maybe, Amy, to the point that you’re making that the surprise factor was on the non-AI side of the house, and it sounds like there’s confidence in that continuing beyond. How much of that are you starting to see the pull in of the non-AI driven by the AI portion of Azure? And on the AI portion, specifically, as test time compute really just blows out kind of prior conceptions of scaling law challenges, how much does that change, potentially, the curve of the AI Azure growth as you go forward here over the next few quarters?",131.0,58.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.017241379310344827,0.017241379310344827,0.017241379310344827,0.0,-0.017241379310344827

It’s always a good chance to get to iterate this. It’s getting harder and harder to separate what an AI workload is from a non-AI workload. And we’ve talked about it this way, I think, in most instances, to make sure people understood that when we were accelerating all of our CapEx spend over the past two and a half or three years now, that people had confidence that we were turning that into revenue and product in a way that was transparent and that everyone could understand, really the goals that we had set for ourselves and for our partners and customers in terms of building product that turned to revenue. But if you take a step back from that, it’s that these workloads are being built, GPUs, CPUs, storage, network, all the same things. And so, I think really what we’re talking about is really how Satya talked about, in one of the earlier questions, we’re seeing digital natives. Digital natives build workloads. They do AI work. They do non-AI work. Do they tend to do that work in the same cloud? Lots of times. Sometimes it’s all in the same place, not all the time. But that relationship gets stronger and stronger as people pivot to more of AI heavy workloads. And so, I think you’re starting to see some of that relationship. I think we’ll continue to see that as AI workloads continue to get built and experimented with, and proof of concepts get expanded. And so, I think I mostly focus on the fact that together, we saw good performance in Q3 on Azure, Azure inclusive of both components, in terms of our execution, in terms of the field and partner teams, and backlog and conversion, and interesting workloads, and adding customer value, and solving real problems, and adding real value. And I think that’s probably, Alex, how I would approach that number, more than trying to separate it in the way that even we have talked about it, but for very different reasons.",369.0,158.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.03164556962025317,0.012658227848101266,0.0189873417721519,0.0,0.0,0.0189873417721519

MSFT,2025-07-30,2025-07-31,,2025-07-30,2025-07-30T17:30:00-04:00,0,2025-07-30,prepared,,Satya Nadella,"Thank you, Jonathan. It was a very strong close to what was a record fiscal year for us. All up, Microsoft Cloud surpassed $168 billion in annual revenue, up 23%. The rate of innovation and the speed of diffusion is unlike anything we have seen. To that end, we are building the most comprehensive suite of AI products and tech stack at massive scale. And to provide more context, I want to walk up the stack, starting with Azure. Azure surpassed $75 billion in annual revenue, up 34%, driven by growth across all workloads. We continue to lead the AI infrastructure wave and took share every quarter this year. We opened new DCs across 6 continents and now have over 400 data centers across 70 regions, more than any other cloud provider. There is a lot of talk in the industry about building the first gigawatt and multi-gigawatt data centers. We stood up more than 2 gigawatts of new capacity over the past 12 months alone. And we continue to scale our own data center capacity faster than any other competitor. Every Azure region is now AI-first. All of our regions can now support liquid cooling, increasing the fungibility and the flexibility of our fleet. And we are driving and riding a set of compounding S curves across silicon, systems and models to continuously improve efficiency and performance for our customers. Take, for example, GPT4o family of models, which have the highest volume of inference tokens. Through software optimizations alone, we are delivering 90% more tokens for the same GPU compared to a year ago. Beyond the AI fleet, we continue to build our commercial cloud to address customers' unique data residency and sovereignty requirements. This quarter, we introduced the Microsoft Sovereign Cloud, the industry's most comprehensive solution spanning both public and private cloud deployments. All of this innovation is driving our strong results. We saw accelerating growth from migrations again this quarter. Nestle, for example, migrated more than 200 SAP instances, 10,000-plus servers, 1.2 petabytes of data to Azure with near 0 business disruption. That makes it one of the largest and most successful migrations in business history. The next big accelerator in the cloud will be Quantum, and I'm excited about our progress. In fact, earlier this month, we announced the world's first operational deployment of a Level 2 Quantum computer in partnership with Atom Computing. This is how we will continue to think and make investments, with decade-long arcs, while making progress every quarter. The next layer is data, which is foundational to every AI application. Microsoft Fabric is becoming the complete data and analytics platform for the AI era, spanning everything from SQL to no-SQL, to analytics workloads. It continues to gain momentum with revenue up 55% year-over-year and over 25,000 customers. It's the fastest-growing database product in our history. Fabric OneLake spans all databases and clouds, including semantic models from Power BI, and therefore, it is the best source of knowledge and grounding for AI applications and context engineering. Azure Databricks and Snowflake on Azure both accelerated as well. Cosmos DB and Azure PostgreSQL are both powering mission- critical workloads at scale. OpenAI, for example, uses Cosmos DB in the hot path of every ChatGPT interaction, storing chat history, user profiles and conversational state. And Azure PostgreSQL stores metadata critical to the operation of ChatGPT as well as OpenAI's developer APIs. This year, we launched Azure AI Foundry to help customers design, customize and manage AI applications and agents at scale. Foundry features best-in-class tooling, management, observability and built-in controls for trustworthy AI. Customers increasingly want to use multiple AI models to meet their specific performance, cost and use case requirements. And with Foundry, they can provision inferencing throughput once and apply it across more models than any other hyperscaler, including models from OpenAI, DeepSeek, Meta, xAI's Grok and, very soon, Black Forest Labs and Mistral AI. We sim-shipped 15 models from OpenAI alone on Foundry this year, providing same-day access to state-of-the-art models deeply integrated with our infrastructure and tools. And we are seeing accelerated adoption of our new Foundry Agent Service, which is now being used by 14,000 customers to build agents that automate complex tasks. For example, Nasdaq is using foundry to build agents that help customers prepare for Board meetings, cutting prep time by up to 25%. All up, 80% of Fortune 500 already use Foundry. And when we look narrowly at just the number of tokens served by Foundry APIs, we processed over 500 trillion this year, up over 7x. This is a good indicator of true platform diffusion beyond a few head apps and services. Talking about the app layer, these applications are becoming embedded in our daily work and life. Our family of Copilot apps has surpassed 100 million monthly active users across commercial and consumer. And when you take a broader look at the engagement of AI features across our products, we have over 800 million monthly active users. Microsoft 365 Copilot is becoming the new way to organize work and workflow and work artifacts. We rolled out our biggest update to Microsoft 365 Copilot to date this quarter, bringing together chat, search, create, notebooks as well as agents into one intuitive scaffolding. With this innovation and continued product improvements, we are seeing real momentum. Customers continue to adopt Copilot at a faster rate than any other new Microsoft 365 suite, with strong usage intensity as shown by our week-over-week retention. And we saw the largest quarter of seat adds since launch with a record number of customers returning to buy more seats. Barclays, for example, will roll out Microsoft 365 Copilot to 100,000 employees globally following a successful initial deployment of 15,000. UBS is expanding its deployment to all of its employees after initially rolling it out to 55,000 of them. And Adobe, KPMG, Pfizer, Wells Fargo all purchased over 25,000 seats this quarter. Tens of thousands of organizations have already used our Researcher and Analyst deep reasoning agents in the first weeks of availability. And we have introduced group-level agents in Teams like Facilitator and Interpreter, which generate real-time translation and notes in meetings. Hundreds of partners like Adobe, SAP, ServiceNow and Workday have built their own third-party agents that integrate with Copilot and Teams. We are also seeing more customers use Copilot Studio to extend Microsoft 365 Copilot and build their own agents. This year, customers created 3 million agents using SharePoint and Copilot Studio. And with Copilot Tuning, they can easily create agents fine- tuned on their company's data, workflow and style that reflect their unique tone, language and expertise. We're also seeing great traction among specific roles and functions, starting with developers. GitHub Copilot continues to have great momentum in IDE with Agent Mode and new form factors like Coding Agent which is capable of asynchronously executing developer tasks. We have 20 million GitHub Copilot users. GitHub Copilot enterprise customers increased 75% quarter-over-quarter as companies tailor Copilot to their own codebases, and 90% of the Fortune 100 now use GitHub Copilot. More broadly, GitHub usage and repos are seeing explosive growth because of AI. AI projects on GitHub more than doubled over the last year. The surge in vibe coding projects and AI coding agents, whether it is Claude Code, Codex, Cursor or GitHub Copilot, are generating more pull requests and more repos on GitHub. And our Code Review Agent is being used heavily across the platform, performing millions of code reviews each month. In health care, we had a breakout year for Dragon Copilot. Customers used our ambient AI solutions to document over 13 million physician-patient encounters this quarter, up nearly 7x year-over-year. For example, at Mercyhealth system, more than 1,000 physicians are already using Copilot to reduce administrative burden, so that they can focus on providing better care. They have saved more than 100,000 hours to date and plan to expand to all 5,000 providers. As one physician put it, ""The best thing to happen to my practice in 10 years."" And in security, we were the first in the industry to introduce agents to help defenders autonomously handle high-volume security and IT tasks. More broadly, AI is driving a fundamental change in the biz apps market as customers shift from legacy systems to agentic business applications. Dynamics 365 took share this year. And we are winning customers in every industry, like Verizon with Sales, Domino's Pizza Group with ERP, 1-800-Flowers with Contact Center. When it comes to consumer apps, we are innovating across all surfaces. In fact, on Monday, we introduced Copilot Mode in Edge. It's especially exciting to see the innovation coming back to browsers. Copilot Mode brings together Copilot composer, chat, discover, search and actions to build the next generation of browser for the AI age. Our Copilot consumer app also continued to see strong growth in engagement and successful sessions. And we are bringing Copilot to every Windows 11 PC. With Copilot Vision, you can share your screen with Copilot and get real-time insights and assistance on anything. And we are well positioned as we approach Windows 10 end of support in October, thanks to Windows 11 and Copilot+ PCs, which offer customers compelling security as well as AI value. Talking about security, it underlies our cloud and AI infrastructure as well as our Copilots and agents. We have launched over 100 new capabilities over the past year. Just last week, we added a modern data lake to our SIEM Microsoft Sentinel, bringing together customer data across our first-party tools as well as third-party ecosystem over 350 connectors. We are also extending the systems customers already use for governance, identity, security and management to protect every AI agent. Entra now extends identity permissions, policies and access controls to agents. Defender secures nearly 2 million general AI apps. Purview is used by 3/4 of the Microsoft 365 Copilot customers to protect their data. And all up, we now have nearly 1.5 million security customers and continue to take share across all major categories we serve. Before I wrap, I want to talk about 2 consumer businesses of ours with massive end-user reach: LinkedIn and Xbox. LinkedIn is home to 1.2 billion members with 4 consecutive years of double-digit member growth. All up, comments on LinkedIn rose over 30% and video uploads increased over 20% this year. We continue to bring AI to every part of LinkedIn experience, introducing agents across hiring as well as sales. When it comes to Gaming, we have 500 million monthly active users across platforms and devices. We are now the top publisher on both Xbox and PlayStation this quarter with successful launches of Forza Horizon 5 and Oblivion Remastered. The Call of Duty franchise has never been stronger. 50 million people have played Black Ops 6; total hours surpassed $2 billion. Minecraft saw record monthly active usage in revenue this quarter, thanks in large part to the success of the Minecraft Movie. And we have nearly 40 games in development, so much, much more to come. We surpassed over 500 million hours of gameplay stream via the cloud this year. And Game Pass annual revenue was nearly $5 billion for the first time. In closing, we are going through a generational tech shift with AI, and I have never been more confident in Microsoft's opportunity to drive long-term growth and define what the future looks like. With that, let me turn it over to Amy to walk through our financial results as well as the outlook.",1902.0,1025.0,38.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,4.0,9.0,5.0,2.0,0.037073170731707315,0.001951219512195122,0.004878048780487805,0.0,0.003902439024390244,0.0351219512195122

This year, we delivered over $281 billion in revenue, up 15% year-over-year, which reflects the broad strength of our products and services. Operating income was over $128 billion, up 17% year-over-year as we invested against the expansive opportunity ahead. And in our largest quarter of the year, we significantly exceeded expectations with strong execution by our sales and partner teams. As Satya shared, we're innovating faster than ever to deliver new value to our customers. This quarter, revenue was $76.4 billion, up 18%, and 17% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased 16%, and 15% in constant currency, while operating income increased 23%, and 22% in constant currency. And earnings per share was $3.65, an increase of 24%, and 22% in constant currency. For the first time, commercial bookings were over $100 billion, increasing 37%, and 30% in constant currency, on a strong prior year comparable. Strong execution across our core annuity sales motions, including healthy renewals, as well as an increase in the number of $10 million and $100 million-plus contracts for both Azure and Microsoft 365 helped drive these results. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased to $368 billion, up 37% and 35% in constant currency. Roughly 35% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 21% year-over-year. The remaining portion, recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 49%. And this quarter, our annuity mix was again 98%. FX was roughly in line with expectations on total company revenue, segment level revenue, COGS and operating expense growth. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $46.7 billion, ahead of expectations, and grew 27%, and 25% in constant currency. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage was slightly better than expected at 68%, down 2 points year-over-year from the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure, partially offset by continued efficiency gains in Azure and M365 Commercial Cloud. Company gross margin percentage was 69%, down 1 point year-over-year, driven by sales mix shift to Azure and the lower Microsoft Cloud gross margin noted earlier. Operating expenses increased 6% and 5% in constant currency, and operating margins increased 2 points year-over-year to 45%. Better-than-expected revenue growth coupled with a focus on operating efficiently drove the margin expansion. At a total company level, head count at the end of June was relatively unchanged year-over-year. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $33.1 billion and grew 16%, and 14% in constant currency, better than expected, driven by M365 Commercial products in cloud services and M365 Consumer products in cloud services. M365 Commercial Cloud revenue was ahead of expectations and increased 18%, and 16% in constant currency, with 2 points of benefit from in-period revenue recognition. Business trends remained relatively stable to the prior quarter when excluding the in-period revenue recognition, with ARPU growth again driven by E5 and M365 Copilot. Paid M365 commercial seats grew 6% year-over-year with installed base expansion across all customer segments, though primarily in our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings. M365 Commercial Products revenue increased 9% and 7% in constant currency, ahead of expectations due higher-than-expected Office 2024 transactional purchasing. M365 Consumer cloud revenue was better than expected, increasing 20% driven by ARPU growth following the January price increase and subscriber growth of 8%. LinkedIn revenue increased 9%, and 8% in constant currency, with growth across all businesses, though Talent Solutions continues to be impacted by weakness in the hiring market. Dynamics 365 revenue increased 23%, and 21% in constant currency, with strong execution in our core annuity sales motions leading to growth across all workloads. Segment gross margin dollars increased 16% and 15% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased slightly, driven by the efficiency gains noted earlier, even as we deliver more AI features across our products and scale our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 7%, and 6% in constant currency. And operating income increased 21%, and 19% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $29.9 billion and grew 26%, and 25% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by Azure and our on-premises server business. In Azure and other cloud services, revenue grew 39%, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by accelerated growth in our core infrastructure business, primarily from our largest customers. As a reminder, new cloud and AI workloads are built and scaled using the breadth of our services. Revenue from Azure AI services was generally in line with expectations. And while we brought additional data center capacity online this quarter, demand remains higher than supply. In our on-premises server business, revenue decreased 2%, and 3% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, primarily driven by transactional purchasing which also has higher in-period revenue recognition. Enterprise and Partner Services revenue increased 7%, and 6% in constant currency, with growth in Enterprise Support Services partially offset by a decline in Industry Solutions. Segment gross margin dollars increased 17%, and 16% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased 4 points year- over-year driven by scaling our AI infrastructure, partially offset by Azure efficiency gains noted earlier. Operating expenses increased 6%, and 4% in constant currency. And operating income grew 23%. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $13.5 billion and grew 9%, exceeding expectations, primarily due to Windows OEM as well as Xbox content and services. Windows OEM and Devices revenue increased 3% year-over-year, ahead of expectations, as inventory levels remained elevated. Search and news advertising revenue ex TAC increased 21% and 20% in constant currency, driven by continued growth in both volume and revenue per search, as well as roughly 8 points of favorable impact from third-party partnerships, including the benefit of a low prior-year comparable. And in Gaming, revenue increased 10%. Xbox content and services revenue increased 13%, and 12% in constant currency, driven by better-than-expected performance from first-party content and Xbox Game Pass. Segment gross margin dollars increased 15%. Gross margin percentage increased 3 points year-over-year with improvement across all businesses. Operating expenses increased 4%, and 3% in constant currency. Operating income increased 34%, and 33% in constant currency, driven by continued prioritization of higher margin opportunities. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures were $24.2 billion, including $6.5 billion of finance leases where we recognize the full value at the time of lease commencement. Cash paid for PP&E was $17.1 billion. The difference is primarily due to finance leases. More than half our spend was on long-lived assets that will support monetization over the next 15 years and beyond. The remaining spend was primarily for servers, both CPUs and GPUs, and driven by strong demand signals. Cash flow from operations was $42.6 billion, up 15%, driven by strong cloud billings and collections, partially offset by higher supplier payments. And this quarter, free cash flow was $25.6 billion. Other income and expense was negative $1.7 billion, primarily due to losses on investments accounted for under the equity method. Our effective tax rate was approximately 17%. And finally, we returned $9.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, bringing our total cash return to shareholders to over $37 billion for the full fiscal year. Now moving to our outlook. My commentary for both the full year and next quarter is on a U.S. dollar basis, unless specifically noted otherwise. Let me start with some full year commentary for FY '26. First, FX. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to increase full year revenue growth and COGS growth by approximately 2 points and to increase operating expense growth by 1 point. Next, building on the strong momentum we saw this past year, we expect to deliver another year of double-digit revenue and operating income growth in FY '26. We will continue to invest against the expansive opportunity ahead across both capital expenditures and operating expenses given our leadership position in commercial cloud, strong demand signals for our cloud and AI offerings, and significant contracted backlog. Capital expenditure growth, as we shared last quarter, will moderate compared to FY '25 with a greater mix of short-lived assets. Due to the timing of delivery of additional capacity in H1, including large finance lease sites, we expect growth rates in H1 will be higher than in H2. We remain focused on delivering revenue growth and increasing our operational agility. And as a result, we expect operating margins to be relatively unchanged year-over-year. And finally, we expect our FY '26 effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. Now to our outlook for the first quarter. Based on current rates, we expect FX to increase total revenue growth by 2 points. Within the segments, we expect FX to increase revenue growth by roughly 3 points in Productivity and Business Processes and roughly 1 point in Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing. We expect FX to increase COGS and operating expense growth by roughly 1 point. In Commercial bookings, we expect healthy growth on a growing expiry base. Bookings growth will again be driven by strong execution across our core annuity sales motions and long-term commitments to our platform. As a reminder, larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable on their timing, drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be roughly 67%, down year-over-year, driven by the impact of continuing to scale our AI infrastructure. We expect Q1 capital expenditures to be over $30 billion, driven by the continued strong demand signals we see. As a reminder, there can be quarterly spend variability from cloud infrastructure build-outs and the timing of delivery of finance leases. Next, to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue of USD 32.2 billion to USD 32.5 billion, or growth of 14% to 15%, with roughly 3 points of benefit from FX as noted earlier. In M365 Commercial Cloud, we expect revenue growth to be between 13% and 14% in constant currency, with business trends that remain relatively stable compared to the prior quarter. ARPU growth will again be driven by E5 and M365 Copilot. M365 Commercial Products revenue growth should be in the mid- to high single digits. As a reminder, M365 Commercial Products includes both the Windows Commercial on-premises components of M365 suites and Office transactional purchasing, both of which can be variable due to in-period revenue recognition dynamics. M365 Consumer Cloud revenue growth should be in the low 20s, driven by the January price increase. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the high single digits. And in Dynamics 365, we expect revenue growth to be in the high teens with continued growth across all workloads. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue of USD 30.1 billion to USD 30.4 billion, or growth of 25% to 26%, with roughly 1 point of benefit from FX as noted earlier. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which can have quarterly variability in year-on-year growth rates depending on the timing of capacity delivery and when it comes online, as well as from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q1 revenue growth of approximately 37% in constant currency, driven by strong demand for our portfolio of services on a significant base. Even as we continue bringing more data center capacity online, we currently expect to remain capacity- constrained through the first half of our fiscal year. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline in the low to mid-single digits with the ongoing customer shift to cloud offerings. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to be USD 12.4 billion to USD 12.9 billion. Windows OEM and Devices revenue should decline in the mid- to high single digits. We expect the elevated inventory levels at the end of Q4 to come down through the quarter in Windows OEM, although the range of potential outcomes remains wider than normal. Devices revenue should decline. Search and news advertising ex TAC revenue growth should be in the low to mid-teens, down sequentially as growth rates normalize following the benefit from third-party partnerships noted earlier. Growth will continue to be driven by volume and revenue per search across Edge and Bing. Overall search and news advertising revenue growth should be in the low double digits. And in Gaming, we expect revenue to decline in the mid to high single digits. Against a strong prior year comparable, we expect Xbox content and services revenue to decline in the mid-single digits. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS of USD 24.3 billion to USD 24.5 billion, or growth of 21% to 22%, and operating expense of USD 15.7 billion to USD 15.8 billion, or growth of 5% to 6%. Other income and expense is estimated to be negative $1.3 billion, primarily due to investments accounted for under the equity method. As a reminder, we do not recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on equity method investments. And lastly, we expect our Q1 effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. In closing, we finished the year with double-digit revenue and operating income growth and exceeded the FY '25 operating margin commitment we shared a year ago. Our focus remains on investing in security, quality and AI platform and product innovation that delivers value and opportunity to our customers. We are excited for FY '26.

I've been covering Microsoft for a while, I don't think I've ever seen a quarter where like everything came together this well. So congratulations on that execution. Maybe a little bit longer-term focused question to start out. You guys have always had software start-ups as customers and potentially emerging competitors. But the AI labs now feel different. Investors are ascribing valuations which assume these companies become major players in software. They're underwriting revenue forecasts measured in the tens of billions, if not hundreds of billions. And these start-ups have also grown to be some of your biggest customers, so they're contributing significantly to Microsoft today. So it seems like there's a lot of potential opportunity in supporting those businesses, but also it's not certain that they're going to stay your customers as they scale. They could in-source some of that infrastructure. And they very likely emerge as potential competitors. So as managers of Microsoft, as managers of the capital, how do you guys manage that risk versus reward with these quickly emerging AI labs and these AI start-ups?",198.0,98.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.030612244897959183,0.01020408163265306,0.05102040816326531,0.0,0.0,0.02040816326530612

There's always been, I'll call it, head apps or head -- new companies that emerge, that in fact are very needed in order to birth a new platform. Back in the day when I was getting started on Azure, I used to look over the lake and sort of see Netflix and Amazon, and I say, ""I wish Netflix ran on Azure."" And in some sense, that's kind of what we now have, which is the largest AI workloads run on Azure. And when that happens, you learn the workload faster, you optimize the entire platform faster, everything from what you're doing -- what we're doing with Cosmos DB for a chat interface like ChatGPT or Copilot, is, guess what, going to be the most relevant for any AI application going forward. The entire data stack that we have now built is going to be optimized for what people describe as one of the hardest challenges of any AI application, called context engineering, right, which is how do you collect your data and then make sure that the context around the problems remain stable over a long period so that you get the intelligence to actually deliver the results you want. So these are workload results that are invaluable for us to learn to build both the products as well as the platform. And then broadly, they -- or rather over time, there will be broad diffusion. In fact, one of the things that Amy and I track is not just the head app usage, but also what's the sort of all the Tier 2 applications that are being built. So that sort of -- that speaks a little bit, Keith, to I think your question, is as long as we have head apps shaping the platform and then, after that, we have the broad diffusion happen, which in some sense both of those is what we are seeing. So I feel very good about our being in decent standing going forward.",353.0,145.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.013793103448275862,0.027586206896551724,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.013793103448275862

I didn't know how you were going to beat last quarter, and you did it. So congratulations. Satya and Amy, we're now 2-plus years into the GenAI revolution and adoption is still early and ramping. What do you think is the best way that software companies are going to be able to monetize AI for SaaS? Do you believe there are differences in monetization for horizontal, more general apps like M365 Copilot or Dynamics CRM Copilot versus very targeted capacities on the agentic side? And also, how should you think about the trajectory of SaaS AI margins over the long term?",111.0,45.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.044444444444444446,0.0,0.022222222222222223,0.0,0.0,0.044444444444444446

I mean if I just broaden out beyond just SaaS as a category, I think just like the server-to-cloud transition was an expansion of essentially usage of servers. That is essentially what happened with the cloud, right, which is we did a bunch of servers except that the expertise required, the capital required, the time required to bring up servers, build it out, scale it, was just all hard. And so therefore, the market was a certain size. Whereas with the cloud, you could sort of buy it with flexibility, you could burst and you could spin up and spin down, the expertise required came down, so it was just -- orders of magnitude. That's what's happening. So if you sort of even subscribe to this point of view that intelligence is basically log of compute, that means compute is going to grow and you've got to use it as efficiently as possible to just keep creating intelligence. Now how does it manifest beyond just the infrastructure? I kind of, to Keith's earlier question, I talked a little bit about how the infrastructure is getting shaped, data layer is getting shaped, the app server is getting built. These are all classic categories of infrastructure that will continue, but there will be an order or 2 of magnitude more. So literally, like -- in fact, one of the other things we track is every GPU requires storage and compute. That ratio is another thing that is really exponential for infrastructure growth. So when you go to the app layer, the SaaS apps themselves are now building in effectively agentic and chat interfaces with intelligence. And they're also building autonomous agents. Agents are kind of like applications, like a database application perhaps, but they are being used increasingly inside of a user interaction. I think a good example is GitHub Copilot. It got started as code completions on an IDE. Then we added the chat interface to it. Then we added the Agent Mode to it. And now we have an autonomous agent, which in fact works completely asynchronously, right? So all those 4 things are now part of essentially GitHub. And by the way, it also turns out that every other tool that is also doing any form of coding is adding more and more GitHub repos. So if I have to think about GitHub monetization, we have an opportunity around just monetizing GitHub Enterprise and then we have the ability to think about GitHub Copilot, and GitHub Copilot as with all these form factors. And so that's exactly the same thing that's happening with Microsoft 365. That's the same thing that's happening with Dynamics 365. So you have to be very open to taking your data tier, your business logic tier and your UI tier and sort of being more expansive in it. As long as you do that, it's just that usage goes up, and that's what I think shows up in the results.",514.0,213.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.014084507042253521,0.004694835680751174,0.023474178403755867,0.004694835680751174,0.023474178403755867,0.009389671361502348

Hood,"And I think, Mark, if you wanted to think about all the things and the layers that you talked about, is really we're seeing very similar monetization tools exist in this transition too, right? There's a per user logic, there's tiers of per user. Sometimes those tiers relate to consumption, sometimes there's pure consumption models. I think you'll continue to see a blending of these. Especially as the AI model capability grows, you'll end up with ways that teams are going to want to throttle that usage, use the best models for the best job. And I think the blending of these models will continue to be something we see on a go-forward basis.",121.0,60.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.03333333333333333

I'm just wondering if you can comment on the plethora of customer conversations you've had, whether there are a couple of 2 or 3 specific catalysts that are driving that migration.

A good example would be what I referenced in my remarks with Nestle, with the SAP instances they moved, along with a lot of the data that's associated with it and a bunch of servers. So that's kind of a classic example. I think, whether it's VMware migrations or migrations of SAP, or even just our own server migrations, they're pretty healthy. And it turns out that we're still not anywhere close to the finish line, if at best, maybe in the middle innings of that. The second thing that's also happening is cloud-native applications that are scaling. This is even excluding all of the AI stuff, just the classic cloud native e-commerce company, let's say. These are scaling in a big way. And some of those customers were not on Azure previously, but now they're increasingly there, because they have come for AI perhaps but they now stay for more than AI. And so to me, that's another thing you see in overall, what's happening across the Azure number. And then, of course, there are the new AI workloads. So those are 3 things that are all, in some sense, building on each other, but that's kind of what's driving our growth.",226.0,92.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.021739130434782608,0.0,0.021739130434782608,0.0,0.0,0.021739130434782608

But I think what we are noticing in our own build-out of these AI applications and in general is the platform is becoming more than, ""Here is the model and here is an API. Make some calls,"" right? I mean that, in some sense, was a bit of the state-of-the-art maybe even a year ago. Whereas now you have essentially these very stateful app patterns that are emerging that require quite a bit of rethinking of even the app stack. I mean take even the storage tier stuff, right, the degree of sophistication you have, and hey, how much of an index do you really want to build by preprocessing so that your prompt engineering, or context engineering as I call it, can be better and higher quality? So I think all of that is emerging. So when I look at a product like Azure Search, Fabric and Cosmos DB, all of the things, the frameworks around it, are just becoming robust to build serious applications. And so that's what I feel great about, is the learning curve inside the company, outside the company, the diffusion of the stack, the speed with which that's emerging, that you can build applications, is much faster. I always go back and say, hey, when, I don't know, relational database came out, it took a while for people to build an ERP system, let's say.

You now have Analyst and Researcher, to just talk about 2 examples, and of course, people, all the third-party agents. So yes, there is a lot more of it's just not request, respond. It's about spawning essentially applications that then go do work and come back. But the UI still remains very important, right, even for asynchronous work. To instruct the asynchronous work, you need UI. And to monitor asynchronous work, you need UI. Maybe different, it may not be a chat interface. And of course, you need a way to then inspect what the asynchronous work is, right? So even take the example I was giving on GitHub. Even if you're not using GitHub Copilot to create the core check-in or the pull request, interestingly enough, we're seeing massive increase to GitHub Copilot Code Review Agent even if you used maybe Claude Code or whatever else to write the code. So that's I think what's happening across all of these systems. So you're absolutely right that you need -- it starts with some kind of a UI that's more chat focused, but it quickly goes beyond it.

So you did it. But what is the outlook? When I look at the CapEx guidance for the upcoming quarter, certainly, I would view that as a positive indicator of the book of business you have for your cloud services. But how should we think about the shape of the curve of CapEx vis-a-vis Azure growth rate in the years ahead, particularly as I listen to Satya's comments on the AI stack consuming more and more infrastructure? Are we at a point where we're going to have to continue to do this and we magically wait for inference and applications to kick in and, therefore, create a richer gross margin mix?

Let me back up and first say, when you think about the full year comments I've made on CapEx as well as the Q1 guidance of over $30 billion, you first have to ground yourself in the fact that we have $368 billion of contracted backlog we need to deliver, not just across Azure but across the breadth of the Microsoft Cloud. So in terms of feeling good about the ROI and the growth rates and the correlation, I feel very good that the spend that we're making is correlated to basically contracted on the books business that we need to deliver and we need the teams to execute at their very best to get the capacity in place as quickly and effectively as they can. And so when you look, and we've talked about the growth rate will decline year-over-year, but at its core, our investments, particularly in short-lived assets like servers, GPUs, CPUs, networking storage, is just really correlated to the backlog we see and the curve of demand. And I talked about, my gosh, in January and said I thought we'd be in better supply demand shape by June. And now I'm saying I hope I'm in better shape by December. And that's not because we slowed CapEx. Even with accelerating the spend and trying to pull leases in and get CPUs and GPUs in the system as quickly as we can, we are still seeing demand improve. And so I am not as focused, Kash, on trying to pick a date at which revenue growth and CapEx growth will meet and cross. I'm focused on building backlog, building business and delivering capacity, which we are seeing has a good ROI today in terms of our ability to get that done. So I don't want people to get overly focused on a pivot point. Because when you're in sort of these expansive moments, picking a data point usually means you're going to pick to be too conservative in terms of market share gain and in terms of winning.

I think one of the other things, Kash, is that -- I think I said this in the previous earnings as well, which is the difference between a hoster and a hyperscaler is software. And the same is going to be true here. That GPT4o example I gave is all software, right, the optimization even in the last year. So we know how to use the software skills to take any piece of hardware and make it multiple x better. And so that's kind of where the yield will come.

I think really the area to focus on is, when you think about margin, I think sometimes people get a lot of energy around cost control as a driver of margin. The other driver is to focus on making sure you deliver a great product that's competitive and innovative and can take share, because that drives revenue. And revenue itself, and revenue growth as you all know better, even perhaps than I do, is a durable way to see margin improvement. It builds on itself. That being said, the second thing I would point to is really what I talked to Kash a little bit about before, Satya and I both mentioned it, is applying all of our skill set here to deliver efficiencies, whether that's at whatever layer of the stack that exists, the S curves compound, and we are doing that work and we're focused on it at the same time we're doing the build out. So you'll see improvements there even as we continue to invest. And then, of course, it's about continuing to have great talent here focused on products and opportunities where we have the biggest markets and the most likelihood of success.

MSFT,2025-10-29,2025-10-30,,2025-10-29,2025-10-29T17:30:00-04:00,0,2025-10-29,prepared,,Satya Nadella,"Thank you, Jonathan. It was a very strong start to our fiscal year. Microsoft Cloud revenue surpassed $49 billion, up 26% year-over-year. And our commercial RPO increased over 50% to nearly $400 billion with a weighted average duration of only 2 years. We are seeing increasing demand and diffusion of our AI platform and family of Copilots, which is fueling our investments across both capital and talent. When it comes to infrastructure, we're building a planet scale cloud and an AI factory, maximizing tokens per dollar per watt while supporting the sovereignty needs of customers and countries. We are innovating rapidly across the family of Copilots spanning the high-value domains of information work, coding, security, science, health and consumer. And as you saw yesterday, we closed a new definitive agreement with OpenAI, marking the next chapter in what is one of the most successful partnerships and investments our industry has ever seen. This is a great milestone for both companies and we continue to benefit mutually from each other's growth across multiple dimensions. Already, we have roughly 10x-ed our investment. OpenAI has contracted an incremental $250 billion of Azure services, our rev share, exclusive IP rights and API exclusivity for Azure continue until AGI or through 2030. And we have extended the model and product IP rights through 2032. And we are also energized to innovate and pursue AI advancements with both talent and compute investments that have real-world impact. With that, let's turn to our momentum across our AI platform and Copilots as well as with agents. We have the most expansive data center fleet for the AI era, and we are adding capacity at an unprecedented scale. We will increase our total AI capacity by over 80% this year and roughly double our total data center footprint over the next 2 years, reflecting the demand signals we see. Just this quarter, we announced the world's most powerful AI data center, Fairwater in Wisconsin, which will go online next year and scale to 2 gigawatts alone. And we have deployed the world's first large-scale cluster of NVIDIA GB300s. We are building a fungible fleet that's been continuously modernized and spans all stages of the AI life cycle from pretraining to post training to synthetic data generation and inference. And it also goes beyond GenAI workloads to recommendation engines, databases and streaming. We're optimizing this fleet across silicon systems and software to maximize performance and efficiency. It's this combination of fungibility and continuous optimization that allows us to deliver the best ROI and TCO for us and our customers. For example, during the quarter, we increased the token throughput for GPT-4.1 and GPT-5, two of the most widely used models by over 30% per GPU. We also have the most comprehensive digital sovereignty platform. Azure customers in 33 countries are now developing their own cloud and AI capabilities within their borders to meet local data residency requirements. In Germany, for example, OpenAI and SAP will rely on Azure to deliver new AI solutions to the public sector. On top of this infrastructure, we are building Azure AI Foundry to help customers build their own AI apps and agents. We have 80,000 customers, including 80% of the Fortune 500. We offer developers and enterprise access to over 11,000 models more than any other vendor, including as of this quarter, OpenAI's GPT-5 as well as xAI's Grok 4. For example, Ralph Lauren used Foundry to build conversational shopping experience in its app, enabling customers to describe what they're looking for and get personalized recommendations. And OpenEvidence used Foundry to create its AI-powered clinical assistant which surfaces relevant medical information to physicians and help streamline charting. When it comes to our first-party models, we are excited by the performance of our new MAI models for text, voice and image generation, which debuted among the top in the industry leader boards. And we continue to make great progress with our Phi family of SLMs, which now have been downloaded over 60 million times, up 3x year-over-year. Beyond models in Foundry, we are providing everything developers need to design, customize and manage AI applications and agents at scale. Our new Microsoft Agent Framework helps developers orchestrate multi-agent systems with compliance, observability and deep integration out of the box. For example, KPMG used the framework to modernize the audit process, connecting agents to internal data with enterprise-grade governance and observability. These kinds of real production scale AI deployments are driving Azure's overall growth. And once again, this quarter, Azure took share. Now let's turn to applications and agents we ourselves are building on this platform. We now have 900 million monthly active users of our AI features across our products. And our first-party family of Copilots now has surpassed 150 million monthly active users across the information work, coding, security, science, health and consumer. When it comes to information work, we continue to innovate with Microsoft 365 Copilot. Copilot is becoming the UI for the agentic AI experience. We have integrated chat and agentic workflows into everyday tools like Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Teams. Just 9 months since release, tens of millions of users across Microsoft 365 customer base are already using chat. Adoption is accelerating rapidly, growing 50% quarter-over-quarter, and we continue to see usage intensity increased. This quarter, we also introduced Agent Mode, which turns single prompts into export quality Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentation and then iterate to deliver the final product much like agent mode in coding tools today. We're thrilled by the early response, including third-party benchmarks that rank it best-in-class. Beyond individual productivity, Copilot is multiplayer, with Teams mode announced this week, you can now invite colleagues into a Copilot conversation. And our collaborative agents like Facilitator and Project Manager, prep meeting agendas, take notes, capture decision, kick off group tasks. We are seeing a growing Copilot agent ecosystem with top ISVs like Adobe, Asana, Jira, LexisNexis, SAP, ServiceNow, Snowflake and Workday, all building their own agents that connect to Copilot. And customers are also building agents for their mission-critical business processes and workflows using tools like Copilot Studio and integrating them into Copilot. The overall number of agent users doubled quarter-over-quarter. And just yesterday, we announced App Builder, a new Copilot agent that lets anyone create and deploy task-specific apps and agents in minutes grounded in Microsoft 365 context. All this innovation is driving our momentum. Customers continue to adopt Microsoft 365 Copilot at a faster rate than any other new Microsoft 365 suite, all up more than 90% of the Fortune 500 now use Microsoft 365 Copilot, Accenture, Bristol-Myers Squibb, EY Global and the U.K.'s Tax and Payments and Customs Authority all purchased over 15,000 seats this quarter. Lloyds Banking Group has deployed 30,000 seats, saving each employee an average of 46 minutes daily. And a large majority of our enterprise customers continue to come back to purchase more seats. Our partner, PwC, alone added 155,000 seats this quarter and now has over 200,000 deployed across its global operations. In just 6 months, PwC employees interacted with Microsoft 365 Copilot over 30 million times, and they credit this agentic transformation with saving millions of hours an employee productivity. When it comes to coding, GitHub Copilot is the most popular AI pair programmer now with over 26 million users. For example, tens of thousands of developers at AMD use GitHub Copilot, accepting hundreds of thousands of lines of code suggestions each month and crediting it with saving months of development time. All up, GitHub is now home to over 180 million developers and the platform is growing at the fastest rate in its history, adding a developer every second. 80% of new developers on GitHub start with Copilot within the first week. Overall, the rise of AI coding agents is driving record usage with over 500 million pull requests merged over the past year. And just yesterday, at GitHub Universe, we introduced Agent HQ. GitHub Copilot and Agent HQ is the organizing layer for all coding agent, extending GitHub privatives like PRs, issues, actions to coding agents from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Cognition, xAI as well as OSS and in-house models. GitHub now provides a single mission control to launch, manage and review these agents, each operating from its own branch with built-in controls, observability and governance. We are building a similar system in security with over 3 dozen agents in Copilot integrated across Entra, Defender, Purview and Intune. For example, with our Phishing Triage Agent in Defender, studies show that analysts can be up to 6.5x more efficient in detecting malicious mails. In health, Dragon Copilot helps providers automate critical workflows. This quarter alone, we helped document over 17 million patient encounters, up nearly 5x year-over-year. More than 650 health care organizations have purchased our ambient listening tech to date, including University of Michigan Health where over 1,000 physicians are actively using it. Finally, when it comes to AI consumer experiences, we are excited about all the progress Copilot is making, starting with Windows. Every Windows 11 PC now is an AI PC. Just 2 weeks ago, we introduced new ways to speak naturally to your computer, including a Copilot wake word. With vision, Copilot sees what you see on your screen and you can have a real-time conversation about it. And with action, it takes real action on your behalf, interacting with both web and desktop apps. In Edge, we are introducing first-of-its-kind AI features to automate multistep workflows within the browser and help you pick up right where you left off. Edge now has taken share for 18 consecutive quarters. In Bing, our overview pages now include embedded conversational capabilities, we took share again in search. And daily users of our Copilot consumer app increased nearly 50% quarter-over-quarter. Among many updates we made last week is groups, which turns Copilot for the first time into a shared experience. We also are creating a great consumer subscription offer with Microsoft 365 premium. It brings together our Office applications and advanced Copilot features with high usage limits, giving individuals the flexibility to bring their own AI to work in a secure way. Finally, in gaming, Copilot provides a voice-first immersive experience across PC, mobile and our new Xbox Ally. Beyond our family of Copilots and AI platform, we are seeing strong momentum across the portfolio. Cloud migrations are accelerating. In data and analytics, Fabric revenue grew 60%, which is faster than any other data and analytics platform in the industry. We now have 28,000 paid Fabric customers. In databases, SQL, DB, hyperscale revenue was up nearly 75%, 50% in Cosmos DB. In Business Applications, Dynamics 365 gained share. In security, our end-to-end stack is now informed by 100 trillion daily signals. 1 billion monthly active users of Entra, 16 billion Copilot interactions audited by Purview, up 72% quarter-over-quarter. 40,000 Sentinel customers, and we took share across all categories we serve in security. In LinkedIn, nearly 1.3 billion members. And finally, in gaming, we expanded our reach across every endpoint focused on our high-margin content and services. We launched critically acclaimed games like Keeper, Ninja Gaiden 4 and Outer Worlds 2, reaching 155 million monthly active users. Minecraft, an all-time high, and set new record for overall content and services revenue for the quarter. We also saw a great response to Xbox Ally launch 2 weeks ago and set new records for players on PC. In closing, our planet-scale Cloud and AI factory together with Copilots across high-value domains is driving broad diffusion and real-world impact. And we continue to increase our investments in AI across both capital and talent to meet the massive opportunity ahead. With that, let me turn it over to Amy to walk through our financial results and outlook, and I look forward to rejoining for your questions.",1967.0,1065.0,26.0,3.0,7.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,0.024413145539906103,0.0028169014084507044,0.006572769953051643,0.0009389671361502347,0.0018779342723004694,0.0215962441314554
MSFT,2025-10-29,2025-10-30,,2025-10-29,2025-10-29T17:30:00-04:00,0,2025-10-29,qa,qna_heading,Amy Hood,"Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. First, as you heard from Satya, we were pleased to announce the next phase of our partnership with OpenAI yesterday. They continue to choose Microsoft to power their workloads. And together, we remain committed to driving innovation that meets real-world needs. Our Q1 results were not impacted by the deal signed this week. Now on to the quarter, we delivered a strong start to our fiscal year, exceeding expectations across revenue, operating income and earnings per share. We also saw continued share gains across many of our businesses, demonstrating our leadership position in key markets. This quarter, revenue was $77.7 billion, up 18% and 17% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased 18% and 16% in constant currency, while operating income increased 24% and 22% in constant currency. And earnings per share was $4.13 and an increase of 23% and 21% in constant currency when adjusted for the impact of our investments in OpenAI. FX impact was roughly in line with guidance. Company gross margin percentage was 69%, down slightly year-over-year, driven by investments in AI, including the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure and the growing usage of our AI product features. This was partially offset by ongoing efficiency gains, particularly in Azure and M365 Commercial cloud. Operating expenses increased 5% and 4% in constant currency, driven by investments in Cloud and AI engineering, including compute capacity and AI talent to support product development across the portfolio. Operating margins increased year-over-year to 49% and were ahead of expectations with stronger-than-anticipated results and high-margin businesses this quarter. When adjusted for the impact from our investments in OpenAI, other income and expense was $401 million as interest income more than offset interest expense, which includes the interest of payments related to data center finance leases. Capital expenditures were $34.9 billion, driven by growing demand for our Cloud and AI offerings. This quarter, roughly half of our spend was on short-lived assets, primarily GPUs and CPUs, to support increasing Azure platform demand, growing first-party apps at AI solutions, accelerating R&D by our product teams as well as continued replacement for end-of-life server and networking equipment. The remaining spend was for long-lived assets that will support monetization for the next 15 years and beyond, including $11.1 billion of finance leases that are primarily for large data center sites. And cash paid for PP&E was $19.4 billion. As a reminder, the difference between total CapEx and cash paid for PP&E is primarily due to finance leases as well as the normal timing of goods received, but not yet paid. Cash flow from operations was $45.1 billion, up 32%, driven by strong Cloud billings and collections, partially offset by higher supplier payments. And free cash flow increased 33% to $25.7 billion with minimal impact from a sequential increase in CapEx, given the higher mix of finance leases. And finally, we returned $10.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Now to our commercial results. Commercial bookings increased 112% and 111% in constant currency and were significantly ahead of expectations, driven by Azure commitments from OpenAI as well as continued growth in the number of $100 million-plus contracts for both Azure and M365. These results do not include any impact from the incremental $250 billion Azure commitments from OpenAI announced yesterday. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased to $392 billion and was up 51% year-over-year. The balance has nearly doubled over the past 2 years. And even with this growth, our weighted average duration has been relatively stable at approximately 2 years. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $49.1 billion, ahead of expectations and grew 26% and 25% in constant currency. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage was slightly better than expected at 68% and down year-over-year due to the investments in AI that were partially offset by ongoing efficiency gains as noted earlier. Now to segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $33 billion and grew 17% and 14% in constant currency. M365 Commercial Cloud revenue increased 17% and 15% in constant currency with 1 point of benefit from in-period revenue recognition. Year-over-year growth was driven by both ARPU and seats with ARPU growth again led by E5 and M365 Copilot. Paid M365 Commercial seats grew 6% year-over-year with installed base expansion across all customer segments though primarily in our small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings. M365 Commercial Products revenue increased 17% and 14% in constant currency, ahead of expectations due to higher-than-expected Office 2024 transactional purchasing. M365 Consumer Cloud revenue increased 26% and 25% in constant currency, again driven by ARPU growth. M365 consumer subscriptions grew 7% to over 90 million. LinkedIn revenue increased 10% and 9% in constant currency driven by Marketing Solutions. The Talent Solutions business was impacted by continued weakness in the hiring market. Dynamics 365 revenue increased 18% and 16% in constant currency with continued growth across all workloads. Segment gross margin dollars increased 19% and 16% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased driven by efficiency gains in M365 Commercial Cloud that were partially offset by investments in AI including the impact of growing usage in M365 Copilot chat. Operating expenses increased 6% and 5% in constant currency, and operating income increased 24% and 20% in constant currency. Operating margins increased 3 points year-over-year to 62%, driven by the higher gross margin noted earlier as well as improved operating leverage. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $30.9 billion and grew 28% and 27% in constant currency. In Azure and other Cloud services, where we continue to see accelerating demand, revenue grew 40% and 39% in constant currency. Results were ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected growth in our core infrastructure business, primarily from our largest customers. Azure AI services revenue was generally in line with expectations, and this quarter, demand again exceeded supply across workloads, even as we brought more capacity online. In our on-premise server business, revenue increased 1% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency. Results were ahead of expectations, driven by transactional purchasing of Windows Server 2025. Segment gross margin dollars increased 20% and 19% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased year-over-year, driven by investments in AI that were partially offset by efficiency gains in Azure. Operating expenses increased 4% and operating income grew 27%. Operating margins were 43%, down only slightly year-over-year as increased investments in AI were mostly offset by improved operating leverage. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $13.8 billion and grew 4%. Windows OEM and Devices revenue increased 6% year-over-year, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by strong demand ahead of Windows 10 end of support as well as a benefit from inventory levels that remain elevated. Search and news advertising revenue ex TAC increased 16% and 15% in constant currency, driven by growth in volume as well as the continued benefit from third-party partnerships that was better than expected. And in gaming, revenue decreased 2% and 3% in constant currency against a strong prior year comparable. Xbox content and services revenue increased 1% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency, driven by better-than-expected performance from third-party content. Segment gross margin dollars increased 11% and 10% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased year-over-year driven by sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 4% and 3% in constant currency, and operating income increased 18% and 16% in constant currency. Operating margins increased 3 points year-over-year to 30% driven by the higher gross margin noted earlier. Now moving to our Q2 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S. dollar basis. Based on current rates, we expect FX to increase total revenue growth by 2 points. Within the segments, we expect FX to increase revenue growth by 2 points in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud and 1 point in More Personal Computing. We expect FX to increase COGS and operating expense growth by 1 point. Starting with the total company, we expect revenue of USD 79.5 billion to USD 80.6 billion or growth of 14% to 16%. We expect COGS of USD 26.35 billion to USD 26.55 billion or growth of 21% to 22%. And operating expense of USD 17.3 billion to USD 17.4 billion, growth of 7% to 8%. Operating margins should be relatively flat year-over-year and down sequentially, aligned with historic seasonality. Now other income and expense. The combination of OpenAI's conversion to a public benefit corp and the ongoing nature of our partnership will result in increased volatility. Therefore, going forward, we'll provide our outlook, excluding any impact from our investments in OpenAI. On that basis, in Q2, other income and expense is estimated to be roughly $100 million as interest income will more than offset interest expense. And we expect our Q2 effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. Next, capital expenditures. With accelerating demand and a growing RPO balance, we're increasing our spend on GPUs and CPUs. Therefore, total spend will increase sequentially, and we now expect the FY '26 growth rate to be higher than FY '25. As a reminder, there can be quarterly spend variability from cloud infrastructure build-outs and the timing of delivery of finance leases. Next, our commercial business. In commercial bookings, we expect healthy growth in the core business on a low expiry base when adjusted for the OpenAI contracts in the prior year. And we expect commercial bookings will be positively impacted by the significant OpenAI commitments announced yesterday. As a reminder, larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be roughly 66%, down year-over-year, driven by the continued investments in AI as well as the mix shift to Azure. Now to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue of USD 33.3 billion to USD 33.6 billion or growth of 13% to 14%. In M365 Commercial Cloud, we expect revenue growth to be between 13% and 14% in constant currency, with business trends that remain relatively stable quarter-over-quarter. ARPU growth will again be driven by E5 and M365 Copilot. M365 Commercial products revenue growth should be in the low to mid-single digits. As a reminder, M365 Commercial products includes components that can be variable due to the in-period revenue recognition dynamics. M365 Consumer cloud revenue growth should be in the mid-20s driven by growth in ARPU. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth of approximately 10%. And in Dynamics 365, we expect revenue growth to be in the mid- to high teens with continued growth across all workloads. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue of USD 32.25 billion to USD 32.55 billion or growth of 26% to 27%. In Azure, we expect Q2 revenue growth of approximately 37% in constant currency as demand remains significantly ahead of the capacity we have available. And while we're accelerating the amount of capacity we're bringing online, we will continue to balance Azure revenue growth with the growing needs across our first-party apps and AI solutions, our own R&D efforts and the end-of-life server replacements. Therefore, we now expect to be capacity constrained through at least the end of our fiscal year. As a reminder, there can be quarterly variability in the year-on-year growth rates depending on the timing of capacity delivery and when it comes online as well as from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline in the low to mid-single digits with ongoing customer shift to cloud offerings. In More Personal Computing. We expect revenue to be in the USD 13.95 billion to USD 14.45 billion. Windows OEM and Devices revenue should decline in the mid-single digits. We expect continued momentum from Windows 10 end of support, although growth rates will be impacted by elevated inventory levels at the end of Q1 that we expect to come down through the quarter. Therefore, Windows OEM revenue should decline low to mid-single digits. The range of potential outcomes remains wider than normal. Devices revenue should decline year-over-year. Search and news advertising ex TAC revenue growth should be in the low double digits, down sequentially as growth rates normalize following the benefit from third-party partnerships noted earlier. Growth will continue to be driven by volume and revenue per search across Edge and Bing. And in Xbox content and services, we expect revenue to decline in the low to mid-single digits against the prior year comparable that benefited from strong first-party performance, partially offset by growth in subscriptions. And hardware revenue should decline year-over-year. And in closing, demand signals across bookings, RPO and product usage are accelerating faster than we expected. We're investing in infrastructure, AI talent and product innovation to capture that momentum and expand our leadership position. And we remain focused on delivering real value to our customers that results in durable revenue growth for the long term. With that, let's go to Q&A, Jonathan.",2118.0,1213.0,31.0,12.0,18.0,4.0,8.0,9.0,3.0,7.0,0.025556471558120363,0.00989282769991756,0.01483924154987634,0.0032976092333058533,0.006595218466611707,0.015663643858202802

And if I'm looking at Microsoft, this is 2 quarters in a row, we're really seeing results that are well ahead of anybody's expectations when we were thinking about this company a year ago or 5 years ago, 111% in Commercial bookings growth was not on anybody's bingo card, if you will, yet the stock is underperforming in the broader market. And the question I have is kind of getting at the zeitgeist that I think is weighing on the stock. And is something about to change? And I think AGI is kind of a nomenclature or a shorthand for that. And it's something that still included in your guys' OpenAI agreement. So Satya, when we think about AGI or we think about how application and computing architectures are changing, is there anything that you see on the horizon, whether it's AGI or something else, that could potentially change what appears to be a really strong positioning for Microsoft in the marketplace today where that strength will perhaps weaken on a go-forward basis. Is there anything that you're worrying about in that evolution and particularly the evolution of these generative AI models.",202.0,87.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.022988505747126436,0.04597701149425287,0.034482758620689655,0.0,0.0,-0.022988505747126436
MSFT,2025-10-29,2025-10-30,,2025-10-29,2025-10-29T17:30:00-04:00,0,2025-10-29,qa,,Satya Nadella,"Thank you, Keith, for the question. So here's what I would say, I think there are 2 parts. We feel very, very good about even this, I'd say, the new agreement that we now have with OpenAI because I think even, it just creates more certainty to all of the IP relationship we have as it relates to even this definition of AGI. But beyond that, I think your question touches on something that's pretty important, which is how are these AI systems going to truly be deployed in the real world and make a real difference and make a return for both the customers who are deploying them and then obviously, the providers of these systems. And I think the best way to characterize the situation is that even as the intelligence capability increases, let's even say, exponentially like model version over model version, the problem is it's always going to still be jagged, right? I think the term people use is the jagged intelligence, even -- or spiky intelligence, right? So you may even have a capability that's fantastic at a particular task, but it may not uniformly grow. So what is required is in fact, these systems, whether it is GitHub Agent HQ or the M365 Copilot system. Don't think of this as a product. Think of it as a system that in some sense smooths out those jagged edges, and really helps the capability. I mean just to give you a flavor for it, right? So if I am in M365 Copilot, I can generate an Excel spreadsheet. The good news is now an Excel spreadsheet does understand Office JS, has the formulas in it. It feels like, wow, it is a great spreadsheet created by a good model. The more interesting thing is I can go into agent mode in Excel and iterate on that model. And yet, it will stay on rail. It won't go off rail, it will be able to do the iteration. Then I can even give it to the analyst agent, and then it will even make sense of it like a data analyst would of our Excel model. The reason I say all of that is because that's the type of construction that will be needed even when the model is magical, all powerful. I think we will be in this jagged intelligence phase for a long time. So one of the fundamental things that these -- whether it's GitHub, whether it's security, whether it's M365, the 3 main domains we're in, we feel very, very good about building these as organizing layers for agents to help customers. And by the way, that's the same thing that we want to put into Foundry for our third-party customers. So that's kind of how people will build these multi-agent systems. So I feel actually pretty good about both the progress in AI. I don't think AGI as defined at least by us in our contract is ever going to be achieved anytime soon. But I do believe we can drive a lot of value for customers with advances in AI models by building these systems. So it's kind of the real question that needs to be well understood. And I feel very, very confident about our ability to make progress.",564.0,246.0,14.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,2.0,0.0,0.056910569105691054,0.016260162601626018,0.012195121951219513,0.0040650406504065045,0.0040650406504065045,0.04065040650406504

And I think you noted a number of $100 million contracts, not to go into a lot of detail, but can you just give us a sense of what you're seeing in that 51% RPO and 110-plus percent bookings growth that gives you confidence about what you're seeing in terms of the breadth and extent of some of these deals on a global basis.",78.0,35.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.02857142857142857,0.05714285714285714,0.02857142857142857,0.0,-0.02857142857142857

With a nearly $400 billion balance, we've been trying to help people understand sort of how to think about really the breadth of that. It covers numerous products. It covers customers of all sizes. It -- that's been a balance that we've been growing obviously at a good clip. But what people need to realize is it sits across multiple products because of the things Satya is talking about around creating systems and where we're investing. And if you're going to have that type of balance and then more importantly, have the weighted average duration be 2 years, it means that most of that is being consumed in relatively short order. People are not consuming, and I say this broadly, unless there's value. And I think this is why we keep coming back to, are we creating real-world value in our AI platforms, in our AI solutions and apps and systems. And so I think the sort of the way to think about RPO is it's been building across a number of customers. We're thrilled to have OpenAI be a piece of that. We're learning a ton and building leading systems because of it that are being used at scale that benefits every other customer. And so it's why we've tried to give a little bit more color to that RPO balance because I do understand that there have been a lot of concerns or questions about is it long dated, is it coming over a long period of time. And hopefully, this is helpful for people to realize that these are contracts being signed by customers who intend to use it in relatively short order.

Satya and Amy, I'd like to ask you the #1 question I receive, whether from investors or at AI conferences I attend, how much confidence do you have that the software, even the consumer [indiscernible] business can monetize all the investments we're seeing globally?

Let me talk a little bit about maybe connecting a couple of the dots because with $400 billion of RPO, that's sort of short-dated as we talked about, our needs to continue to build out the infrastructure is very high. And that's for booked business today. That is not any new booked business we started trying to accomplish on October 1, right? And so the way to think about that, and you saw it this quarter in particular, and as we talked about '26, the remainder, number one, we're pivoting toward -- increasingly, we talked about this short-lived assets, both GPUs and CPUs, Again, we talk about all these workloads are burning both in terms of app building. Now when that happens, short-lived assets generally are done to match sort of the duration of the contracts or the duration of your expectation of those contracts. And so I sometimes think when people think about risk, they're not realizing that most of the lifetimes of these and the lifetime of the contracts are very similar. And so when you think about having revenue and the bookings and coming on the balance sheet, the depreciation of short-lived assets, they're actually quite matched, Mark. And as you know, we've spent the past few years not actually being short GPUs and CPUs per se, we were short the space or the power is the language we used to put them in. So we spent a lot of time building out that infrastructure. Now we're continuing to do that also using leases. Those are very long-lived assets, as we've talked about 15 to 20 years. And over that period of time, do I have confidence that we'll need to use all of that, it is very high. And so when I think about sort of balancing those things, seeing the pivot to GPU, CPU short-lived, seeing the pivot in terms of how those are being utilized, we are -- and I said this now, we've been short now for many quarters. I thought we were going to catch up, we are not. Demand is increasing. It is not increasing in just one place. It is increasing across many places. We're seeing usage increases in products. We are seeing new products launch that are getting increasing usage, and increasing usage very quickly. When people see real value, they actually commit real usage. And I sometimes think this is where this cycle needs to be thought through completely is that when you see these kind of demand signals and we know we're behind, we do need to spend. But we're spending with a different amount of confidence in usage patterns and in bookings, and I feel very good about that. I have said we are now likely to be short capacity to serve the most important things we need to do, which is Azure, our first-party applications. We need to invest in product R&D and we're doing end-of-life replacements in the fleet. So we're going to spend to make sure that happens. It's about modernization. It's about high quality. It's about service delivery, and it's about meeting demand. And so I feel good about doing that, and I feel good that we've been able to do it so efficiently and with a growing book of business behind it.",584.0,246.0,6.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,0.024390243902439025,0.0,0.024390243902439025,0.012195121951219513,0.0040650406504065045,0.024390243902439025

The only thing I would add to what Amy captured was, if you sort of look out, there are 2 things that matter, I think, and that are critical in terms of how we think about our allocation of capital, also our R&D. One is how efficient is our planet-scale token factory, right? I mean that's at the end of the day, what you have to do. And in order to do that, you have to start with building out a very fungible fleet. It's not like we're building one data center in one region in the world that's mega scale. We are building it out across the globe for inference, for pre-training, for post-training, for RL, for data [indiscernible] or what have you. So therefore, that's the fungibility is super important. The second thing that we're also doing is continually modernizing the fleet. It's not like we buy one version of, say, NVIDIA and load up for all the gigawatts we have. Each year, you buy, you write the Moore's Law, you continuously modernize and depreciate it. And that means you also use software to grow efficiency. I talked about, I think, 30% improvement on both serving up GPT-4.1 and 5.0, right? That's software. That's sort of -- and by the way, it's helpful on A100s, it's helpful on GB200s, and it will be helpful on GB300s. That's the beauty of having the efficiency of the fleet. So keep improving utilization, keep improving the efficiency. So that's what you do in the token factory. The other aspect, which Amy spoke to is we have some of the best agent systems that matter in the high-value domains, right? It's in information work. That's the Copilot system. Coding, I mean, I should also say one of the things I like about Copilot is, I mean, Copilot ARPU is compared to M365 ARPUs, right? It's expansive. The same thing that happened between server and cloud like we used to always say, well, is it zero-sum, it turned out that the cloud was so much more expansive to the server market. The same thing is happening in AI because first, you could say, hey, our ARPUs are too low when it comes to M365 or you could say we have the opportunity with AI to be much more expansive. Same thing with tools, right? I mean, tooling -- the tools business was not like a leading business, whereas coding business is going to be one of the most expansive AI systems. And so we feel very good about being in that category. Same thing with security, same thing with health. So we have -- and in consumer, one of the things is it's not just about ads, it's ads plus subscriptions that also opens up opportunity for us. So when I look at the entirety of these high-value agent systems and when we look at the efficiency of and fungibility of our fleet, that's what gives us the confidence to invest, both the capital and the R&D talent to go after this opportunity.",536.0,215.0,14.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.06511627906976744,0.0,0.009302325581395349,0.009302325581395349,0.0,0.06511627906976744

I mean it goes back a little bit, Mark, to what I said about building first, the asset itself such that it's most fungible. And then to recognize the strength of even sort of our portfolio, we have a third-party business, we have a first-party business, we have third-party also spread between enterprise, digital natives, I always felt that we need a balance there because it may start with digital natives. They're always going to be the early adopters. You always have the hit app of the generation. And then -- essentially then it spreads throughout. The enterprise adoption cycle is just starting and so therefore, having the -- over the arc of time, I think that third-party balance of customers will only increase. But it's great to have the hit first-party apps in the beginning because you can build scale that then if it's a fungible and that's where the key is. You don't want to build for a digital native in -- as if you're just doing hosting for them. You want to build. That's where -- I think some of the decision-making of ours is probably getting better understood. What do we say yes to, what do we say no to. I think there was a lot of confusion, hopefully by now, anyone who switched on would figure this out. And so that's, I think, one thing we're doing on the third party. But the 1 -- first party is probably where a lot of our leverage comes and it's not even about one hit app on our first-party even. Our portfolio of stuff which I just walked through in the earlier answer, gives us, again, the confidence that between that mix, we will be able to use our fleet to the maximum. And remember, these assets, especially the data centers and so on are long assets, right? There will be many refresh cycles for any one of these when it comes to the gear. So I feel that once you think about all those dimensions, the concentration risk gets mitigated by being thoughtful about how you really ensure the build is for the broad customer base.",383.0,163.0,3.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,0.0,0.018404907975460124,0.006134969325153374,0.03680981595092025,0.0,0.0,0.012269938650306749

It's always hard to quantify precisely what would have been the revenue impact in quarter. But I would offer a way to think about it is Azure probably does bear most of the revenue impact. Because when you think about real priorities that you have to fill first, it's obviously the increasing usage and adoption and sales we've seen of M365 Copilot and the usage of Copilot chat, which we've seen very different patterns, which we're encouraged by. It's the adoption of security features. It's the GitHub momentum. And so when you're thinking about it, that is where and it is a priority for us to allocate resourcing there first. And so you are right to ask how do I think about that. We've worked very hard to try to mitigate it as best we can, but we have been short in Azure, and we've been clear on it. And I would say the other 2 priorities that I haven't mentioned maybe as much before is also just making sure our product teams and the AI talent that we've been able to hire into the company really over the past 1.5 years have access also to significant capacity because we're seeing it make the product better in a loop that is adding great benefit today into products people are using today for real-world work. And so we are making that a priority to make sure our research teams have that as well as our product engineering teams. And yes, it does impact Azure directly. That is the place where you see that prioritization.

There's talk that another hyperscaler came in and took away the business that was rightfully Microsoft's. I'm sure that there is a different point of view here. I'm wondering if you could offer some perspective on your criteria to -- is it about a certain volume of business that you wish to execute on the Microsoft paper? Or is it something broader than that, that I don't think maybe people fully appreciate the terminal value that Microsoft will have on its balance sheet at the end of these contracts, which I think is probably being underestimated as you have a full stack and you've got the multiple vectors to monetize, be it databases, Foundry. And to your point that you are a platform company, not just a hyperscaler.

So that's essentially what we have done. And so when some demand comes in shape, that don't fit that goal, where it's too concentrated, not just by customer, by location, by type of skewing, right? I think Amy mentioned some very key things. When you think about the margin profile of a hyperscaler, you've got to remember this, the AI accelerator piece, but there's compute, there's storage. And so if all of the demand just comes for just one [ meter ] that's really not a long-term business we want to be in. That's even from a third party. We have to balance it with all of our first-party stuff because that's after all a different margin stack for us. And then we have to fund our own R&D and model capability because in the long run, that's what's going to differentiate us. And so I look at all of those.
