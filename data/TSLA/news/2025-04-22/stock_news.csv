Bank of America is bullish on GOOGL, raising its price target to $200 per share from $185 with a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating attached. Citi also raised its price target on GOOGL to $200 in the wake of the company&#8217;s strong quarterly results. Piper Sandler predicts GOOGL price will hit $195 and has an &#8220;overweight&#8221; rating on shares. Wells Fargo analysts lifted their price target on the stock to $175 with an &#8220;equal weight&#8221; rating. GOOGL stock is currently hovering at $163 per share. Markets Attempt Gains 12:08 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The stock market is attempting to move higher, including a 0.36% gain in the Nasdaq Composite. Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOGL) is holding onto 2% gains while Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) is soaring by 8%, helping to lift the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite as autonomous driving makes its way closer to the mainstream. Tesla shares are up 24% over the past five-day stretch. Resilient Consumers 11:21 am by Gerelyn Terzo Consumer sentiment surprisingly improved toward the end of April amid a resilient consumer despite the tariff uncertainty. The University of Michigan published the final reading of its consumer sentiment index, which rose 52.2 compared with its initial view of 50.8 earlier this month. Economists were expecting the reading to remain flat. Nevertheless, the index fell sharply from March levels and has been on the decline in 2025. Today is the ex-dividend date for Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), CSW Industrials (CSWI) and Fastenal Company (Nasdaq: FAST). After a three-day winning streak, the markets are getting off to a slower start, with all three of the major stock market averages meandering between positive and negative ground this morning. Small-cap stocks are out front with a 2% jump in the Russell 2000 index. Google parent Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOGL) is tacking on 4% after yesterday afternoon&#8217;s strong earnings print. Mag 7 stock Alphabet beat consensus estimates on both the top and bottom lines, in response to which shares have been soaring ever since. Alphabet reported $2.81 per share on revenue of $90.2 billion compared with Wall Street estimates of $2.01 per share on revenue of $89.1 billion. Bank of America&#8217;s Michael Harnett is bearish on stocks due to the trade uncertainties, advising investors to remain defensive, sell the SPX/US$ rallies and buy price dips in gold. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 61.79 (-0.18%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 8.78 (-0.07%) S&amp;P 500: Down 5.01 (-0.09%) Tech Roundup Intel (Nasdaq: INTC) beat on the top and bottom lines with better than expected profits and revenue. But the markets are focused on the outlook, and Intel&#8217;s revenue guidance for the current quarter fell shy of consensus estimates, sending shares lower by 7% this morning. T-Mobile (Nasdaq: TMUS) shares are under pressure, falling 9% after the company revealed disappointing subscriber numbers in its quarterly print despite beating on the top and bottom lines. Pony AI (Nasdaq: PONY) shares are continuing their wild ride, soaring 17.7% today after yesterday&#8217;s double-digit percentage rally.

After spiraling by over 600 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished in the green, while the S&amp;P 500 similarly eked out a modest gain. The Nasdaq Composite finished slightly lower, but far from its worst levels of the day. While recession fears have been stoked now that the economy is officially slowing down, the markets shook it off, perhaps in anticipation of Meta (Nasdaq: META) and Microsoft&#8217;s (Nasdaq: MSFT) earnings this afternoon. Stocks Trim Losses 12:19 pm by Gerelyn Terzo President Trump has attributed the unexpected GDP contraction to the Biden Administration, surmising that economic growth will &#8220;take a while.&#8221; In the meantime, he urges Americans to stay patient as the next economic boom awaits. Stocks have trimmed their losses. NVDA a Sell 12:07 pm by Gerelyn Terzo One Wall Street firm has turned cautious on the AI boom. Seaport Research has reportedly downgraded shares of AI darling Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) to a &#8220;sell&#8221; rating, owing to worries about AI spending from businesses. Analyst Jay Goldberg believes that while Nvidia was a clear winner in the AI mania, the prospects are already built into the stock. Nvidia stock has shaved off 20% of its value year-to-date. The stock market has come off its lows of the day, with the Nasdaq Composite trimming its declines from approximately 3% to 1% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 are down fractionally. Today&#8217;s sell-off was sparked by an economic contraction in Q1, thrusting the possibility of a recession further into the spotlight. Markets Off Worst Levels 10:53 am by Gerelyn Terzo In what is shaping up to be an historic market sell-off, stocks have come off their worst levels of the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has trimmed its losses from over 600 points to about 400 points, while the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 are down by barely 2% each. In addition to the GDP shocker, the markets received more economic data to process from the labor market. Private payrolls rose by 62,000 in April, falling short of Dow Jones expectations for nearly double that growth. March saw a gain of 147,000 private payrolls, making the sting even worse. Companies are placing hiring on hold as they await the full impact of the Trump administration&#8217;s tariffs. Stock Market Drawdown 10:08 am by Gerelyn Terzo According to Goldman Sachs, if the economy were to slip into a recession, the stock market selling would intensify. Goldman Sachs Micro Strategist Vicky Chang warned that unlike past market cycles, this time around, headline risk signals the market bottom, not the economic trough, saying, &#8220;We still think there is significant vulnerability in a recession scenario, even if the worst of the underlying ‘shock’ has passed.&#8221; The economic slowdown is real. The U.S. economy contracted by 0.3% during Q1 2025 after corporate America rushed to receive imports before the tariffs kicked in. According to the Commerce Department, U.S. GDP declined at an annual rate of 0.3%, adjusted for inflation, the worst drop the economy has suffered in in three years. By way of comparison, economists were predicting an economic expansion of 0.4% in the first quarter, a far cry from the results as the tariff wars took hold. Stocks went into freefall mode in response, including a 600-point decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite spiraled by 2.7% and the S&amp;P 5oo lost 2.0%. Every single sector of the economy is trading lower as fears of an economic recession grip the markets. Each of the Magnificent Seven stocks are under pressure, including a steep 6% drop in Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) and declines of close to 4% for Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) and Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN). What a day for Meta Platforms (Nasdaq: META) to be reporting quarterly earnings after the closing bell today. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 646.83 (-1.6%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 454.57 (-2.6%) S&amp;P 500: Down 111.05 (-1.9%) Market Movers Starbucks (Nasdaq: SBUX) is losing 8% on the day and has been downgraded by Goldman Sachs to a &#8220;neutral&#8221; rating from &#8220;&#8216;buy&#8221; with a $85 price target attached, down from a previous target of over $100 per share. Starbucks reported Q1 results and missed Wall Street estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Social media platform Snap (NYSE: SNAP) is falling by over 15% this morning in the market sell-off after choosing to forego earnings guidance due to uncertainty from tariffs. First Solar (Nasdaq: FSLR) is losing 10% on the day after missing Q1 estimates and revealing the toll that tariffs will take on its revenue in 2025.

Not only is it one of the most purchased electric vehicles, but it’s also one of the best-selling vehicles overall. Between good looks, range, and a giant infotainment screen, the Tesla Model 3 has won over millions of customers to the electric world. Key Points The Tesla Model 3 is one of the best-selling electric vehicles in the country. Historically, there have been plenty of problems with Model 3 build quality. Full Self Driving has yet to show its promise for Model 3 owners. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Of course, having a large touchscreen alone doesn’t necessarily mean the Tesla Model 3 is worth owning. As with any popular car, the Model 3 has been hit with plenty of concerns and issues over the years, including the unique reputation of company CEO, Elon Musk, which may have you avoiding it for a competitor when you finish reading. 8. Buggy Software The Tesla Model 3 is reliant on the touchscreen. When it works, the idea of a vehicle receiving software updates like a phone or computer is incredible. There is no question that Tesla has set the stage for every vehicle manufacturer to rely on software updates for years to come, as software controls every vehicle function. Software Glitches Matter Even minor software glitches can be a big problem. Whether it’s a frozen screen or rebooting while parked, Tesla has positioned itself as cutting-edge, and sometimes this means aggravation. Suppose you don’t want to worry about this affecting your rearview camera, autopilot, or steering assistance. In that case, you might want to skip a vehicle that is so heavily reliant on improvements through software updates. 7. Image Perception The Tesla Model 3 has a CEO problem. Right now, the image of the Tesla Model 3 is one of danger, as Elon Musk has taken a polarizing position in the Trump Administration. Regardless of your feelings on the administration, there are frequent protests at Tesla dealerships due to Elon Musk being largely behind government job cuts. Can’t Ignore Politics Elon Musk has become increasingly controversial. There should never be a time when politics dictates which vehicle someone drives, but it’s hard to ignore what’s happening in the world. As a result, some people will resist buying a Tesla Model 3 as a form of protest over its CEO&#8217;s controversial public persona. Right or wrong, this is a reason people are not purchasing or selling their existing Model 3 vehicles. 6. Autopilot Cost Full Self Driving works, but isn&#8217;t as good as promised. Tesla and Elon Musk, in particular, have heavily touted using the Autopilot functionality as the Tesla Model 3’s most significant selling point. While this is true for most Tesla models, there are some instances in which Full Self Driving has led to accidents that should give you room to pause. Not Ready Yet The hope is that self-driving will work better in the future. Yes, you can use full self-driving, and, if you want it forever, you need to pay upward of $8,000 or more. This is a crazy high price for a feature that doesn’t come close to delivering on what was initially promised. You can’t let any car drive itself without significant concerns about harming others or other vehicles. 5. Minimalist Interior The Model 3 remains very sparse without buttons. There is no question that the increase in electric car popularity has caused vehicle manufacturers to consider minimizing the number of buttons inside a vehicle&#8217;s interior. Tesla took it to the extreme by limiting the number of buttons to as few as possible. While some buttons are on the steering wheel, most everything happens through the infotainment screen. No More Buttons The Model 3 has almost zero buttons besides the steering wheel. What’s annoying about this is that nearly every critical operation of the Tesla Model 3 takes place on the touchscreen. You must quickly glance at the screen for most operations, which means taking your hands off the wheel. This is opposed to being able to adjust climate control or vehicle sound without leaving the wheel. 4. Range Worries There are concerns with Tesla&#8217;s range. The overall range is one of the biggest reasons I worry about buying a vehicle like the Tesla Model 3. When you factor in how easy it is to gas up a car while on a road trip, you know you can get gas and return in minutes. Unfortunately, unless you buy a Model 3 strictly for driving around town, you must factor in range and charging. Long Charging Times Charging a Tesla can take some time, even with a Supercharger. Yes, you can recharge fairly quickly at a Tesla Supercharger station, but you have to be able to not only find a Supercharger station, but as these stations are still too few and far between, you have to get in line. Given that charging a vehicle can take 20-30 minutes, plus the time you might need to wait to access a charge, range worries are not something to ignore. 3. Cold Weather Performance Model 3&#8217;s lose range in the winter months. If you’re looking to buy an electric vehicle, the Tesla Model 3 will undoubtedly raise questions about how much range it will lose in colder weather. While reports vary, seeing a range drop by 20-30% in frigid weather isn’t something to ignore. Why This Matters Driving a Tesla in cold weather has tradeoffs. If you live in a warm-weather area like Florida or Southern California, you don’t have to worry about too much of a range impact based on cold weather. However, if you live anywhere in the Northern United States, this is a cold-weather staple, and range loss during the winter months may affect your plan, including how frequently you need to charge. 2. Costly Repairs Teslas have costly repairs. Should the time come when your Tesla Model 3 needs to be repaired, whether because of build quality concerns or some other repair need, you should expect high repair costs. Given the complex design of the Model 3, electric vehicles in general, and Tesla’s proprietary parts, sometimes you can see repair costs upward of 20% more than comparable vehicles. Why This Matters Tesla locations are only found in heavily populated areas. Nobody likes surprise expenses, and vehicle repairs can be among the most surprising and the biggest headaches. In other words, between Tesla’s still somewhat sparse repair network and repairs that can take longer than other dealerships, it’s a real pain in the you know what. 1. Build Quality Concerns Build concerns have plagued Tesla for years. Among the biggest reasons, if not the most important, to avoid the Tesla Model 3 is questionable build quality. This has been plaguing Tesla for years, and the company has not been able to address it in a way that has restored confidence in the Model. Why This Matters Tesla&#8217;s build concerns are still present, even years after launch. Build quality matters a great deal when you are spending thousands of dollars on a vehicle. There is a definite reason to skip the Model 3, between thinning paint and misaligned panels. Perhaps worst of all, there is a genuine concern over resale value for those who have purchased the Model 3.

Now the markets are gearing up to process quarterly earnings results from Ford (NYSE: F), whose stock fell 1.2% during regular market hours. Automakers have had a target on their backs for tariffs, and the markets will be looking for greater clarity on any impacts in Ford&#8217;s performance. Here&#8217;s how the major indices finished the day: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 69.52 (-0.17%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 132.40 (-0.74%) S&amp;P 500: Down 36.79 (-0.66%) America First Economy 12:38 pm by Gerelyn Terzo U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is speaking at the Milken conference today, addressing global investors about President Trump&#8217;s economic agenda.

Much of the tariff damage will unfold in the summer months as lower-priced inventories dwindle at businesses. The firm says consumers are between a rock and a hard place as tariff-related costs trickle down to them, a situation exacerbated by higher shipping costs.
