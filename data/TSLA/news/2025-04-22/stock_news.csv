All three of the major stock market indexes were sent reeling today, including an eye-popping 4% drop in the Nasdaq Composite. Right behind it was the Dow Jones Industrial Average, with nearly another 1,000-point drop, and the S&amp;P 500, falling 3.3%. President Trump is willing to extend the 90-day tariff relief, but it did little to lift the market sentiment today. Meanwhile, the trade war with China is only becoming more intense, with Fox Business reporting that President Trump is looking to delist China-listed companies from the U.S. stock market. Here&#8217;s a look at today&#8217;s damage: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 964.73 (-2.38%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 698.15 (-4.08%) S&amp;P 500: Down 181.50 (-3.3%) Tariff Fears Return 1:36 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The Nasdaq Composite&#8217;s 5.8% drop is being fueled by declines in Big Tech, including Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL), Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT), and Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN), which are each down between 4% and 7% today. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 is barreling toward circuit breaker status in which trading on the NYSE is halted to prevent further panic selling. President Trump is speaking with Cabinet members today on Capitol Hill while a U.S./China trade war fuels selling. Every sector of the economy is showing red today, including a 6.7% drop in energy stocks. Apple Falls 6% 11:52 am by Gerelyn Terzo Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) stock is falling by over 6% in today&#8217;s trading action. The declines come on the heels of the day in which it experienced its best trading day in nearly three decades. The broader market selling has intensified, sending the Nasdaq Composite spiraling by about 5%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lower by 3.4% and the S&amp;P 500 lower by 4.2%, erasing much of yesterday&#8217;s gains. Tariffs are easing while inflation is falling, but stocks are still spooked. Roller Coaster Ride 10:06 am by Gerelyn Terzo Stocks remain under pressure as of mid-morning trading, including a 3.2% drop in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite after yesterday&#8217;s historic performance. The easing tariffs have failed to lift market sentiment today. Used-car platform CarMax (NYSE: KMX) is falling 14% after a disappointing fiscal Q4 earnings print. Taiwan Semi (TSMC) is falling by 3%. Trump Media (Nasdaq: DJT) is falling 1%. U.S. Steel (NYSE: X) is falling by 7.3%. The markets opened in a sea of red on the heels of yesterday&#8217;s historic rally. Today these skittish markets are taking back some of those gains after investors followed President Trump&#8217;s advice to buy the dip. Despite tariff relief, all three of the major stock market averages went south, with Big Tech names dragging the Nasdaq Composite lower. Most sectors of the economy were under pressure in early trading, including declines of over 3% each in energy and tech. Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) is down 3% this morning. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said on CNBC that the current market environment could be a tailwind for acquisitions. He also believes sellers on the e-commerce platform would pass along tariff costs to consumers. The company continues to invest heavily in AI. The markets has the opportunity to shift their attention from tariffs to inflation this morning. In a dose of good news, the Labor Department&#8217;s latest inflation print came in cooler than expected, with consumer prices easing to 2.4% in the 12-month stretch leading up to March, compared with economists expectations of 2.6%. On a monthly basis, the CPI declined by 0.1% last month after climbing higher by 0.2% in February, a welcome shift. Historically, March inflation generally increases, with this year marking a notable shift in the trend. Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 706.27 (-1.74%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 478.08 (-2.7%) S&amp;P 500: Down 117.81 (-2.16%) Market Movers Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) stock is off 5% today. The company has begun selling its EVs in Saudi Arabia where it is hoping to drive a social shift in the oil-rich Kingdom that is dependent on fossil-fueled powered vehicles. Cognizant Technology Solutions (Nasdaq: CTSH) is falling by 3% today after inking a partnership deal with OMRON&#8217;s automation business products. With a market cap of $34.8 billion, CTSH pays a dividend yield of 1.8%. Energy stocks are also under pressure, including Constellation Energy (Nasdaq: CEG), which is falling by 3.5% today. The stock is up over 10% in the past five days and is experiencing profit taking today though it remains above the $200 threshold.

This rebound follows China&#8217;s imposition of 125% tariffs on U.S. products, contributing to persistent uncertainty after a turbulent week sparked by U.S. tariff announcements. The stock market is shrugging off the latest salvo between the U.S. and China over trade. All stock indices opened slightly higher at the morning bell, with the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO) up 0.7%. China raised its tariffs on U.S. goods to 125%, matching the rate President Trump had imposed on Chinese imports. Beijing, though, said it no longer matters what further increases the U.S. hits it with as it will not respond because &#8220;Given that, at the current tariff level, U.S. exports to China are no longer commercially viable, China will not respond to any further tariff hikes by the U.S. on Chinese goods.&#8221; With Trump having essentially eliminated the de minimis rule that Chinese marketplaces like Temu and Schein used to ship cheap goods to the U.S. duty-free, it&#8217;s not unreasonable to say trade between the U.S. and China is dead. Big names bolster market Although most components of the Vanguard ETF are down, the biggest components of the index are moving higher. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), representing the second largest position in the exchange-traded fund at over 6%, is up more than 2%, helping to drive the ETF higher. Even though top dog Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is in the red, it is almost at break-even so its impact is negligible. Yet some components are up strongly in morning trading. Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), which is the eighth largest position, is up 3.4%. The AI chipmaker&#8217;s stock has held up better than most over the tumultuous week with shares 22% higher. Banking on trading turmoil What is buoying stocks this morning are the results of bank stock earnings starting to come in with giants like JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) reported record revenue on higher trading despite caution over economic headwinds. JPM stock represents 1.5% of VOO&#8217;s portfolio, just behind 10th place Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) at 1.6%. JPMorgan is up 2% in morning trading. Other financial stocks in the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF that reported earnings today include Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), both of which had better than expected results. Yet banks were also being very cautious and were setting aside larger amounts for credit losses. It suggests they foresee tougher times coming and are preparing for the worst. JPMorgan&#8217;s provision for credit losses in the fourth quarter rose to $3.3 billion from $2.6 billion. Wells Fargo&#8217;s provision, however, was lower than expected. It set aside $932 million, less than the $1.2 billion Wall Street wass anticipating. Morgan Stanley&#8217;s credit loss provision was just $135 million, but it is markedly higher than the $6 million et aside in its year-ago first quarter.

Chairman Powell warned that tariffs could throw a wrench into the central bank&#8217;s efforts to tame inflation and spur economic growth. The Fed is taking a wait-and-see approach to monetary policy in the meantime. The Nasdaq Composite is spiraling 4% lower, weighed down by a 9% drop in Nvidia (Nasdaq; NVDA) and other Big Tech names on the tariff fallout. All sectors of the economy are lower with the exception of energy, which is up 1% as a group. Here&#8217;s a look at where things stand as of late afternoon trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 847.60 (-2.10%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 713.07 (-4.24%) S&amp;P 500: Down 161.77 (-3%) Gainers in a Sea of Red 12:32 pm by Gerelyn Terzo While the markets are a sea of red, including a 2.1% drop in the Nasdaq Composite, there are some gainers if you dig deep enough. We found a few, including: eBay (Nasdaq: EBAY) is up 2.5% on the day and is inching closer to its 52-week high of approximately $71 per share. The online auction platform could be gaining from a newly announced partnership with Checkout.com for payments. Bitcoin stock MicroStrategy (Nasdaq: MSTR) is tacking on 1.2% today while the bitcoin price continues to hover below the $85,000 level. On its best day, bitcoin serves as an inflationary hedge from the economy, which stands to benefit MSTR stock. Expand Energy (Nasdaq: EXE) is gaining 1.7% as a rising energy sector lifts those boats. Tariff Fallout 10:04 am by Gerelyn Terzo The markets remain under pressure as of mid-morning trading, with the three major stock market averages stuck in a rut. While March retails sales rose a higher than expected 1.4%, the markets are obsessed with Nvidia (Nasdaq; NVDA), which warned that it will take a massive $5.5 billion charge for processor exports to China, giving the markets their &#8216;I told you so&#8217; moment. Magnificent Seven stocks are each down in the ballpark of 2% this morning, including Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL), whose market cap has dipped below the $3 trillion threshold. The markets are under pressure out of the gate despite stronger than anticipated economic data. All three of the major stock market averages are trading in the red, including a 1.7% drop in the Nasdaq Composite, which is being weighed down by Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA). On the flip side, Applied Digital (Nasdaq: APLD) is gaining 5% today, bucking the otherwise downward trend, on the heels of its fiscal Q3 results. Despite missing Wall Street&#8217;s expectations, Applied Digital is benefiting from its roll in data center infrastructure for AI and high-performance computing, two white-hot tech trends. The gold price is rising 2.4% today to $3,319.30 per ounce as investors flock to the inflationary hedge during these times of heightened uncertainty. Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM) is gaining 4% on the day as a beneficiary of the gold rush. The technology sector is being dragged lower by NVDA stock after the company revealed an upcoming $5.5 billion charge related to chip exports to China, igniting trade war selling once again. Nvidia shares are sinking 5.6% today. Most sectors of the economy are down, including a 2.4% decline for technology, while energy stocks are up by 1%. Each of the Magnificent 7 stocks is lower today. Retail sales grew by 1.4% in March, stronger than the expected 1.2% increase and providing yet another sign of a resilient U.S. consumer. Results excluding auto sales also beat economist projections, coming in at 0.5% vs. estimates of 0.3% even in the face of tariff uncertainty targeting the auto sector. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 165.73 (-0.41%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 292.95 (-1.74%) S&amp;P 500: Down 47.89 (-0.90%) Market Movers BofA analysts have reiterated their &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on Nvidia stock, but it&#8217;s doing little to lift sentiment in shares today. The Wall Street firm also lowered their price target on NVDA to $160 from $200 per share, blaming tariff uncertainty. Oppenheimer analysts have begun coverage on new stock Reddit (NYSE: RDDT) with an &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating attached. Piper Sandler likes Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) stock, reiterating its &#8220;overweight&#8221; rating on the EV maker while lowering the price target from $450 to $400 per share.

U.S. to Isolate China 12:53 pm U.S. authorities are preparing to engage in talks with over 70 countries, urging them to block Chinese goods from passing through their territories, according to the WSJ. The U.S. aims to economically &#8220;cut off&#8221; China. This aligns with President Trump&#8217;s recent statement suggesting nations might need to choose between aligning with the U.S. or China. The approach seems to focus on fully isolating China, while China has pledged to stand firm. Technology Stocks Upgrades and Downgrades 11:00 am MSFT (Microsoft) Downgrade Details: BMO Capital reduced price target from $490 to $470, maintains Outperform rating. Reason: Slower growth in Azure&#8217;s legacy cloud business due to weaker economy, leading to reduced Azure growth estimates for next few quarters and FY26. Insight: Experts indicate slowdown in core legacy cloud businesses. BMO suggests lower capex intensity in FY26 could be a positive catalyst for shares. NVDA (Nvidia) Issue: U.S. Government now requires licenses to ship H20/equivalent AI chips to China and arms-embargoed countries. Nvidia announced $5.5B charge in fiscal Q1 for inventory, purchase commitments, and reserves. Impact: Charge suggests high likelihood of H20 restrictions and low chance of future licenses. Q1 GAAP EPS may take a 20% hit, but non-GAAP sales/EPS less affected. Analyst View: BofA calls restriction &#8220;unwelcome but somewhat expected,&#8221; deems risk &#8220;manageable.&#8221; Maintains Buy rating, but lowered price target from $200 to $160. MRVL (Marvell) Downgrade Details: BofA cut price target from $120 to $72, retains Buy rating. Context: Expects Q1 results to beat due to conservative outlooks and tariff-related demand pull-ins. However, tariffs pose risks: Modest tariffs: 4%-6% sales hit, 12%-13% EPS hit. Deeper tariffs: 9% and 12% sales decline in 2025 and 2026, respectively. Reason: Lowered targets across semis coverage due to growing tariff uncertainty. TSLA (Tesla) Downgrade Details: Piper Sandler reduced price target from $450 to $400, maintains Overweight rating. Reason: Q1 deliveries (337,000 units) missed consensus, likely pushing gross margins to multi-year lows. Lack of clarity on Model 2 specs/pricing hinders reliance on new products for growth. Outlook: Short-term bearish due to weak Q1 financials, but &#8220;big picture&#8221; catalysts could drive sharp rallies. Estimates cut to reflect challenging near-term outlook. The semiconductor sector’s woes are hammering tech ETFs, with funds heavy in Nvidia and other chipmakers leading the market’s slide. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), packed with names like Nvidia, AMD, and ASML, cratered over 3.75% after the U.S. tightened export controls on AI chips to China. Nvidia, the ETF’s top holding, warned of a $5.5 billion charge as its H20 processors now require export licenses. The restrictions also hit AMD as the company export controls to apply to MI308 products, resulting in $800 million. Both stocks plunging close to 6% so far today. ASML, a key supplier of chip-making equipment, sank 5.75% after dismal order numbers and tariff warnings. Nasdaq Composite: -1.76% S&amp;P 500: -1.00% Dow Jones Industrial Average: -0.42% Today&#8217;s selling pressure raised the CBOE VIX index 3% after market fear dissipated the past two days.

By turning him into a financial trading wizard, the drug propels him into the stratosphere of high finance. As Eddie relishes his luxurious lifestyle and newfound respect and admiration, he becomes addicted to the drug, the money, and the power, despite increasing mental blackouts, unexplained gaps in his memory, and the threat of mobsters seeking to steal the drug from him. While not a primary aspect of the plot, the underlying theme of addiction in multiple forms is reiterated on several levels while the escalation of the cycle and the difficulty in jumping off the carousel is also explored. It becomes a trap for Eddie, since the fear of returning to his previously humble and failing life outweighs the growing memory and mental problems being triggered by the drug. The threats to Eddie’s life by the Russian mob finally shock him into the realization as to how much else he risks by staying on the ever spinning hamster wheel he has created for himself. The fast track grind is unrelenting, and the temptation to remain on it often outweighs more rational concerns for one’s own mental and physical well-being. Just like a drug addiction, the craving for the momentary thrills of making big profits or collecting big paychecks subsumes common sense safeguards and rational behavior. Combating burnout, especially when finances are not the sole motivation, becomes trickier in identifying the causes and devising the solutions. Key Points The fast lane of 8-figure plus sized deals can be seductive and addictive, becoming a continuous cycle that is difficult to leave. Even with the commensurate financial rewards from a successful career managing huge sums, finding personal fulfillment on a deeper level can elude many who stay in the fast lane. A broader definition and discussion of the nature of success can be helpful in dealing with the pressure and mental toll from the challenges of maintaining the hamster wheel.

Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) “Maybe FatFIRE Isn’t About Freedom. Maybe It’s Just Wage Slavery In A Gucci Suit.” The inability to leave the fast track grind after building a net worth of $80 million indicates underlying deep seated insecurities and a prospective psychological and emotional burnout and meltdown. Surprisingly, some people who have achieved profound success can lament about how it’s not all it’s cracked up to be. A Reddit fan who is probably in the top 10% of the 1% richest people posted his personal impressions on the emptiness of reaching the pinnacle of the pyramid. His details were as follows: The poster claims his net worth is roughly $80 million. His assets include multiple liquid forms (i.e. stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) as well as private equity. The poster’s business is self-owned, so he has no boss, no Key Performance Indicator (KPI) metric hanging over his head, and no fixed 9-5 office hours. Contrary to his expectations, his success seems to have only migrated him to the same type of obligations and daily grind as when he was an employee. He finds his current situation is giving him the same stress and optimization addictions, albeit with “better wine, fancier vacations, and the illusion of control.” While no longer managing the funds of clients, the poster is now managing his own portfolio, putting him in the role of “CFO of his personal empire”, with added pressures and no other life beyond work. Ironically, he finds that the pursuit of FatFIRE (Financial Independence Retire Early) has left him stuck on the hamster wheel, irrationally paranoid of becoming irrelevant if he jumps off. Redefining Success The first step in ending an addiction to the fast track is to consciously take a step back to reassess priorities and find oneself, which is something more than a job or its title. As one might expect, the range of responses was very broad. A number of the responses thought it was a LARP (Live Action Role Play) hoax, with some accusing the poster of actually being a ChatGPT Bot. Others were incredulous, finding the poster’s complaints to be hysterically funny, and thinking it was a ridiculous attempt at virtual signaling for victimhood amidst his $80 million accumulated wealth. Several unsympathetic respondents shot back with a mix of envy and resentment: “At $80 million, you’re working for your ego.” “Ego grows faster than wealth.” “Narcissists are in a prison of their own making.” “You need a life. Go find one.” “The problem is you.” “Cry me a river.” “If it helps you feel better, you’re already irrelevant.” “You made your business your personality and your identity. We all need something to bring us joy other than our job title.” To be fair to the skeptics, the poster apparently had posted 6 months ago asking for investment advice to allocate monthly savings to set up accounts for his kids. It’s doubtful that someone who legitimately has amassed $80 million net worth would not have professional financial advisors and estate planners under retainer already for such a purpose. That said, the topic is certainly a legitimate one that is not without precedent. There were some constructive critiques and helpful suggestions posted in response that are good food for thought: One respondent suggested a redefinition of success to extend beyond simply one’s self and making money to have consideration for others. Satisfaction can be found in creating a legacy to help one’s family for future generations. Type-A personalities who relish competing with their peers often don’t know how to live any other way, so taking a break to reset and assess priorities can offer some sorely needed respite. One respondent psychoanalyzed the poster as existentially running from death and filling the void with activity. Anxiety is expressed by the inability to say “no” to another board seat, etc. The RE part of FIRE is to retire into something with meaning. Not just quit your job once you’ve got enough cash. A former pro athlete advised that the only way to take the retirement plunge is to consciously take the step and be honest with yourself to help work through the reinvention process. Having a wealthy financial situation that affords one retirement options can include such activities as: Angel Investing, advising, charitable foundation management, as well as diversions, like travel, hobbies, meditation, fitness, and spending quality time with family and friends. From someone who conquered being in a similar predicament: Freedom isn’t absolute &#8211; it’s a spectrum we negotiate, often unconsciously. Unpacking the real you demands deep introspection and a step back from the C-suite treadmill. Unplug, strip away the noise, and rediscover your own voice. The stakes are low &#8211; you can always return to the grind if it calls. For you &#8211; success is the baseline. The real challenge is redefining it on your terms. Step off the track and recalibrate &#8211; the returns will outpace anything you’ve pitched in the boardroom. One respondent who had attained a similar net worth exited and put his holdings into 80/20 (growth/income) funds so he would have the freedom to travel, spend time with family, learn new skills and play video games. Several who lauded the poster’s choice to stay in the grind pointed out these observations: People who think it’s about ego are off-base. We work for our FUTURE SELVES, and our family. Jeff Bezos had to ask himself “What happens on Day 2?” after he retired from Amazon. Fearing Day 2 means the decision has yet to be truly made. It’s easier to decide to DO something than NOT to do something. If Elon quit after making $180 million with PayPal, we would never have Tesla, X, Starlink, SpaceX, or The Boring Company, so there’s nothing wrong with staying in the game when others might have dropped out earlier.

The University of Michigan published the final reading of its consumer sentiment index, which rose 52.2 compared with its initial view of 50.8 earlier this month. Economists were expecting the reading to remain flat. Nevertheless, the index fell sharply from March levels and has been on the decline in 2025.

After spiraling by over 600 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished in the green, while the S&amp;P 500 similarly eked out a modest gain. The Nasdaq Composite finished slightly lower, but far from its worst levels of the day. While recession fears have been stoked now that the economy is officially slowing down, the markets shook it off, perhaps in anticipation of Meta (Nasdaq: META) and Microsoft&#8217;s (Nasdaq: MSFT) earnings this afternoon. Stocks Trim Losses 12:19 pm by Gerelyn Terzo President Trump has attributed the unexpected GDP contraction to the Biden Administration, surmising that economic growth will &#8220;take a while.&#8221; In the meantime, he urges Americans to stay patient as the next economic boom awaits. Stocks have trimmed their losses. NVDA a Sell 12:07 pm by Gerelyn Terzo One Wall Street firm has turned cautious on the AI boom. Seaport Research has reportedly downgraded shares of AI darling Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) to a &#8220;sell&#8221; rating, owing to worries about AI spending from businesses. Analyst Jay Goldberg believes that while Nvidia was a clear winner in the AI mania, the prospects are already built into the stock. Nvidia stock has shaved off 20% of its value year-to-date. The stock market has come off its lows of the day, with the Nasdaq Composite trimming its declines from approximately 3% to 1% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 are down fractionally. Today&#8217;s sell-off was sparked by an economic contraction in Q1, thrusting the possibility of a recession further into the spotlight. Markets Off Worst Levels 10:53 am by Gerelyn Terzo In what is shaping up to be an historic market sell-off, stocks have come off their worst levels of the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has trimmed its losses from over 600 points to about 400 points, while the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 are down by barely 2% each. In addition to the GDP shocker, the markets received more economic data to process from the labor market. Private payrolls rose by 62,000 in April, falling short of Dow Jones expectations for nearly double that growth. March saw a gain of 147,000 private payrolls, making the sting even worse. Companies are placing hiring on hold as they await the full impact of the Trump administration&#8217;s tariffs. Stock Market Drawdown 10:08 am by Gerelyn Terzo According to Goldman Sachs, if the economy were to slip into a recession, the stock market selling would intensify. Goldman Sachs Micro Strategist Vicky Chang warned that unlike past market cycles, this time around, headline risk signals the market bottom, not the economic trough, saying, &#8220;We still think there is significant vulnerability in a recession scenario, even if the worst of the underlying ‘shock’ has passed.&#8221; The economic slowdown is real. The U.S. economy contracted by 0.3% during Q1 2025 after corporate America rushed to receive imports before the tariffs kicked in. According to the Commerce Department, U.S. GDP declined at an annual rate of 0.3%, adjusted for inflation, the worst drop the economy has suffered in in three years. By way of comparison, economists were predicting an economic expansion of 0.4% in the first quarter, a far cry from the results as the tariff wars took hold. Stocks went into freefall mode in response, including a 600-point decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite spiraled by 2.7% and the S&amp;P 5oo lost 2.0%. Every single sector of the economy is trading lower as fears of an economic recession grip the markets. Each of the Magnificent Seven stocks are under pressure, including a steep 6% drop in Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) and declines of close to 4% for Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) and Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN). What a day for Meta Platforms (Nasdaq: META) to be reporting quarterly earnings after the closing bell today. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 646.83 (-1.6%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 454.57 (-2.6%) S&amp;P 500: Down 111.05 (-1.9%) Market Movers Starbucks (Nasdaq: SBUX) is losing 8% on the day and has been downgraded by Goldman Sachs to a &#8220;neutral&#8221; rating from &#8220;&#8216;buy&#8221; with a $85 price target attached, down from a previous target of over $100 per share. Starbucks reported Q1 results and missed Wall Street estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Social media platform Snap (NYSE: SNAP) is falling by over 15% this morning in the market sell-off after choosing to forego earnings guidance due to uncertainty from tariffs. First Solar (Nasdaq: FSLR) is losing 10% on the day after missing Q1 estimates and revealing the toll that tariffs will take on its revenue in 2025.

Not only is it one of the most purchased electric vehicles, but it’s also one of the best-selling vehicles overall. Between good looks, range, and a giant infotainment screen, the Tesla Model 3 has won over millions of customers to the electric world. Key Points The Tesla Model 3 is one of the best-selling electric vehicles in the country. Historically, there have been plenty of problems with Model 3 build quality. Full Self Driving has yet to show its promise for Model 3 owners. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Of course, having a large touchscreen alone doesn’t necessarily mean the Tesla Model 3 is worth owning. As with any popular car, the Model 3 has been hit with plenty of concerns and issues over the years, including the unique reputation of company CEO, Elon Musk, which may have you avoiding it for a competitor when you finish reading. 8. Buggy Software The Tesla Model 3 is reliant on the touchscreen. When it works, the idea of a vehicle receiving software updates like a phone or computer is incredible. There is no question that Tesla has set the stage for every vehicle manufacturer to rely on software updates for years to come, as software controls every vehicle function. Software Glitches Matter Even minor software glitches can be a big problem. Whether it’s a frozen screen or rebooting while parked, Tesla has positioned itself as cutting-edge, and sometimes this means aggravation. Suppose you don’t want to worry about this affecting your rearview camera, autopilot, or steering assistance. In that case, you might want to skip a vehicle that is so heavily reliant on improvements through software updates. 7. Image Perception The Tesla Model 3 has a CEO problem. Right now, the image of the Tesla Model 3 is one of danger, as Elon Musk has taken a polarizing position in the Trump Administration. Regardless of your feelings on the administration, there are frequent protests at Tesla dealerships due to Elon Musk being largely behind government job cuts. Can’t Ignore Politics Elon Musk has become increasingly controversial. There should never be a time when politics dictates which vehicle someone drives, but it’s hard to ignore what’s happening in the world. As a result, some people will resist buying a Tesla Model 3 as a form of protest over its CEO&#8217;s controversial public persona. Right or wrong, this is a reason people are not purchasing or selling their existing Model 3 vehicles. 6. Autopilot Cost Full Self Driving works, but isn&#8217;t as good as promised. Tesla and Elon Musk, in particular, have heavily touted using the Autopilot functionality as the Tesla Model 3’s most significant selling point. While this is true for most Tesla models, there are some instances in which Full Self Driving has led to accidents that should give you room to pause. Not Ready Yet The hope is that self-driving will work better in the future. Yes, you can use full self-driving, and, if you want it forever, you need to pay upward of $8,000 or more. This is a crazy high price for a feature that doesn’t come close to delivering on what was initially promised. You can’t let any car drive itself without significant concerns about harming others or other vehicles. 5. Minimalist Interior The Model 3 remains very sparse without buttons. There is no question that the increase in electric car popularity has caused vehicle manufacturers to consider minimizing the number of buttons inside a vehicle&#8217;s interior. Tesla took it to the extreme by limiting the number of buttons to as few as possible. While some buttons are on the steering wheel, most everything happens through the infotainment screen. No More Buttons The Model 3 has almost zero buttons besides the steering wheel. What’s annoying about this is that nearly every critical operation of the Tesla Model 3 takes place on the touchscreen. You must quickly glance at the screen for most operations, which means taking your hands off the wheel. This is opposed to being able to adjust climate control or vehicle sound without leaving the wheel. 4. Range Worries There are concerns with Tesla&#8217;s range. The overall range is one of the biggest reasons I worry about buying a vehicle like the Tesla Model 3. When you factor in how easy it is to gas up a car while on a road trip, you know you can get gas and return in minutes. Unfortunately, unless you buy a Model 3 strictly for driving around town, you must factor in range and charging. Long Charging Times Charging a Tesla can take some time, even with a Supercharger. Yes, you can recharge fairly quickly at a Tesla Supercharger station, but you have to be able to not only find a Supercharger station, but as these stations are still too few and far between, you have to get in line. Given that charging a vehicle can take 20-30 minutes, plus the time you might need to wait to access a charge, range worries are not something to ignore. 3. Cold Weather Performance Model 3&#8217;s lose range in the winter months. If you’re looking to buy an electric vehicle, the Tesla Model 3 will undoubtedly raise questions about how much range it will lose in colder weather. While reports vary, seeing a range drop by 20-30% in frigid weather isn’t something to ignore. Why This Matters Driving a Tesla in cold weather has tradeoffs. If you live in a warm-weather area like Florida or Southern California, you don’t have to worry about too much of a range impact based on cold weather. However, if you live anywhere in the Northern United States, this is a cold-weather staple, and range loss during the winter months may affect your plan, including how frequently you need to charge. 2. Costly Repairs Teslas have costly repairs. Should the time come when your Tesla Model 3 needs to be repaired, whether because of build quality concerns or some other repair need, you should expect high repair costs. Given the complex design of the Model 3, electric vehicles in general, and Tesla’s proprietary parts, sometimes you can see repair costs upward of 20% more than comparable vehicles. Why This Matters Tesla locations are only found in heavily populated areas. Nobody likes surprise expenses, and vehicle repairs can be among the most surprising and the biggest headaches. In other words, between Tesla’s still somewhat sparse repair network and repairs that can take longer than other dealerships, it’s a real pain in the you know what. 1. Build Quality Concerns Build concerns have plagued Tesla for years. Among the biggest reasons, if not the most important, to avoid the Tesla Model 3 is questionable build quality. This has been plaguing Tesla for years, and the company has not been able to address it in a way that has restored confidence in the Model. Why This Matters Tesla&#8217;s build concerns are still present, even years after launch. Build quality matters a great deal when you are spending thousands of dollars on a vehicle. There is a definite reason to skip the Model 3, between thinning paint and misaligned panels. Perhaps worst of all, there is a genuine concern over resale value for those who have purchased the Model 3.

Much of the tariff damage will unfold in the summer months as lower-priced inventories dwindle at businesses. The firm says consumers are between a rock and a hard place as tariff-related costs trickle down to them, a situation exacerbated by higher shipping costs.
