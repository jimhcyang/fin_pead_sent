    "text": "After soaring in 2023 and 2024, shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) were battered throughout Q1 2025. And while the stock performed marginally better in Q2, the largest U.S. EV-maker slid into Q3. Over the past five days, the stock is down more than 8%, bringing its year-to-date loss to 22.50%. Since hitting its all-time high on Dec. 17, TSLA has fallen nearly 39%. Shareholders are hoping that the launch of Tesla&#8217;s Robotaxi can help the stock, which has seen increased volatility in the wake of abysmal Q1 earnings. Over the past decade, Tesla has suffered incredible losses that have shocked investors who had grown accustomed to the stock&#8217;s rapid appreciation over the past decade. The company&#8217;s meteoric rise has practically minted millionaires who jumped on the Musk bandwagon in the early goings. That&#8217;s certainly a move that&#8217;s come with some baggage and volatility along the way. But overall, it&#8217;s clear that Musk&#8217;s visionary status has rewarded shareholders since Tesla&#8217;s IPO on June 29, 2010. In early July, Goldman Sachs raised its price target on TSLA to $315 from $285, but maintained a &#8220;Neutral&#8221; rating after Tesla reported preliminary Q2 vehicle deliveries of about 384,000, which was down 13% year-over-year. Also in July, Mizuho lowered its price target on Tesla to $375 from $390 citing weakness in North America EV sales and Tesla&#8217;s headwinds in Europe. In late June, Benchmark analyst Mickey Legg raised the firm&#8217;s price target on Tesla to $475 from $350, maintaining its &#8220;Buy&#8221; following the successful launch of Robotaxi. The firm believes the rollout demonstrates &#8220;a controlled and safety-first approach,&#8221; according to the analyst, who argues that winning over regulators and public opinion is &#8220;paramount and will allow a rapid scale up if achieved.&#8221; The continues to see sales decline in the U.S. and abroad, and investors are hoping that the 90-day tariff pause between the U.S. and China sparks market optimism, affording shares of TSLA the opportunity to recover from has been a difficult 2025. Also in early June, Guggenheim said the company&#8217;s fundamentals &#8220;continue to deteriorate at an alarming rate,&#8221; with &#8220;soft&#8221; Q2 delivery trends. Guggenheim reiterates a &#8220;Sell&#8221; rating on the shares with a $175 price target. With Musk&#8217;s departure from DOGE, 24/7 Wall St. conducted analysis to provide more clarity. Let&#8217;s dive into whether the recent drop in Tesla’s stock price can be expected to continue, or if this is a top growth name that can rebound to new all-time highs and resume its march higher. Key Points Tesla deliverables are down year-over-year, and it continues facing headwinds in the U.S. and European markets. As CEO Elon Musk’s feud with President Trump continues, the stock has seen heightened volatility.

Key Drivers of Tesla&#8217;s Stock Performance 1. Core EV Business: Tesla&#8217;s most important business line is unsurprisingly the company&#8217;s auto business. With sales of the company&#8217;s EVs down on a year-over-year basis, and margins also declining from historically high levels following the onset of the pandemic, investors will continue to assess the company&#8217;s future prospects in proportion to how the company&#8217;s core revenue and earnings driver is performing. 2. Autonomous Driving (FSD), Robotics and More: Tesla&#8217;s value can be ascribed to what many long-term investors view as a call option on some other key growth categories CEO Elon Musk continues to work on. Aside from the company&#8217;s core electric vehicle offering, Tesla&#8217;s energy business, its FSD platform, humanoid robotics endeavors, AI verticals, and other growth categories make this stock unique in terms of the breadth and number of potential catalysts investors can look to for future growth. Of course, the extent to which these endeavors deliver boosted margins (or increased CapEx) remains to be seen. 3. Macro and Political Environment: Like it or not, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has cozied up to president Trump in a big way. This move is one that&#8217;s been broadly cheered by the overall market, at least out of the gate. Tesla stock soared following Donald Trump&#8217;s election victory, though Tesla has since given up its gains since this pivotal event, and has trended lower for seven straight weeks following the election. We&#8217;ll have to see if the Trump administration brings forward the sort of regulatory environment so many investors had hoped for in 2025 and in the years to come. What Wall Street Thinks Tesla’s stock price outlook for 2025 varies widely among analysts, reflecting uncertainties in production, market conditions, and EV advancements. Analyst price targets span a very wide range, with the most bearish analyst putting forward a $19.05 price target, and the most bullish suggesting this stock could head to $500 per share. Thus, there&#8217;s not really a true idea of where this stock is headed. And when investors think about the fact that many of these analyst projections are outdated, doing the math on where this stock could be headed over the course of the next year isn&#8217;t as easy as it seems. It&#8217;s worth noting that analysts remain largely bullish on the stock, though. However, given how far Tesla has fallen from its peak, even if the company can hit this target over the next year, it&#8217;ll still have a ways to go to make it to a new all-time high. The thing about Tesla and other high-growth stocks is that I find analysts are often chasing the returns these stocks provide. Thus, I think it&#8217;s best for most investors to steer clear of using analyst price targets as anything other than guardrails. Indeed, Tesla is one company I think is worth doing one&#8217;s own DCF analysis on and coming to one&#8217;s own price target. Tesla&#8217;s 2025 Outlook As we move through 2025, analyst opinions on where Tesla could be headed do vary. Overall, Tesla’s stock performance in 2025 is expected to be shaped by production output, market trends and advancements in EV and battery technology. Analysts project a 17.5% revenue increase to $117.2 billion, driven by growing demand and energy sector expansion. Tesla’s 2025 deliveries are forecasted at 1.95 million units by Barclays, below Bloomberg’s consensus of 2.08 million and Tesla’s earlier estimates. Despite a 62.5% stock surge in 2024, an $80 billion market value drop raised concerns. Musk remains optimistic, expecting a 20-30% delivery increase, though management later emphasized a &#8220;return to growth.&#8221; To add, competition from Waymo and declining registrations in Germany, France and California present challenges. Tesla’s push into AI and autonomous driving, including plans for a Robotaxi launch, could be a game-changer, but the company recently saw its share of the EV market slip below 50% in California. To compound matters, the stock is losing favorability among the smart money. Institutional holdings for TSLA are down t0 48.74%. Tesla Stock 2025 Price Target Based on Wall Street analysts&#8217; estimates, the median one-year price target for shares of TSLA is $294, which implies 0.03% potential upside from its current price. Of the 35 analysts covering Tesla, the stock currently receives a consensus “Hold” rating, with 13 analysts rating it a &#8220;Buy,&#8221; 13 rating it a &#8220;Hold&#8221; and nine rating it a &#8220;Sell.&#8221; On the other hand, 24/7 Wall St.&#8216;s 12-month price target for Tesla is bullish at $352.99, which represents potential upside of 20.10% from the current share price. Those figures are based on the company seeing projected revenue growth climb from $112.091 billion in 2025 to $297.430 billion in 2030, alongside normalized EPS growth of $2.85 in 2025 to $11.61 in 2030.

    "text": "SAN DIEGO, CA — A SIG Alert was ordered for a section of the northbound Interstate 15 Freeway in San Diego, and would last until Wednesday afternoon, California Highway Patrol advised. Shortly after 8:15 a.m., a 911 caller reported something was \"covering the #3 and #4 lanes of the northbound 15 Freeway and along the Friars Road offramp, according to CHP dispatch. As of 9:30 a.m., Cal Trans and Hazardous Materials teams arrived to clean up the mess, which was initially described as a cement spill and was later identified as a \"grease wastewater mixture classified as a hazardous material.\" The estimated cleanup time is approximately three hours, according to the CHP. The spill stemmed from a crash between a blue Tesla and a commercial concrete truck on the northbound I-15 near the Friars Road offramp, according to CHP dispatch. The closure affected drivers seeking alternate routes, increasing traffic on the 805 Freeway, as well as backing up travelers on the westbound 8 Freeway. Lane closures on the 15 northbound at Friars Road were expected to last until 2 p.m., CHP advised.",

Coinbase Deal 10:12 am by Gerelyn Terzo Digital asset exchange Coinbase (Nasdaq: COIN) has partnered with AI giant Perplexity AI in a deal that is reportedly designed to &#8220;to help traders get access to real-time trusted crypto data/info for better decision making.&#8221; Coinbase stock is trading lower by 0.60%. Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) will hold its annual shareholder meeting in early November. TSLA stock is gaining 2.4% but remains down 24.8% year-to-date. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets are meandering in and out of positive territory after the Nasdaq Composite clinched a fresh all-time high in yesterday&#8217;s session. As of early morning trading, the three major stock market indices are relatively flat. The Trump administration isn&#8217;t done slapping tariffs on trade partners, the most recent of which involves a 50% tariff on Brazilian imports. On the economic front, U.S. jobless claims moved lower last week, surprising economists amid mixed signals from the labor market. HSBC analysts have their eye on Advanced Micro Devices (Nasdaq: AMD), saying its recent AI chip solution has thrust it into the AI spotlight, potentially giving AI Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) a run for its money. HSBC has attached a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on AMD shares with a bullish price target of $200 per share, reflecting upside potential of approximately 44%. Yesterday, Nvidia made history by becoming the first company to cross the $4 trillion market cap threshold. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 21.94 (+0.05%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 54.91 (-0.27%) S&amp;P 500: Down 5.52 (0.09%) Market Movers MP Materials (NYSE: MP) stock is soaring 55% after the company inked a rare Earth-mining contract with the Department of Defense to strengthen the U.S. magnet supply. The deal is reportedly worth billions of dollars, including a $400 million capital injection by the DoD for preferred shares and a warrant, making the government agency a major shareholder of MP Materials. The Trump administration previously tipped its hand to deals like this as the U.S. goes head-to-head with China. Delta Airlines (NYSE: DAL) stock is soaring 12% today on strong quarterly results amid &#8220;stabilizing&#8221; travel demand. The airline managed to beat expectations in H1 2025 and increase its quarterly dividend payout by 25%, beginning in September. WK Kellogg (NYSE: KLG) is skyrocketing by 30% today after agreeing to be taken over by Italy&#8217;s Ferrero, which is behind the popular Nutella product, in a blockbuster $3.1 billion merger.

    "text": "The Mustang Mach-E, which is one of Ford’s flagship EVs, has an odd brand origin. It is an EV crossover, named after an iconic gas powered sports car which was launched in 1964. Sales blew through Ford’s (NYSE: F) expectation; Over 400,000 Mustangs were sold that first year. The gas powered Mustang is back. It outsold the Mach-E in the second quarter. According to Carscoops, Ford sold 10,178 Mach-Es between April and June. That is down 19.5% from the same period last year. Gas powered Mustang sales were 14,175, up 3.2% based on the same yardstick. Obviously, Mustang sales are not what they were. However, Mach-E sales are not what they are supposed to be. In 2021, Ford said it would invest $30 billion in EV development. In 2022, Ford said its annual production run rate for EVs would be 600,000. The company has never come close. Total EV sales in the second quarter were 16,428 down 31.4%. Sales of Ford’s other EV flagship, the F-150 Lightning, were 5,842 for the second quarter, down 26.1%. The Mustang news is yet another demonstration about Ford’s dismal EV sales. Ford’s US EV market share was just over 7% in February. Despite all its trouble’s Tesla’s was 45.2%. Ford has a long way to go before it can challenge Tesla. If Tesla can turn around sales, or even stop the fall off, Ford may not catch it at all. Mustang is an ancient brand, Ford celebrates its 60th anniversary on April 17. Ford’s announcement said It’s synonymous with fun, freedom, performance and a touch of rebellion – and fans around the world are today celebrating as the iconic Ford Mustang turns 60.” The Mach-E may never see its 60th birthday.

In each case, the reason is because of the change in the value of the two public companies they run. Key Points Larry Ellison&#8217;s Wealth Has Surged Oracle Has Become AI Company Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) Musk’s drop has been widely chronicled. The CEO of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has watched unit sales drop by over 10% in the second quarter. The figure is worse across most of Europe.

(sponsored) While there may be other factors, Elon Musk’s net worth recently rose $3 billion to $349 billion. This still leaves him down $83 billion since the start of 2025. The drop in Tesla’s (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock has not been enough to offset the SpaceX advance. Tesla’s shares are down 29% this year. Its market cap has fallen to $959 billion. Musk owns 14% of the company. Tesla has been damaged by a falloff in sales which are down over 10% this year. The figures are worse in Europe. Tesla has growing competition in China from local EV companies. Tesla’s self-driving feature is being tested in Austin. The results are inconclusive. Tesla has well funded competitors which include Google’s Waymo. The value of Tesla is based, to some extent, on these self-driving cars and its AI capabilities. Musk owns several other companies. Another of his largest holdings is xAI, the special media and AI business. Its value has moved up because AI investments have been so hot. It may be the biggest chance for his net worth to recover. SpaceX has a near monopoly on the rocket business. This has become more critical as more satellites and people have been launched into space. It has also built a huge network of satellites which allow it to offer broadband signals anywhere in the world. It has about 7,500 of these in orbit.

    "text": "Elon Musk can almost stop worrying about the value of Tesla’s (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock. His net worth has started to be concentrated in two massive private companies. One is SpaceX, the largest rocket company in the world. The other is xAI, which is the odd combination of his social media business and his AI operations. Key Points Elon Musk Has A Net Worth Based In Part On Private Companies The Value Of Tesla Is Less Important Than These Private Holdings. Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) Because of faltering sales and a troubling personal image which has alienated some buyers, Tesla’s stock has fallen from an all time high of $436 in early December of last year to $315. The stock is still up 204% in the last few years while the S&amp;P 500 is 96% higher. Many analysts believe the stock price cannot run back up to $400 or more until Musk proves that Tesla is the world’s clear leader in truly self-driving cars. Tesla has competition from Alphabet&#8217;s (NASDAQ: GOOG) Waymo and several Chinese auto manufacturers. In the meantime, Tesla’s vehicle unit sales have fallen for more than a year. SpaceX has two reasons for a tremendous valuation: the $400 billion figure is based on a current round of financing. This figure is up from $350 billion in December. SpaceX remains the premier provider of rockets that sling people and satellites into space. He has also used his rockets to build a satellite based broadband network that will soon be able to be accessed from everywhere in the world. It has 7,600 of these small orbiting devices, on the way to what the company says will be over 30,000. Musk owns 42% of SpaceX and 79% of the voting shares. On paper, that means his piece is worth $168 billion. xAI is a merger Musk engineered between his social media company X (formerly Twitter) which he bought in April 2022 and his AI operation, xAI. He paid $44 billion for Twitter. However, advertisers started to pull away from using the platform and the value collapsed. In the new merger, X was valued at $33 billion (the equity value less the debt). People questioned why struggling X had a valuation of nearly that. Because of his ownership stakes in the two companies, he was able to push the transaction through. Musk’s AI operation competes with OpenAI among others. (OpenAI is valued at $300 billion.) According to the FT, Musk is about to close a round of financing that will value xAI as $80 billion. The paper also reports &#8220;Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, PIF, is expected to play a large role in the deal.&#8221; The AI portion of the company produces the Grok chatbot which recently produced a number of antisemitic results That does not seem to have dented the new financing. Musk owns 59% of the new AI plus social median company. That puts the value of his piece at $47 billion. Musk’s investments in SpaceX and xAI are worth $215 billion when added together. (Bloomberg puts his entire net worth at $360 billion.) The post Musk&#8217;s SpaceX Is Worth $400 Billion, xAI Worth $200 Billion appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",

    "text": "Shares of Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) momentarily stopped the bleeding over the past five trading sessions, clawing back with 6.74% gain. But the stock remains down more than 261% from its year-to-date high on Feb. 15. This most recent slide can be partially attributed to CEO Elon Musk&#8217;s ongoing, public feud with President Trump, which the market has reacted negatively to. In June and July, the EV firm has experienced a series of price target revisions from analysts. Goldman Sachs raised its price target on TSLA to $315 from $285 while maintaining a &#8220;Neutral&#8221; rating. Benchmark raised its price target on TSLA to $475 from $350 while maintaining a &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating following the successful launch of Tesla&#8217;s robotaxi business in Austin. UBS raised its price target on TSLA to $215 from $190 but maintained its &#8220;Sell&#8221; rating. Mizuho lowered its price target on TSLA to $375 from $390 while maintaining its &#8220;Outperform&#8221; rating. Indeed, Tesla&#8217;s stock has gone through vicious crashes before. And while the stock may not be ready to shift gears from reverse to forward, I do think that a worsening of its latest drawdown could prove a significant buying opportunity, given the chance its drivers could pay off at some point over the medium term. Undoubtedly, the bears may be winning the tug-of-war on the stock now, as Elon Musk&#8217;s role at DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) becomes old news as hype surrounding Musk&#8217;s friendship with Trump begins to fade. However, with EV competition mounting and a Jeff Bezos-backed startup entering the scene, Tesla&#8217;s outlook remains clouded. In any case, 24/7 Wall St. dove into the lengthy list of drivers and potholes that investors should look forward to (or fasten their seatbelts for) in the coming year and beyond. Let&#8217;s check out a bull, bear, and base case for the EV titan and have a glimpse at the varied viewpoints of multiple Wall Street pros. In fact, Tesla stock has a ton of table-pounding bulls in addition to massive bears. While not everyone is the biggest fan of Elon Musk, I do think it&#8217;s a mistake to discount his ability to keep running with the ball into the endzone with disruptive innovations that, while costly in the near term, could prove revolutionary over the longer term. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: Tesla remains the leader of the EV revolution, dominating global market share despite the stock’s recent struggles. The company faces numerous headwinds, which could ultimately impact its long-term performance. If you’re looking for a megatrend with massive potential, make sure to grab a complimentary copy of our “The Next NVIDIA” report. The report includes a complete industry map of AI investments that includes many small caps. Tesla&#8217;s Top Two Growth Drivers Are Still Humming Along For a stock that&#8217;s fallen significantly, I&#8217;d expect the growth narrative to have been severely impacted. Tesla&#8217;s latest quarterly earnings results were not incredible. Yet, I do think that the sell-off is mostly a mere correction to make up for the euphoric melt-up experienced in the back half of last year. Indeed, investors got too far ahead of themselves when it came to Tesla&#8217;s most ambitious growth drivers. Now that investors are taking a step back, we&#8217;ll have to wait and see if Tesla can advance such drivers meaningfully. Undoubtedly, Tesla has a front-row seat to the AI revolution. More specifically, it&#8217;s one of the frontrunners in physical AI (or robotics, if you prefer). In a prior piece, I highlighted Wall Street analyst Adam Jonas&#8217; view that TSLA stock was akin to an embodied &#8220;AI ETF&#8221; given the numerous AI projects going on behind the scenes. Though Tesla&#8217;s AI efforts are exciting, it&#8217;s important to note that being too soon to a trend could have a drastic negative impact on the stock. As investors reset expectations and become more critical of how firms spend money on AI, Tesla will need to deliver more substance if it&#8217;s to convince investors to punch their ticket to the stock well ahead of time. Personally, I think Tesla&#8217;s been investing in the right areas, but will competitors beat Tesla to market in certain categories? The most notable drivers, I believe, that will drive Tesla stock in the coming years are the Cybertruck (as well as self-driving capabilities and the impact on the robotaxi market) and its Optimus robot. Of course, there&#8217;s also the rumored &#8220;Model Q&#8221; entry-level offering. But until we get more clarity on that driver, I consider it to be more of a &#8220;wild card.&#8221; Bull Case for Tesla&#8217;s Share Price Cybertruck: The Cybertruck stole the show during Tesla&#8217;s robotaxi event. While it would be a sci-fi dream for many to have a fairly reasonably priced robotaxi producing passive income for its owners, I do think Musk&#8217;s vision of the robotaxi future could be a reality within Trump&#8217;s term. Of course, a more realistic timeframe would put such a future more than 10 years out. However, if Tesla can floor it on full self-driving (FSD) efforts, perhaps such a future could be closer to the present. There&#8217;s a great deal of uncertainty with FSD, given the technical and regulatory unknowns. Either way, I view Musk&#8217;s friendship with Trump as a boon for a Cybertruck rollout under his administration. If Cybertruck expands its presence and becomes a hit within years rather than decades, TSLA stock could prove a bargain, given all that there is to gain. The big question, though, is how Cybercab will hold its own as Waymo pushes ahead with its impressive offering. Given robotaxis, like generative AI, are unlikely to be a &#8220;winner takes all&#8221; market, I think there&#8217;s no reason why both robotaxi offerings can&#8217;t win big from prime-time adoption of self-driving. Another big question to consider is whether consumers will be interested in buying up Cybercabs to have them rolling around on the streets as ride-hailers. I think the business could prove quite lucrative for buyers and Tesla&#8217;s margins over the long haul. After all, it can sell the car and continue to build a ride-hailing network while profiting from use of a ride-hailing app of sorts. Cathie Wood thinks autonomous ride-hailing could represent a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity. If Tesla can get a nice slice, Wood sees TSLA stock at $2,600 per share by 2029. Personally, I think the bull case (for the year ahead) could see TSLA at around $550 per share — or 86.35% higher than where the stock is trading today. That target is shared by Wedbush Securities&#8217; Dan Ives, one of my favorite analysts in tech. Optimus: Optimus was a nice addition to the robotaxis event as it amused attendees. But the big question is how much potential the robot has once it&#8217;s ready to go on sale to the general public. Undoubtedly, Tesla isn&#8217;t the only one getting into the robotics game. Many Mag Seven members also investing heavily in home robots. While more rivals in home robots could be a threat to Optimus, I view it as more of a confirmation that there is a place in the home for such profound innovations. As for the home robotics market, I do see 2026 as a tad overly optimistic for a launch. However, if robot &#8220;friends&#8221; do arrive by 2030, I think Tesla&#8217;s growth rate could reaccelerate back to or even above 25% to 30% for some amount of time. Bear Case for Tesla&#8217;s Share Price Cybertruck: Undoubtedly, there&#8217;s still a lot of work to do before Cybertruck makes an impact on the car market. FSD capabilities need to step things up and the vehicle needs to be made in a way that won&#8217;t break the bank. These are big asks. Some bears have doubts about whether the firm can execute the opportunity. In late March, the company announced that it was recalling nearly every Cybertruck due to a potential crash risk. This was an enormous blow to Musk&#8217;s ambitions for the EV, which has already been subjected to harsh criticism about its perceived shortcomings among owners. Analysts&#8217; Downgrades &amp; Lower Price Targets: Ross Gerber, who previously owned shares, has sold out with the view a 50% crash would be in store for 2025. He also thinks FSD &#8220;doesn&#8217;t work.&#8221; If true, that&#8217;s a gut punch to Tesla&#8217;s biggest growth driver. Either way, there&#8217;s not too much room lower with TSLA now off 40%. At the start of Q2, Goldman Sachs&#8217; price target on Tesla was lowered to $260 from $275 while maintaining a neutral rating. The firm reduced its auto industry outlook and estimates, saying it will be difficult for the auto industry to fully pass on tariff costs, especially given softening consumer demand. Nonetheless, Goldman Sachs&#8217; one-year price target represents downside potential of 11.90% from today&#8217;s price. In June, Guggenheim said Tesla&#8217;s fundamentals &#8220;continue to deteriorate at an alarming rate,&#8221; with &#8220;soft&#8221; Q2 delivery trends confirming demand for the refreshed Model Y has not helped Tesla&#8217;s sales momentum. Guggenheim expects &#8220;sizable&#8221; negative revisions to Q2 delivery estimates. The firm&#8217;s 360,000 estimate is well below the consensus of 415,000. The firm reiterates its &#8220;Sell&#8221; rating on the shares with a $175 price target. Bad Press: Musk&#8217;s deteriorated image at the hands of his federal government involvement with DOGE aside, Tesla has continued to bear the brunt of bad news. In late 2024, it was widely reported that the EV maker was the most dangerous vehicle brand, with the number of deaths among all automakers, according to the Insurance Institute of Highway Safety. According to the study, Tesla has a fatal accident rate of 5.6 per billion vehicle miles, compared to the overall average of just 2.8. Additionally, ongoing protests against the brand — including vandalism and arson — have occurred around the globe, from Italy and France to numerous states in the U.S. Optimus: Even if home robots are on the horizon, good luck asking consumers to spend thousands on a proven technology. Indeed, if Vision Pro taught us anything, it&#8217;s that being an early adopter is expensive and probably not the best use of funds. Either way, I&#8217;d much rather wait and see how the robot ambitions pan out before getting too excited at this stage. Insider &amp; Institutional Activity: There&#8217;s an old adage on Wall Street that suggests investors should &#8220;follow the money.&#8221; If that&#8217;s the current case for Tesla, money is flowing out. In fact, over the past 12 years, no one single share of TSLA has been purchased by insiders (e.g., the company&#8217;s executives, directors or anyone who owns 10% or more of the company), according to Nasdaq.com. Data from Finviz supports this, even showing that Musk himself, as well as his brother, have been offloading shares since late 2024. Additionally, institutional ownership has now decreased to just 48.79%. In total, 447 institutional investors have entirely liquidated their Tesla positions, with 1,850 institutional holders having decreased their positions versus 2,020 having increased them. Increased competition: Also in April, a Jeff Bezos-backed EV company called Slate unveiled affordable EV truck and SUV models that cost $20,000 after federal incentives. The company has billed itself as the &#8220;anti-Tesla,&#8221; and is made in the U.S. As Tesla&#8217;s market share has fallen under 50% in EV-friendly California, the arrival of Slate could continue to erode sales. Base Case for Tesla&#8217;s Share Price The base case for Tesla lies somewhere in between the two extremes. Wall Street analysts have assigned TSLA a median one-year price target of $293.38, or 7.41% potential downside from today&#8217;s price. Meanwhile, the high-end target is $500 and the low-end target is $19.05. I&#8217;m inclined to view the $300 level as a fair-value level for the stock. Much of Tesla&#8217;s story depends on its big growth drivers. In the meantime, EV sales and the rise of more affordable models (Model Q) could be nearer-term stories to look forward to as one waits for the biggest of drivers to pay off. At the time of writing, TSLA stock goes for 161.29 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E) and 10.15 times froward price-to-sales (P/S). That makes the name slightly undervalued, at least in my view.

    "text": "After soaring in 2023 and 2024, shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) were battered throughout Q1 2025. And while the stock performed marginally better in Q2, the largest U.S. EV-maker slid into Q3. However, over the past five days, the stock is up 6.56%, trimming its year-to-date loss to 16.44%. But since hitting its all-time high on Dec. 17, TSLA has fallen nearly 34%. Shareholders are hoping that the launch of Tesla&#8217;s Robotaxi can help the stock, which has seen increased volatility in the wake of abysmal Q1 earnings and an ongoing spat with the Trump administration. Over the past decade, Tesla has suffered incredible losses that have shocked investors who had grown accustomed to the stock&#8217;s rapid appreciation over the past decade. The company&#8217;s meteoric rise has practically minted millionaires who jumped on the Musk bandwagon in the early goings. That&#8217;s certainly a move that&#8217;s come with some baggage and volatility along the way. But overall, it&#8217;s clear that Musk&#8217;s visionary status has rewarded shareholders since Tesla&#8217;s IPO on June 29, 2010. In early July, Goldman Sachs raised its price target on TSLA to $315 from $285, but maintained a &#8220;Neutral&#8221; rating after Tesla reported preliminary Q2 vehicle deliveries of about 384,000, which was down 13% year-over-year. Also in July, Mizuho lowered its price target on Tesla to $375 from $390 citing weakness in North America EV sales and Tesla&#8217;s headwinds in Europe. In late June, Benchmark analyst Mickey Legg raised the firm&#8217;s price target on Tesla to $475 from $350, maintaining its &#8220;Buy&#8221; following the successful launch of Robotaxi. The firm believes the rollout demonstrates &#8220;a controlled and safety-first approach,&#8221; according to the analyst, who argues that winning over regulators and public opinion is &#8220;paramount and will allow a rapid scale up if achieved.&#8221; The company continues to see sales decline in the U.S. and abroad, resulting in a series of downgrades. Also in early June, Guggenheim said the company&#8217;s fundamentals &#8220;continue to deteriorate at an alarming rate,&#8221; with &#8220;soft&#8221; Q2 delivery trends. Guggenheim reiterates a &#8220;Sell&#8221; rating on the shares with a $175 price target. 24/7 Wall St. conducted analysis to provide more clarity. Let&#8217;s dive into whether the recent drop in Tesla’s stock price can be expected to continue, or if this is a top growth name that can rebound to new all-time highs and resume its march higher. Key Points Tesla deliverables are down year-over-year, and it continues facing headwinds in the U.S. and European markets. As CEO Elon Musk’s feud with President Trump continues, the stock has seen heightened volatility.

Key Drivers of Tesla&#8217;s Stock Performance 1. Core EV Business: Tesla&#8217;s most important business line is unsurprisingly the company&#8217;s auto business. With sales of the company&#8217;s EVs down on a year-over-year basis, and margins also declining from historically high levels following the onset of the pandemic, investors will continue to assess the company&#8217;s future prospects in proportion to how the company&#8217;s core revenue and earnings driver is performing. 2. Autonomous Driving (FSD), Robotics and More: Tesla&#8217;s value can be ascribed to what many long-term investors view as a call option on some other key growth categories CEO Elon Musk continues to work on. Aside from the company&#8217;s core electric vehicle offering, Tesla&#8217;s energy business, its FSD platform, humanoid robotics endeavors, AI verticals, and other growth categories make this stock unique in terms of the breadth and number of potential catalysts investors can look to for future growth. Of course, the extent to which these endeavors deliver boosted margins (or increased CapEx) remains to be seen. 3. Macro and Political Environment: Like it or not, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has cozied up to president Trump in a big way. This move is one that&#8217;s been broadly cheered by the overall market, at least out of the gate. Tesla stock soared following Donald Trump&#8217;s election victory, though Tesla has since given up its gains since this pivotal event, and has trended lower for seven straight weeks following the election. We&#8217;ll have to see if the Trump administration brings forward the sort of regulatory environment so many investors had hoped for in 2025 and in the years to come. What Wall Street Thinks Tesla’s stock price outlook for 2025 varies widely among analysts, reflecting uncertainties in production, market conditions, and EV advancements. Analyst price targets span a very wide range, with the most bearish analyst putting forward a $19.05 price target, and the most bullish suggesting this stock could head to $500 per share. Thus, there&#8217;s not really a true idea of where this stock is headed. And when investors think about the fact that many of these analyst projections are outdated, doing the math on where this stock could be headed over the course of the next year isn&#8217;t as easy as it seems. It&#8217;s worth noting that analysts remain largely bullish on the stock, though. However, given how far Tesla has fallen from its peak, even if the company can hit this target over the next year, it&#8217;ll still have a ways to go to make it to a new all-time high. The thing about Tesla and other high-growth stocks is that I find analysts are often chasing the returns these stocks provide. Thus, I think it&#8217;s best for most investors to steer clear of using analyst price targets as anything other than guardrails. Indeed, Tesla is one company I think is worth doing one&#8217;s own DCF analysis on and coming to one&#8217;s own price target. Tesla&#8217;s 2025 Outlook As we move through 2025, analyst opinions on where Tesla could be headed do vary. Overall, Tesla’s stock performance in 2025 is expected to be shaped by production output, market trends and advancements in EV and battery technology. Analysts project a 17.5% revenue increase to $117.2 billion, driven by growing demand and energy sector expansion. Tesla’s 2025 deliveries are forecasted at 1.95 million units by Barclays, below Bloomberg’s consensus of 2.08 million and Tesla’s earlier estimates. Despite a 62.5% stock surge in 2024, an $80 billion market value drop raised concerns. Musk remains optimistic, expecting a 20-30% delivery increase, though management later emphasized a &#8220;return to growth.&#8221; To add, competition from Waymo and declining registrations in Germany, France and California present challenges. Tesla’s push into AI and autonomous driving, including plans for a Robotaxi launch, could be a game-changer, but the company recently saw its share of the EV market slip below 50% in California. To compound matters, the stock is losing favorability among the smart money. Institutional holdings for TSLA are down t0 48.74%. Tesla Stock 2025 Price Target Based on Wall Street analysts&#8217; estimates, the median one-year price target for shares of TSLA is $293.38, which implies 7.43% potential upside from its current price. Of the 35 analysts covering Tesla, the stock currently receives a consensus “Hold” rating, with 13 analysts rating it a &#8220;Buy,&#8221; 13 rating it a &#8220;Hold&#8221; and nine rating it a &#8220;Sell.&#8221; On the other hand, 24/7 Wall St.&#8216;s 12-month price target for Tesla is bullish at $352.99, which represents potential upside of 11.37% from the current share price. Those figures are based on the company seeing projected revenue growth climb from $112.091 billion in 2025 to $297.430 billion in 2030, alongside normalized EPS growth of $2.85 in 2025 to $11.61 in 2030.

    "text": "While the average price of a car sold in India is $13,000, Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) will sell its Model Y there for about $69,770, according to Reuters. India is the world’s fourth-largest car market. Its annual sales of 4.4 million light vehicles puts it behind China (25.1 million), the United States (15.4 million), and Japan (4.5 million). Clearly, Tesla is aiming at the highest-priced segment in the world’s second-largest nation by population. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) reportedly will sell its Model Y in India for nearly $70,000. It will compete with entrenched high-end brands there and face a charging station challenge. Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) One of Tesla’s major hurdles in India is tariffs of over 100%. If the Trump administration improves those tariff numbers, the price of the Model Y could drop considerably. It would still be expensive by local standards. Tesla aims to compete with high-end brands. These will be, at least, Mercedes and BMW. Since they are entrenched, it is hard to say how difficult it will be to dislodge them. And, they have gasoline-powered engines. Tesla also has to figure out the charging station challenge. Unlike the U.S., India will not have thousands of chargers. Tesla may start to manufacture cars in India. That will help its relationship with the national government, much as it has in China. However, that will not be enough to offset the high price and the need for a national infrastructure of charging stations.

    "text": "Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Trading Day Over 4:14 pm by Eric Bleeker At the end of the day, OpenDoor closed up 42.67%. That&#8217;s a mammoth gain for any trading day, yet I&#8217;d imagine plenty of investors were disappointed with the way it ended. Options traders had been making massive bets on OpenDoor to hit $4.50, so there appears to have been some major profit taking with shares trading comfortably above that level in late trading. OpenDoor from trading for $4.88 at 2:40 p.m. ET down to $2.94 at 3:35 p.m. ET. Yet, it is worth noting that shares rallied into the bell and are up another 6.5% after-hours as of 4:18 p.m. ET. One thing is for certain: tomorrow will be another wild ride. Trading resumes 3:17 pm After losing 30% plus in value after a mega trade triggered a pause on the stock, OPEN is back up to $3.95 per share and still up 70% on the day. OPEN stock trading halted 3:12 pm After soaring as high as 115% today OPEN just received a massive sell order that prompted a trading freeze on the stock. Around 3 PM EDT, a 35 million share trade order was received the stock was set to plummet. OpenDoor Now Past 100% Gains Today 1:57 pm by Eric Bleeker OpenDoor is now up 110% on the day. Volume stands at 1.2 billion shares traded, which is 12X more than OpenDoor&#8217;s usual level. We still have two more hours of trading left in the day. OpenDoor Mentions Skyrocketing on WallStreetBets 1:12 pm by Eric Bleeker Since we first published this live blog, mentions of OpenDoor have skyrocketed even higher on WallStreetBets. Third-party tracking site AltIndex now has 263 mentions of OpenDoor, which is higher than second place Tesla&#8217;s 232. Behind those stocks is Alphabet, Robinhood, NVIDIA, UnitedHealth, RocketLab, GameStop, and AST SpaceMobile. OpenDoor Surges To New Highs 1:11 pm by Eric Bleeker As of 1:11 p.m. ET, OpenDoor shares have hit $4.37 and are now up 94% on the day. OpenDoor Tests Daily High of $4.26 12:22 pm by Eric Bleeker OpenDoor reached its high today at 11:35 a.m. when shares hit $4.26. Shortly after that peak fell back to $3.69 at 11:55 a.m. ET. As of 12:22 p.m., the rally ahs resumed and OpenDoor is trading for about $4 per share. The broader market is having a strong day today with the Nasdaq up .65% and the S&amp;P 500 up .56%. Yet, one segment of the market is outperforming everything else: that&#8217;s the new meme stocks. We&#8217;ve come a long way from the rallies in stocks like Gamestop and AMC that dominated 2021, and a crop of new companies has captured retail investors&#8217; attention. The number one stock in focus right now: OpenDoor (Nasdaq: OPEN). OpenDoor&#8217;s rally began after Eric Jackson posted on X that he believed the stock could reach $82 per share. He said: &#8220;Over the last month, my X impressions have exploded talking about $BTQQF $IREN and $CIFR because everyone is looking for the next $CVNA. We think we just found another. @EMJCapital has taken a position in $OPEN — and we believe it could be a 100-bagger over the next few years.&#8221; The price target of $82 was essentially OpenDoor&#8217;s share price at the time, times 100. Very scientific, I know. Yet, Jackson calls himself &#8220;the Carvana hedge fund guy&#8221; and his cheerleading of OpenDoor has attracted plenty of attention. After Carvana&#8217;s 100-fold surge from the bottom, investors are rabdily looking for the next great turnaround story. This live blog will be watching activity in the momentum stocks today with a focus on which stocks are seeing the biggest movements. Momentum Stock Leaderboard Among stocks that have become retail favorites in the current market rally, here&#8217;s a look at some of today&#8217;s biggest movers: OpenDoor: Up 72% as of 12:05 p.m. ET. The company is now worth more than $2 billion. Shares are now up 144% year-to-date, yet many investors buying into the rally are surely lookign at the long-term chart and seeing OpenDoor hit $35 per share back in February 2021. There&#8217;s no specific news on the company today. However, third party data tracking WallStreetBets discussions have OpenDoor passing Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) as the most discussed stock in the past 24 hours. Navitas Semiconductor: Up 30% midday. The company opened the day trading for about $7.44 per share, but has since zoomed higher to $8.75. There doesn&#8217;t appear to be any news related to the company, but Navitas has been a popular stock since they announced a collaboration with NVIDIA on their 800-volt HVDC architecture. Momentum Stocks Dropping Today While OpenDoor and Navitas are surging, a few popualar momentum stocks are having tougher days. Lucid (Nasdaq: LCID) is down 8.8% while QuantumScape (NYSE: QS) is down 14%. If you&#8217;re looking for news on QuantumScape, good luck. It&#8217;s largely all AI-generated slop (womp womp). The reality is there doesn&#8217;t seem to material news. The stock is up 198% in the past month and it&#8217;s likely that some large investor (or investors) is taking profits today. The story is similar for Lucid, the stock has skyrocketed in recent weeks thanks to a partnership with Uber and investors are likely taking profits today rather than any material information impacting the company&#8217;s share price.

    "text": "After soaring in 2023 and 2024, shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) were battered throughout Q1 2025. And while the stock performed marginally better in Q2, the largest U.S. EV-maker slid into Q3. However, over the past five days, the stock is up 4.28%, trimming its year-to-date loss to 14.03%. But since hitting its all-time high on Dec. 17, TSLA has fallen nearly 32%. Shareholders are hoping that the launch of Tesla&#8217;s Robotaxi can help the stock, which has seen increased volatility in the wake of abysmal Q1 earnings and an ongoing spat with the Trump administration. Over the past decade, Tesla has suffered incredible losses that have shocked investors who had grown accustomed to the stock&#8217;s rapid appreciation over the past decade. The company&#8217;s meteoric rise has practically minted millionaires who jumped on the Musk bandwagon in the early goings. That&#8217;s certainly a move that&#8217;s come with some baggage and volatility along the way. But overall, it&#8217;s clear that Musk&#8217;s visionary status has rewarded shareholders since Tesla&#8217;s IPO on June 29, 2010. 24/7 Wall St. conducted analysis to provide more clarity. Let&#8217;s dive into whether the recent drop in Tesla’s stock price can be expected to continue, or if this is a top growth name that can rebound to new all-time highs and resume its march higher. Key Points Tesla deliverables are down year-over-year, and it continues facing headwinds in the U.S. and European markets. As CEO Elon Musk’s feud with President Trump continues, the stock has seen heightened volatility.

Key Drivers of Tesla&#8217;s Stock Performance 1. Core EV Business: Tesla&#8217;s most important business line is unsurprisingly the company&#8217;s auto business. With sales of the company&#8217;s EVs down on a year-over-year basis, and margins also declining from historically high levels following the onset of the pandemic, investors will continue to assess the company&#8217;s future prospects in proportion to how the company&#8217;s core revenue and earnings driver is performing. 2. Autonomous Driving (FSD), Robotics and More: Tesla&#8217;s value can be ascribed to what many long-term investors view as a call option on some other key growth categories CEO Elon Musk continues to work on. Aside from the company&#8217;s core electric vehicle offering, Tesla&#8217;s energy business, its FSD platform, humanoid robotics endeavors, AI verticals, and other growth categories make this stock unique in terms of the breadth and number of potential catalysts investors can look to for future growth. Of course, the extent to which these endeavors deliver boosted margins (or increased CapEx) remains to be seen. 3. Macro and Political Environment: Like it or not, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has cozied up to president Trump in a big way. This move is one that&#8217;s been broadly cheered by the overall market, at least out of the gate. Tesla stock soared following Donald Trump&#8217;s election victory, though Tesla has since given up its gains since this pivotal event, and has trended lower for seven straight weeks following the election. We&#8217;ll have to see if the Trump administration brings forward the sort of regulatory environment so many investors had hoped for in 2025 and in the years to come. What Wall Street Thinks Tesla’s stock price outlook for 2025 varies widely among analysts, reflecting uncertainties in production, market conditions, and EV advancements. Analyst price targets span a very wide range, with the most bearish analyst putting forward a $19.05 price target, and the most bullish suggesting this stock could head to $500 per share. Thus, there&#8217;s not really a true idea of where this stock is headed. And when investors think about the fact that many of these analyst projections are outdated, doing the math on where this stock could be headed over the course of the next year isn&#8217;t as easy as it seems. It&#8217;s worth noting that analysts remain largely bullish on the stock, though. However, given how far Tesla has fallen from its peak, even if the company can hit this target over the next year, it&#8217;ll still have a ways to go to make it to a new all-time high. The thing about Tesla and other high-growth stocks is that I find analysts are often chasing the returns these stocks provide. Thus, I think it&#8217;s best for most investors to steer clear of using analyst price targets as anything other than guardrails. Indeed, Tesla is one company I think is worth doing one&#8217;s own DCF analysis on and coming to one&#8217;s own price target. In early July, Goldman Sachs raised its price target on TSLA to $315 from $285, but maintained a &#8220;Neutral&#8221; rating after Tesla reported preliminary Q2 vehicle deliveries of about 384,000, which was down 13% year-over-year. Also in July, Mizuho lowered its price target on Tesla to $375 from $390 citing weakness in North America EV sales and Tesla&#8217;s headwinds in Europe. In late June, Benchmark analyst Mickey Legg raised the firm&#8217;s price target on Tesla to $475 from $350, maintaining its &#8220;Buy&#8221; following the successful launch of Robotaxi. The firm believes the rollout demonstrates &#8220;a controlled and safety-first approach,&#8221; according to the analyst, who argues that winning over regulators and public opinion is &#8220;paramount and will allow a rapid scale up if achieved.&#8221; The company continues to see sales decline in the U.S. and abroad, resulting in a series of downgrades. Also in early June, Guggenheim said the company&#8217;s fundamentals &#8220;continue to deteriorate at an alarming rate,&#8221; with &#8220;soft&#8221; Q2 delivery trends. Guggenheim reiterates a &#8220;Sell&#8221; rating on the shares with a $175 price target. Tesla&#8217;s 2025 Outlook As we move through 2025, analyst opinions on where Tesla could be headed do vary. Overall, Tesla’s stock performance in 2025 is expected to be shaped by production output, market trends and advancements in EV and battery technology. Analysts project a 17.5% revenue increase to $117.2 billion, driven by growing demand and energy sector expansion. Tesla’s 2025 deliveries are forecasted at 1.95 million units by Barclays, below Bloomberg’s consensus of 2.08 million and Tesla’s earlier estimates. Despite a 62.5% stock surge in 2024, an $80 billion market value drop raised concerns. Musk remains optimistic, expecting a 20-30% delivery increase, though management later emphasized a &#8220;return to growth.&#8221; To add, competition from Waymo and declining registrations in Germany, France and California present challenges. Tesla’s push into AI and autonomous driving, including plans for a Robotaxi launch, could be a game-changer, but the company recently saw its share of the EV market slip below 50% in California. To compound matters, the stock is losing favorability among the smart money. Institutional holdings for TSLA are down t0 48.74%. Tesla Stock 2025 Price Target Based on Wall Street analysts&#8217; estimates, the median one-year price target for shares of TSLA is $299.52, which implies 8.13% potential upside from its current price. Of the 34 analysts covering Tesla, the stock currently receives a consensus “Hold” rating, with 13 analysts rating it a &#8220;Buy,&#8221; 13 rating it a &#8220;Hold&#8221; and eight rating it a &#8220;Sell.&#8221; On the other hand, 24/7 Wall St.&#8216;s 12-month price target for Tesla is bullish at $352.99, which represents potential upside of 8.25% from the current share price. Those figures are based on the company seeing projected revenue growth climb from $112.091 billion in 2025 to $297.430 billion in 2030, alongside normalized EPS growth of $2.85 in 2025 to $11.61 in 2030.

SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) 2025 hasn’t been a smooth ride. The economy has seen volatility, the market has seen several ups and downs, and investors are scrambling to look for low-risk options to invest their money. There are concerns about the impact of tariffs, and consumer spending is low. Amidst the uncertainty, the only way to invest is to look for low-volatility investment options that can generate steady income. Exchange-traded funds have emerged as one of the top investment options this year. They allow investors to own a collection of stocks with just one investment and at a low cost. I was a die-hard fan of mutual funds, but the returns weren’t satisfactory, which is why I decided to make a switch to ETFs. With thousands of ETFs to choose from, it can become overwhelming, and the industry is getting more crowded. Here are the top 3 I invested in. SPDR Gold Shares Gold has always been considered a hedge against inflation, and the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) ETF is a top choice amid uncertain markets. Launched by State Street Global Advisors, the ETF is traded on exchanges in Hong Kong, Mexico, Japan, and Singapore. It is a trust that purchases, stores, and sells gold bullion, allowing investors to capitalize on rising gold prices. It has a low expense ratio of 0.40% and is the largest gold ETF in the market. Its NAV has soared over 40% in a year and about 12% in five years. The fund launched in 2004 and has kept pace with the S&amp;P 500 over the years. Gold prices will fluctuate in the short term, but the past year has seen a steady upside. Geopolitical tensions and the expanding money supply have lifted the commodity’s value. GLD is a defensive investment, and it brings stability to my portfolio. It is easier for me to pay the annual management fee as compared to buying and storing gold bullion. This ETF has become a centrepiece of my portfolio. Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index ETF A reliable dividend ETF by Vanguard, the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (NYSE: VYM) has a strong history of delivering steady income and capital appreciation. It has an expense ratio of 0.06% and it tracks the performance of FTSE High Dividend Yield Index. VYM has a yield of 2.57% and holds 582 stocks. The sector distribution includes: Financials: 21.50% Industrials: 13.40% Technology: 12.30% Healthcare: 12.10% It holds some of the biggest dividend paying companies in the top 10, including Walmart, AbbVie, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Exxon Mobil. The ETF pays quarterly dividends, and the strong portfolio allows it to remain consistent at it. VYM has generated double-digit annualized market returns with a return of 10.4% in 5 years and 12.4% in the past year. The fund is filled with large-cap stocks that have a stable balance sheet and a record of strong financial performance. Despite market volatility, the fund has remained resilient and outperformed the S&amp;P 500. It offers a safety net and steady dividend income. Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) I believe in the future of tech and wanted to make the most of the sector. Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) allows me to do that. It holds the Magnificent Seven and has a yield of 0.58%. The fund is known for its impressive capital appreciation. QQQ tracks the performance of the Nasdaq 100 index and has the 100 largest companies listed on the stock exchange. It aims for high growth while providing exposure to the best U.S. non-financial companies. It is a tech-focused ETF with over 50% allocation to tech stocks, followed by 19.66% in consumer staples and 5.80% in healthcare. It is top heavy with the 10 holdings making up 51% of the portfolio and these include the Magnificent Seven like Nvidia, Alphabet, Tesla, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Apple. Slightly on the expensive side, QQQ has an NAV of 530.82 and is up 16% in 12 months. The NAV has soared over 100% in the past five years, generating impressive gains for investors. As long as the tech sector continues to expand, QQQ is set to benefit. The post I Switched from Mutual Funds to These 3 ETFs—Here’s Why appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",

    "text": "New York State Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani's victory in the Democratic primary for the New York City mayoral race is the latest example of the rise of progressive socialist policies in Democrat-led cities. Mamdani is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) and has made socialist policies a cornerstone of his platform, from implementing a rent freeze on rent-controlled apartments to expanding city-owned grocery stores. He has also called for higher taxes on corporations in New York City and an extra 2% flat tax on the wealthiest 1% of New Yorkers, wants the minimum wage to rise to $30 an hour by 2030, said he'll permanently eliminate fares on all city buses and has pledged to \"implement free childcare for every New Yorker aged six weeks to five years.\" Another DSA-backed candidate, Minnesota State Sen. Omar Fateh, recently won the Democratic-Farm-Labor Party's nomination for the Minneapolis mayoral race when he defeated incumbent Mayor Jacob Frey in the DFL primary. BILLBOARD ENCOURAGES NEW YORKERS TO 'FLEE' MAMDANI, MOVE TO THIS STATE INSTEAD Fateh has called for creating a local income tax to \"ensure the wealthy pay their fair share,\" as well as creating a \"commercial vacancy tax to address vacant storefronts and a land value tax to incentivize development of underutilized parcels.\" He has also proposed increasing the construction of public housing and implementing a rent stabilization policy. GOVERNMENT-FUNDED GROCERY STORE FLOUNDERS IN MIDWEST CITY AS SIMILAR PROPOSAL GAINS STEAM IN NYC Several cities that have elected progressive or socialist mayors have seen large businesses reduce their footprint in the city or relocate their headquarters entirely. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson defeated the Windy City's incumbent mayor, Lori Lightfoot, in 2023 on a progressive platform, but high taxes and public safety issues have become an issue in keeping companies and their employees in the city. REAL ESTATE EXPERT WARNS SOCIALIST MAYORAL CANDIDATE COULD TRIGGER MASSIVE NYC EXODUS The period at the end of Lightfoot's tenure saw Boeing, Caterpillar, Citadel, Guggenheim Partners, TTX and Tyson Foods move their headquarters or significant parts of their operations out of the city.

    "text": "Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Shares Are Now Green 4:59 pm by Eric Bleeker Shares of Tesla are now green. While growth rates last quarter were poor, that was expected by Wall Street headed into today&#8217;s earnings. The company announcing they&#8217;ve begun preoduction of a more affordable vehicle in the first half is somewhat of a surprise and I&#8217;d expected Wall Street will focus on that in commentary tomorrow. We&#8217;ve already seen one &#8216;bullish&#8217; analyst note from Cantor Fitzgerald today that focuses on the plans for new vehicles being on track, I&#8217;d expect several more. Wall Street Starts Weighing In 4:45 pm by Eric Bleeker Cantor Fitzgerald has issued a research note on Tesla&#8217;s second quarter. They maintain an &#8216;overweight&#8217; rating and were most pleased by the disclosure that new vehicle plans (including a more affordable model) remain on track. Tesla&#039;s Earnings Deck on Robotaxis 4:43 pm by Eric Bleeker &#8220;In June, we launched our Robotaxi service in the first city, Austin, with a safety rider. We will further improve and expand the service (more vehicles covering a larger area, eventually without a safety rider) while testing in other U.S. cities in anticipation of additional launches. Our efforts to refine the Robotaxi offering in Austin are not location-specific and will allow us to scale to other cities quickly with marginal investment. We achieved the world&#8217;s first autonomous delivery to a customer with a new production Model Y driving itself ~30 minutes from the factory across town to its new owner&#8217;s home, including on highways. We expanded AI training compute with an additional 16k H200 GPUs at Gigafactory Texas, bringing Cortex to a total of 67k H100 equivalents.&#8220; Q&amp;A Begins at 5:30 p.m. ET 4:42 pm by Eric Bleeker You can listen in by visiting Tesla&#8217;s investor relations page. Options Markets Were Right 4:31 pm by Eric Bleeker Options markets were pretty sleepy headed into Tesla&#8217;s options and it looks like they&#8217;ll be right. The market reaction has been muted so far with shares down a little more than one percent as of 4:30 p.m. ET. Growth Rates 4:30 pm by Eric Bleeker What kidn of growth rates did Tesla see compared to last year? Here&#8217;s a summary of some key financial metrics: Metric Q2 25 Q2 24 YoY Change Revenue $22.50B $25.50B -11.78% Operating Income $923.00M $1.60B -42.49% Net Income $1.19B $1.48B -19.49% Operating Cash Flow $2.54B $3.61B -29.68% Capital Expenditures $2.39B $2.27B 5.37% Free Cash Flow $146.00M $1.34B -89.10% Cash And Equivalents $36.78B $15.01B 145.07% Volume Production of More Affordable Model By the End of the Year 4:20 pm by Eric Bleeker That should get some investor attention! More on Earnings... 4:18 pm by Eric Bleeker Tesla reported its financial results for Q2 2025, marking a significant transition in its business strategy. The company generated $22.5 billion in total revenue, a 12% decline year-over-year, primarily due to decreased vehicle deliveries and lower average selling prices. Despite these challenges, Tesla achieved a non-GAAP net income of $1.4 billion and a non-GAAP EPS of $0.40, matching the estimated EPS of $0.40. The company launched its first Robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, and plans to expand its autonomous vehicle offerings. Tesla also highlighted the growth of its Energy business, with record energy storage deployments. The company maintains a strong cash position with $36.8 billion in cash and investments, although free cash flow was significantly reduced to $146 million. CEO Elon Musk emphasized the company&#8217;s focus on autonomy, energy, and robotics as key growth areas. Tesla&#8217;s strategic investments in AI and R&amp;D continue despite a challenging macroeconomic environment. Tesla Largely In-Line 4:17 pm by Eric Bleeker Here&#8217;s some highlights from Tesla&#8217;s Q2 earnings: Tesla Launches First Robotaxi Service in Austin Tesla&#8217;s Energy Business Achieves Record Storage Deployments Tesla&#8217;s Revenue Declines 12% Amid Lower Vehicle Deliveries Elon Musk Highlights Tesla&#8217;s Transition to AI and Robotics Leadership Tesla Maintains Strong Cash Position Despite Reduced Free Cash Flow Tesla Earnings Are Out 4:14 pm by Eric Bleeker EPS of $.40 and revenue of $22.5 billion Still no earnings.. 4:08 pm by Eric Bleeker Alphabet just released solid earnings but we&#8217;re still waiting on Tesla. We will post the numbers and our full analysis once they hit newswires. Tax Credit Muddies Analysis 3:58 pm by Eric Bleeker Earnings are coming very soon. As we await them, keep one thing in mind: the expiration of EV tax credits will make analyzing Q3 deliveries much more difficult. Even with this &#8220;pull forward&#8221; of demand, Wall Street still expects Q4 deliveries to be stronger than Q3. 10 Minute Warning 3:50 pm by Eric Bleeker We are almost to the closing bell. Tesla will be reporting in 10 minutes and we&#8217;ll immediately start posting news and analysis. Once again, simply stay on this page and new updates should appear. It&#039;s About More than EPS Tonight 3:44 pm by Eric Bleeker We previewed the numbers Wall Street expects Tesla to hit earlier. If you missed them, here are consensus expectations: Revenue: $22.1 billion EPS (Normalized): $0.40 Yet, Tesla had an abysmal prior quarter and shares are up 46% since their closing price on the day before the company last issued earnings. Clearly, investors are more interested in developments in areas like Tesla&#8217;s Robotax network and Optimus than they are whether EPS beats or misses by a few pennies in a given quarter. Today, news broke that Tesla was discussing expanding Robotaxi service to Las Vegas. It has been expected that the Bay Area would be a logical next market after Austin. Any commentary from Musk around Robotaxi&#8217;s rollout and expansion plans will likely factor into tomorrow&#8217;s share price reaction a lot more than the EPS and revenue figures Tesla announces for last quarter. Options Markets 3:41 pm by Eric Bleeker Options markets are placing a 50% chance on a move over 8.15% when Tesla reports tonight. Overall, options volume is significantly lighter than recent reports. We&#8217;ll see if this light activity translates to a muted reaction from the market tomorrow. Breaking Before Earnings 3:37 pm by Eric Bleeker A little breaking news before Tesla reports tonight. At 2:45 p.m. ET, Bloomberg published a story that Tesla is in talks with Nevada to expand Robotaxi operations to the state. The Las Vegas area would be Robotaxi&#8217;s second market after launching in Austin, Texas. As you can imagine, investors will be paying extremely close attention to Robotaxi commentary on Tesla&#8217;s conference call tonight. Tesla Shares Flat Headed Into Earnings 3:35 pm by Eric Bleeker We are just 25 minutes from the closing bell and Tesla shares are largely flat on the day. After hitting nearly $336 per share midday, Tesla is now trading for $332 per share, or up .22% on the day. As a reminder, we&#8217;ll be posting live analysis right after earnings are released. Simply stay on this page and new updates will load. We expect earnings to release shortly after 4 p.m. ET. Tesla (Nasdaq:TSLA) reports Q2 2025 earnings after the market closes today. With Wall Street expecting a modest sequential rebound from a disruptive first quarter. Revenue: $22.1 billion EPS (Normalized): $0.40 FY 2025 Revenue: $95.2 FY 2025 EPS: $1.78 After three of the last four quarters delivered negative surprises and stock declines, the key question now is whether Q2 can reset sentiment. Tesla shares fell 6.1% on Q1 results in April, and finished -7.9% lower two weeks later. The pattern has been clear: unless Tesla surprises on margins, product execution, or autonomy traction, investors are unimpressed. Big Question About Deliveries Management has spent recent calls pivoting the discussion toward deliverables. In Q1, CEO Elon Musk confirmed that Tesla would begin production of its new, lower-cost vehicle platform in June, with line validation underway at Giga Texas. This model — a long-awaited lever to scale volume and penetrate new markets — introduces ASP compression risk but could re-energize the equity if early production milestones are met. Right now, Wall Street is expecting 435,000 deliveries in the third quarter. By the fourth quarter, those estimates ramp to 474,000. For perspective, last quarter came in at 384,122. Tesla&#8217;s peak deliveries were Q4 of last year when the company delivered 495,570 automobiles. Non-EV Businesses Investors are also watching for concrete updates on Tesla’s Robotaxi pilot, which Musk claimed would go live in Austin this summer. As of Q1, no commercial regulatory detail had been disclosed, raising credibility questions. CFO Vaibhav Taneja reiterated that Tesla would spend over $10 billion in CapEx this year — including on AI infrastructure, Optimus, and localized manufacturing — and highlighted tariff risk on China-sourced equipment as a rising cost issue. The Energy segment could again be a bright spot. Q1 saw record gross profit, even as deployments fell, and Tesla continues to cite strong Megapack demand. Meanwhile, Services and Other continue to dilute margins, and management acknowledged brand hostility and vandalism as lingering headwinds to volume recovery. Bottomline To trigger a meaningful post-earnings rebound, Tesla likely needs to: Affirm June production start for the low-cost model Show sequential margin recovery in auto Provide visible progress on autonomy or AI monetization Absent that, the recent trend — beat on vision, miss on financials — may keep the stock rangebound.

Reports claim AMD will raise the price of these GPUs to $25,000 per unit, according to TipRanks.com. Nasdaq Heading to Higher Highs 9:54 am The Nasdaq is up about 70 points at the open, last trading at 21,177.76. Adding to the upside, AMZN is up about $1.43 a share ahead of earnings. NVDA is gaining momentum, up about $1.45. AMD is also up big, gaining about $7.20, last trading at $173.63. Stock futures are mixed, but the Nasdaq is expected to open higher. Fueling upside, President Trump announced that the U.S. reached an agreement with the European Union to lower tariffs to 15%. Magnificent 7 stocks, including Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple, are all set to post earnings this week. Investors will be listening for comments on strengthening artificial intelligence spending to gauge the justifiability of tech stock valuations. Helping, “While expectations were low coming into this season, results so far show corporate America is faring better than expected. Of the more than 30% of the S&amp;P 500 done reporting, more than 82% beat Wall Street’s forecasts,” added CNBC. Later this week, the Federal Reserve will hold its two-day meeting. The central bank is widely expected to leave interest rates as is. However, investors will be looking for an indication of a potential rate cut by September. Defense Stocks are Rallying on the US-EU Trade Deal Defense stocks are also gaining momentum after the US-EU trade deal. As part of that deal, President Trump said the EU would be “purchasing hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of military equipment,” as quoted by CNBC. In addition, as announced shortly after the agreement, Europe will also purchase about $750 billion worth of energy. &#8220;They are going to agree to invest into the United States $600 billion more than they&#8217;re investing already. So, they&#8217;re investing a large amount of money,” added President Trump, as quoted by The Mirror.

    "site": "https://247wallst.com",
    "text": "Elon Musk has quite the career history, manning an assortment of projects, from electrical vehicle building to space rocket launching. And now he adds owning a Los Angeles diner to the list. The Tesla Diner and Drive In, a retro restaurant offering futuristic design and 24-hour service, opened on July 21 in West Hollywood. The 80 charging stalls feature large movie screens, while the popcorn and other menu items are served to customers via robots. The new establishment was highly anticipated and has certainly drawn crowds. However, three-hour wait times and limited menu items have also drawn criticism. And those expecting a decent meal may want to look elsewhere, as visitors say the diner offers high concept entertainment versus a culinary experience. In addition to the above, Musk also bought Twitter for $44 billion back in 2022. Musk funded the acquisition by selling Tesla stock (NASDAQ: TSLA) and taking $13 billion in loans underwritten mostly by Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), and Barclays (NYSE: BCS). About $10 billion came from outside investors, including Qatar&#8217;s sovereign wealth fund. Since then, Musk has ventured into politics, briefly becoming Trump&#8217;s right-hand man, before entering a notorious rivalry with the president and suggesting the formation of a third political party. Throughout it all, Tesla stock has been all over the map, though mostly struggling. This post was updated on August 1, 2025 to include news of Musk&#8217;s Tesla Diner and Drive In. Lender&#8217;s remorse: banks lose Twitter bet After the Twitter (X) acquisition, the Wall Street Journal reported that lenders were struggling to unload the debt they underwrote for the acquisition. They reportedly faced a combined $2 billion in losses. Ebiquity, a London-based market consultancy, said only two of its 70 clients bought ads on the platform during a particular month. This is down from 31 in the same month last year. How does Elon Musk make his money? Bloomberg says $83 billion of Musk&#8217;s wealth is tied to his Tesla stake. About $53 billion comes from his share of SpaceX. Extremely high-value assets like this can be used to cover personal expenses and investments while drawing little or no federally taxable income. For example, ProPublica reported in 2021 Amazon founder Jeff Bezos paid no federal income tax and claimed a $4,000 child tax credit intended for low-income working families. At the time his net worth was $18 billion. How Elon Musk made his money began in 1995 with just $28,000. The $28,000 question The origin of that money is a matter of dispute. According to “Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future,” the 2015 biography of Musk by tech reporter and writer Ashlee Vance, Errol Musk provided his sons Elon and Kimbal with the money they used to establish Global Link Information Network (renamed Zip2 shortly after). Musk denies getting a handout from his father to establish this early online business directory. He says Zip2 was seeded with $2,000 of his own money, $5,000 from Kimbal, and $8,000 from Gregory Kouri, a well-known angel investor who died in 2012. Musk says his father later invested 10% of about $200,000 in a later angel-funding round that &#8220;would&#8217;ve happened anyway.&#8221; Vance stands by his reporting on Musk’s source of Zip2&#8217;s seed money. Amid the peak of the dot-com boom of the late 90s, when tens of billions of dollars of venture capital was flowing into Silicon Valley, Compaq Computer bought Zip2 for more than $300 million in 1999, just months before the internet bubble burst sending tech stocks crashing. Zip2 became part of AltaVista, Compaq’s search engine. Yahoo! shut down AltaVista in 2013. From $22 million to $180 million Musk, who was 27 years old at the time, walked away from the Zip2 sale with $22 million. His brother netted $15 million from the sale. In 1999, Musk plied much of the proceeds from the Zip2 sale into X.com, an early online bank he co-founded with fellow tech-industry entrepreneurs Harris Fricker, Christopher Payne, and Ed Ho. Months later, X.com merged with Confinity, a software company co-founded by German-American entrepreneur Peter Thiel, to become PayPal. In 2002, eBay bought PayPal for $1.5 billion, turning Musk into a centimillionaire with proceeds of about $180 million Musk invested $100 million of this cash to found SpaceX in 2002 and put $70 million into Tesla the following year. Both companies have astronomical valuations which is the foundation of Musk’s immense wealth.

    "text": "Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Conference Call Is Over 6:10 pm Apple&#8217;s conference call has ended and shares are up 3%. Overall, the company did a lot tonight to push the narrative they&#8217;ll be aggressive to catch up in AI and that device sales are rebounding. It&#8217;s a good quarter for Apple that might start turning around what&#8217;s been a disappointing 2025. Tim Cook on AI 5:58 pm TD Cowen Analst: Tim, I was curious about your thoughts on AI for edge devices. There&#8217;s like some people who think that LLM could be a commodity in the future. Do you think &#8212; do you see a scenario where the LLM become a third part of your iOS or is the SLM the way to go and how to think about evolution of edge devices in a futuristic AI world and is smartphone going to be the choice of device. Just curious your thoughts on it, broadly speaking. Timothy Cook Chief Executive Officer The way that we look at AI is that it&#8217;s 1 of the most profound technologies of our lifetime. And I think it will affect all devices in a significant way what pieces of the chain are commoditized and not commoditized, I wouldn&#8217;t want to to really talk about today. because that gives away some things on our strategy. But I think it&#8217;s a good question. . Tim Cook on Apple Momentum 5:48 pm Here&#8217;s what Tim Cook had to say about Apple&#8217;s surprising momentum in China last quarter: &#8220;Yes. We did grow in Greater China by 4% during the quarter versus the previous quarter, it was driven by an acceleration by iPhone, although we also had substantial growth on the MAC year-over-year. From a &#8212; as you know, the government has placed certain subsidies that affects some of our products, not all of them, but there are some of them. And I think that had some effect. It was the first full quarter of the subsidy playing out. that cut in during a portion of the previous quarter. The other things I would say are that the installed base hit a record high in Greater China &#8212; and we set an all-time record for the iPhone installed base. The iPhone upgraders in Mainland China set a record for the June quarter. And according to Boral Panel, which was formerly known as Kantar, iPhone had the top 3 models in Urban China, which is extraordinary. Also, if you look at the other products, Mac, iPad and watch, the majority of customers that are buying in China Mainland were new to the product. So lots of good things there. And the other thing I would point out, which is an interesting point, The MacBook Air was the top-selling laptop model in all of China, and the Mac Mini was the top-selling desktop model in all of China. So overall, a positive &#8212; very positive quarter.&#8221; Apple&#039;s CFO Says AI Investments Will Rise 5:47 pm &#8220;I would say, a pretty significant driver as Tim talked about, is the fact we are increasing our investment significantly in AI. So that is certainly a component of it. As you know, we&#8217;ve been investing in private cloud compute, which is also in our first-party data centers. The other piece, as you know, is we do have a hybrid strategy where in cases we do use third parties to make capital investments, and we also invest in our own. So you are going to see an increase in CapEx. We also, from time to time, have other investments in facilities in tooling, but I would say a significant portion of the driver of growth that you&#8217;re seeing now is really driven by some of our AI-related investments.&#8221; &#8211; Kevan Parekh, Apple CFO Tariff Implications 5:22 pm On Apple&#8217;s conference call they just said they incurred $800 million in tariff-related costs last quarter.

Apple&#8217;s CEO, Tim Cook, highlighted the company&#8217;s success at the WWDC25 event, where new software designs and Apple Intelligence features were introduced. The board declared a cash dividend of $0.26 per share, payable on August 14, 2025. The earnings call is scheduled for July 31, 2025. Despite the positive results, Apple acknowledged potential risks related to global economic conditions and competitive markets. iPhone Net Sales Crush 4:34 pm iPhone net sales hit $44.58 billion, that&#8217;s way ahead of Wall Street expectations and were responsible for almost the entire quarter&#8217;s beat.

Yet, shares continue trending down. They&#8217;re now up a little more than 1%. We&#8217;ll continue digging into why enthusiasm hasn&#8217;t kept up from the initial &#8216;pop.&#8217; China Back to Growth 4:31 pm It looks like the bleeding has stopped in China, Apple saw growth in the region.

    "text": "Late last year, Lucid Group Inc. (NASDAQ: LCID) began production of its highly anticipated Gravity luxury electric SUV. The vehicle was touted for its impressive horsepower and acceleration, and for its long-range capabilities. The SUV was a driver for Lucid&#8217;s strong 2025 sales growth forecast as well. This year, the company announced it would acquire production facilities from bankrupt electric truck maker Nikola, as well as management changes, including the chief executive stepping down and the chief operating officer becoming interim CEO. Actor Timothée Chalamet was named as its first-ever Global Brand Ambassador. And Lucid made a robotaxi deal with Uber, and it has considered a reverse stock split. The first-quarter net loss was smaller than expected, and the company posted its sixth consecutive quarter of record deliveries. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: Lucid Group Inc. (NASDAQ: LCID) is a luxury EV maker with significant backing from the Saudi government. Though offering technology superior to other EV makers, it comes at a higher cost, at a time when the company has cut prices to try to be competitive. However, 24/7 Wall St. sees huge upside for the stock through 2030. If you’re looking for some stocks with huge potential, make sure to grab a free copy of our “The Next NVIDIA” report. It features a software stock we’re confident has 10X potential. Recent news helped the share price rise more than 45% in the past month, before giving up most of that gain. The stock now is 6.9% lower than 90 days ago, well underperforming the broader markets. The stock has been fairly volatile in the past year, with shares trading in a range of $1.93 to $4.43. Luxury electric vehicle maker Lucid was a highly anticipated startup in 2021 when it went public through a reverse merger with the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Churchill Capital IV. Majority-owned by the Saudi government&#8217;s Public Investment Fund (PIF) sovereign wealth fund, the merger attracted $4.5 billion in new capital. The stock quickly ran up from its opening price of $25.24 on July 26, 2021, to an intraday high of $56.70 on Nov. 30, giving it a market cap of $90 billion. It made Lucid more valuable than Ford Motor Co. (NYSE: F). However, more than four years later, Lucid trades for less $3.00 per share, a loss of over 90% of its value. The decline is the result of production issues, sharply falling demand for electric vehicles (EVs), and a sticker price that was far greater than the market would bear. The question is where Lucid stock goes from here. 24/7 Wall St. offers readers insights into our assumptions about the stock’s prospects, what sort of growth we see in the stock for the next several years, and our best estimates for Lucid&#8217;s share price each year through 2030. Lucid’s Performance Lucid has suffered from production issues, weak sales, bloated inventory, and waning demand for EVs The table summarizes performance in share price, revenues, and operating losses from 2021 through 2024, its first years as a public company. Year Share Price Revenue Operating Loss 2021 $38.05 $27,111 ($1,530,446) 2022 $6.83 $608,181 ($2,593,991) 2023 $4.21 $595,271 ($3,099,580) 2024 $2.10 $807,832 ($3,020,820) Share price at year&#8217;s end; revenue and operating loss in millions. Now let’s take a look at Lucid’s production and delivery schedule for each quarter: Produced Delivered Unsold Inventory Q2 2022 1,405 679 726 Q3 2022 2,282 1,398 1,610 Q4 2022 3,493 1,932 3,171 Q1 2023 2,314 1,406 4,079 Q2 2023 2,173 1,404 4,848 Q3 2023 1,550 1,457 4,941 Q4 2023 2,391 1,734 5,598 Q1 2024 1,728 1,967 5,359 Q2 2024 2,110 2,394 5,075 Q3 2024 1,805 2,781 4,099 Q4 2024 3,386 3,099 4,386 Source: Lucid Group SEC filings. In the third quarter, Lucid had operating losses of over $770.5 million, meaning it lost $27,707 for every car it sold. And the more vehicles it makes, the more it loses, with little indication it can turn its operation around. Looked at another way, Lucid lost almost $7.4 million every single day of 2024. Lucid’s grandiose plans to produce 49,000 EVs by 2023 and half a million by 2025 quickly fell apart. As of the end of the first quarter, it had delivered only 21,351 EVs to customers so far. Three Key Drivers of Lucid’s Stock Performance Saudi backing, price cuts, and technological superiority. Building the Saudi Arabian auto industry. The Saudi government is seeking to diversify away from its reliance upon oil for its revenue. It wants to create an auto industry from the ground up and Lucid is the vehicle it is using to develop it. The sovereign wealth fund is willing to invest heavily into the money-losing operation, having provided the EV maker with nearly $8 billion in funding. Cutting prices. Lucid initiated a series of price cuts to keep pace with the rest of the EV industry amid waning demand, making them more competitive with Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA). EV technological superiority. Lucid got its start as a maker of electric drivetrains that it wanted to sell to other EV manufacturers, but changed direction to make the entire car. Its vehicles offer superior performance and range than Tesla, though at a significantly higher cost. Yet as it cut prices to remain competitive, performance declined to become just par with comparable Tesla. Lucid Stock Forecast Through 2030 Analyst sentiment is mixed. Fifteen analysts covering Lucid Group have a 12-month consensus price target of $2.67 per share. That implies 12.7% upside from where it currently trades, and targets range from a low of $1 per share (or 57.8% downside) to a high of $7 per share (195.4% upside). Wall Street, on average, has a Hold rating on the stock. Valuing Lucid&#8217;s stock price for the coming years, beginning with forecast revenue of $1.08 billion for 2025, which represents 39% growth year over year. As Lucid has cut prices to spur demand, sales have grown, but it still has substantial unsold inventory. It makes it questionable how many new cars dealers will accept. We shall assign Lucid stock a price-to-sales ratio of 5x as the market continues to assign a higher multiple to the automaker, which puts our price target at $3.44 per share. Going into 2026, we estimate the price to be $4.77 per share despite weak sales growth of just 5% to $1.134 billion and a P/S ratio of 2.3, which puts it closer to its peers. Yet, the new Gravity SUV, which starts at $81,400 for the Touring model and $96,400 for the Grand Touring model, suggests Lucid will find a very small, niche market for its EVs. Particularly because they will not be eligible for any federal tax credits, it could kill off demand. There is also the question whether the Private Investment Fund eventually tires of pouring billions of dollars into an enterprise continuously losing billions. The EV maker&#8217;s cash burn is some $3 billion a year. Despite the fund&#8217;s desire to jumpstart a new auto industry and using Lucid Group to help its workforce develop the necessary skills, further financing could dry up. Assuming Lucid continues to increase in sales, 24/7 Wall St. sees the share price reaching $7.84 by the end of 2030. That represents upside potential of over 284% for the stock by the conclusion of the decade. Here is a look at how it gets there: Year Price Target Upside Potential 2025 $3.44 45.1% 2026 $4.27 80.2% 2027 $5.11 115.6% 2028 $5.93 150.2% 2029 $6.82 187.8% 2030 $7.84 230.8% Can Lucid Stock Make You a Millionaire?

    "text": "Live Updates Live Coverage Updates appear automatically as they are published. Nasdaq up 300 at the Open 9:54 am Despite a poor outing on Friday, the Nasdaq just opened 300 points higher. All as investors attempt to shake off trade war and job uncertainty. The Dow Jones is up 340. The S&amp;P 500 is up 61. Gold prices are up by $13.82 at $3,381.98. Oil is down $1.70 at $65.63. Shares of Tesla Are Racing Higher in Pre-Market 8:58 am Shares of Tesla (TSLA) are accelerating on news that the company just approved a compensation package for CEO Elon Musk, which consists of 96 million shares of restricted stock valued at about $29 billion. On Semiconductor is down after issuing third-quarter guidance of 54 cents to 64 cents, with analysts expecting 58 cents. The lower end of the expected revenue of $1.465 billion to $1.565 billion also fell short of estimates of $1.50 billion. Bank of America Reiterated a Buy Rating on Nvidia 8:44 am After dropping late last week on jobs growth and tariff concerns, the Nasdaq is turning aggressively higher in the pre-market. At the moment, it’s up 188 points at 23,073.75 Bank of America just reiterated its buy rating on Nvidia, noting it sees a strong beat/raise when it posts earnings later this month. UBS just initiated a buy rating on Pony AI with a price target of $20. Evercore ISI reiterated an outperform rating on Amazon, noting, “We reiterate our Outperform on AMZN in the wake of our proprietary research into Alexa+, Amazon’s AI Agent currently being rolled out to its Echo platform devices. We have tested Alexa+ on and off for two weeks now and have run our own proprietary survey of 1,350 current Smart Device owners,” as quoted by CNBC. Markets were doing well until the latest tariffs and a slowdown in jobs created uncertainty. Non-farm payrolls came in at 73,000 with prior months revised lower. With the latest numbers, investors are digesting what it could mean for interest rates. At the moment, investors are betting on reduced chances for a September cut. Unfortunately, the probability of a September fell to 40%, according to the CME FedWatch tool. With tariffs, Trump signed an executive order that modified reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries, with updated duties ranging from 10% to 41%. It’s why the Dow dropped 542 points on Friday, why the S&amp;P 500 shed 101, and why the NASDAQ lost 472 points. This morning, in an attempt to brush off the negativity, the major indices are exploding in the pre-market. The Dow Jones is up about 192. The S&amp;P 500 is up about 35, as the NASDAQ tacks on about 174 points. It’ll be interesting to see if they can hold the gains – especially with the latest tariffs, the potential for a worsening trade war, and jobs. We also have to consider that August is historically a weak month for the Dow, heading back to 1988, according to CNBC. It’s the second-worst month for the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq. Key Earnings are on Deck Key earnings from Palantir, Disney, McDonald’s, Advanced Micro Devices, and Eli Lilly will also help decide the markets’ direction. This morning, Tyson Foods posted better-than-expected earnings. EPS of 91 cents was above expectations of 80 cents. Revenue of $13.88 billion was also above the estimates of $13.54 billion. It also raised its revenue guidance for the full year, expecting an increase in production for certain meat products like chicken. Berkshire Hathaway saw a year-over-year decline in operating earnings, which fell 4% to $11.16 billion. All thanks to week insurance writing. Warren Buffett also warned that steep tariffs would hurt its business. &#8220;The pace of changes in these events, including tensions from developing international trade policies and tariffs, accelerated through the first six months of 2025,&#8221; Berkshire said in its earnings report. &#8220;Considerable uncertainty remains as to the ultimate outcome of these events.&#8221; OPEC+ Just Agreed to Raise Oil Production OPEC+ just agreed to raise oil production by 547,000 barrels per day for September. This is the latest in a series of accelerated output hikes to regain market share, especially with concerns mounting over potential supply disruptions linked to Russia. “Given fairly strong oil prices at around $70, it does give OPEC+ some confidence about market fundamentals,&#8221; said Amrita Sen, co-founder of Energy Aspects, adding that the market structure was also indicating tight stocks, as quoted by CNBC.

    "text": "Through the first seven months of the year, F-Series sales were 39% of Ford Motor Co.’s (NYSE: F) total U.S. sales. That shows how much the company depends on its full-size pickups. Most of these are the F-150, which has been the bestselling vehicle in the United States for almost five decades. It also shows the extent to which Ford has a challenge to diversify away from gasoline-powered cars, which make up nearly all its profits. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: The F-Series remains a significant part of Ford Motor Co.’s (NYSE: F) total U.S. sales. The F-150 has been the bestselling vehicle in America for decades. Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) Sales of the F-150 yield $10,000 in profits each, an indication of how much it contributes to Ford’s bottom line. One question Ford has to face financially is, if it moves successfully into electric vehicles (EVs), what happens to its profits? Will sales of its electric F-150 Lightning cannibalize sales of the gasoline-powered version? Ford objects to the math, but it loses about $100,000 on each EV it sells. A rotation from conventional models to EVs could cost the automaker hundreds of millions of dollars. CEO Jim Farley said recently that U.S. car companies cannot match the quality and prices of Chinese EVs. He says Ford will have a “Model T” moment on August 11. This implies that the company will relaunch its EV initiative after spending nearly $30 billion on the first wave—and losing it. Farley could point out that the first investment is a foundation for a new one. If this so-called Model-T moment is largely to start a new generation of what could be a decades-long transformation of the company, where will the money come from? He has complained about what the new United Auto Workers contract will cost Ford. He has also acknowledged the loss that the company has to take in the EV market. Recently, he added that tariffs will undermine the company’s bottom line further. At the core of Ford’s financials are its warranty costs, which do not seem to be going away. The F-150 is the foundation of Ford’s financial success. What happens when that is no longer true?

    "text": "Many tech billionaires have lost wealth in 2025 because the share prices in the companies they own mostly remain underwater. As an example, Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock is down 2% this year, while the S&amp;P 500 is up 6%. That hurts Jeff Bezos’ net worth. Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) is down 25%, which undermines Elon Musk’s net worth. One “billionaire” stock is up. Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT) trades 9% above where it was at the start of the year. And the net worth of the Walton family has risen with it. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: Among the richest people in the world, only the Walton family has become wealthier this year. Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT) stock is up sharply year to date. Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) Of the 15 richest people in the world according to the Bloomberg Billionaire list, only the Walton family has posted a large increase in their wealth. Jim, Rob, and Alice have each had a gain of about $300 million. They are the children of Walmart founder Sam Walton. Walmart is currently the largest retailer in the world (China might be an exception). Walmart has done several things to cement its position as a retailer. It says it has passed some of the price of tariffs on to customers. This should preserve margins. J.P. Morgan recently said Walmart should be highly successful this year. The pricing power advantage was among the reasons. Walmart has also made gains in the artificial intelligence (AI) part of retail. Walmart hired Instacart executive Daniel Danker to run its growing AI business. He will oversee “AI transformation and lead all product management and design across the enterprise.” It has added “super agents” to help online customers. Yahoo reports, “According to the retailer, the four agents powered by agentic AI are designed for Walmart shoppers, store employees, suppliers and sellers, and software developers.” In May, Walmart posted its earnings. Revenue rose 2.5% year over year to $165.6 billion, while adjusted earnings increased 1.7% to $0.61 per share. The Walton family has another distinction. Among the people at the top of the Bloomberg rich list, they are the only ones who inherited their money.
