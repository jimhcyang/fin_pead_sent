    "text": "Veteran investor Ross Gerber revealed on Sunday that his X account was hacked by “sophisticated” cryptocurrency scammers to promote a coin linked to automotive giant Tesla. What Happened: Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, thanked the X team, especially CEO Linda Yaccarino, for the quick resolution. Gerber told Benzinga by mail that the account recovery took 30 minutes. “Considering it was a Tesla crypto scam coin, I was specifically targeted in this attack,” Gerber disclosed. He clarified that he doesn’t promote cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin to his clients. My account was hacked yesterday by very sophisticated crypto scammers. Sorry for any confusion caused by this hack. Twitter/X responded rapidly and was very helpful. Special thanks to @lindayaX for being the best. Gerber, an early investor in the Elon Musk-led giant, has significantly reduced his fund's stake in the company since November and set a six-month ultimatum for Tesla to improve its performance before potentially exiting the stock entirely. “It's possible it was an inside job at X; not sure if they’re investigating it,” Gerber said, voicing doubts about the social media behemoth, which is also controlled by Musk. X didn’t immediately return Benzinga’s request for comment. See Also: Elon Musk’s DOGE Department Reportedly Eyes Blockchain To Slash Federal Spending—Justin Sun Says Tron A Good Option Why It Matters: Gerber’s hacking incident comes a month after a warning by himself on such possibilities. Gerber alarmed investors about the potential for fraud in the crypto market in December, especially with coins other than Bitcoin BTC/USD. He noted that the appointment of crypto-friendly individuals in the Donald Trump administration wouldn’t necessarily protect retail investors from scams. Gerber’s incident follows a recent case where Ivanka Trump publicly rejected a fake cryptocurrency being promoted under her name.",

    "text": "Vice President JD Vance, who was backed by PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, has voiced his concerns about the influence of big tech companies, asserting that these companies wield “too much power.” What Happened: Speaking on “Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan” on Saturday, Vance was asked about the prominent presence of tech leaders at Donald Trump’s inauguration. This included names like Meta Platforms, Inc.’s META Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon.com, Inc.’s AMZN Jeff Bezos, Tesla Inc.’s TSLA Elon Musk, Apple Inc.’s AAPL Tim Cook, and Alphabet Inc.’s GOOG GOOGL Sundar Pichai. To illustrate his point, the Vice President noted that the tech leaders did not receive preferential seating over his mother or other supporters. “We believe fundamentally that big tech does have too much power.” See Also: Nvidia Stock Slides Overnight On Robinhood As China’s DeepSeek Sparks Doubts Over GPU Spending Frenzy — Chamath Palihapitiya Highlights Report Indicating AI Holy Grail Cracked He stressed the importance of tech companies respecting constitutional rights and halting censorship and cautioned that Trump’s administration would not look kindly on non-compliance. Why It Matters: The tech sector played a crucial role in Trump’s 2024 election victory, with Musk investing significantly in support of Trump and other Republicans. Trump appointed Musk to lead a new agency focused on reducing federal spending. Other tech leaders also engaged with Trump, visiting Mar-a-Lago before the inauguration. Vance has been vocal about his desire to break up large tech companies, particularly Google's parent company Alphabet. Interestingly, the Vice President had a powerful Silicon Valley backer in the share of Thiel who has also funded his 2022 Ohio campaign with $15 million. Image via Shutterstock",

    "text": "Tesla Inc. TSLA executive Wes Morrill said on Saturday that he continues to have “social etiquette” complaints about the company’s full self-driving (FSD) driver assistance technology and is increasingly surprised by its capabilities. What Happened: Morrill said in a post on X that FSD is driving without much of his intervention now. Still, he continues to have social etiquette complaints such as waiting “too long” at a four-way or not accelerating fast enough at the highway on-ramp. “And every once in a while there is a weird situation I think “okay I’m probably going to need to intervene here” and then I’m surprised when FSD just gracefully does the right thing,” Morrill said in a post on X. This what I've been telling people who ask. My remaining complaints are all social etiquette things. Waiting too long at a four-way or not accelerating fast enough at the highway on-ramp. And every once in a while there is a weird situation I think \"okay I'm probably going to… https://t.co/Dg6XtPZ6Ia FSD is an advanced driver assistance system that allows for hands-off driving. While the system provides for automatic lane changes, among other things, it still requires active driver supervision and for the driver to take over in situations where they believe the system cannot perform adequately. Why It Matters: Tesla is optimistic that FSD will enable vehicle autonomy with future versions of the software. However, as of date, it is yet to make vehicles wholly autonomous. “It’s learning, but does still need supervision. Getting longer and longer between interventions,” Morill said in a post-reply about its improvements. Older versions ran over curbs for me, but recent builds I haven't hit a curb even in those same areas. It's learning, but does still need supervision. Getting longer and longer between interventions. However, FSD has also been under the radar of regulators. Earlier this month, U.S. auto safety regulator National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened a probe into about 2.6 million Tesla vehicles equipped with the company’s full self-driving driver assistance technology following a complaint alleging that the use of its “Actually Smart Summon” feature led to a crash. Actually Smart Summon refers to a feature that allows a user to remotely move the vehicle towards themselves or to another nearby location such as a parking lot through the company’s phone app. Check out more of Benzinga's Future Of Mobility coverage by following this link.",

The TSLY ETF's current portfolio is evenly distributed among Bull Puts, Call Credit Spreads, and Long Naked Call, each with precisely 30,743 contracts. TSLY will profit proportionally to TSLA if TSLA trades between $407-$440 and above $472, and outperforms TSLA if TSLA trades below $435.",

    "text": "LEMONT, IL — One person is dead after a car crashed near a stream in Lemont early Wednesday, the Will County Sheriff's Office said. A large emergency response was reported early Wednesday off of Archer Avenue, close to Interstate 355 in Lemont. Will County Sheriff's Office spokesperson Kathy Hoffmeyer told Patch the incident happened at 2:11 a.m. on Wednesday. Initially, Lemont Police and Cook County Sheriff's Office responded to single-vehicle crash of a Tesla Model 3, as well as Homer Fire Department. The fire department extricated the 34-year-old driver from the vehicle. The front seat passenger, a 36-year-old man, was pronounced deceased, according to the sheriff's office. The Will County Coroner's Office has identified him as Sameer Gowani, of Lisle. The driver was taken to the hospital in stable condition. The backseat passenger was ejected from the vehicle and airlifted to the hospital in critical condition, Hoffmeyer said. Hoffmeyer said the vehicle was heading eastbound on 135th Street at a high rate of speed, and lost control while maneuvering the curve west of Archer Avenue. \"The vehicle crossed over the double yellow line into oncoming westbound traffic, struck the curb on the north side of the roadway,\" Hoffmeyer said. \"The vehicle then went airborne, touching down in a grassy area near the entrance of the Target store. The vehicle then continued in a northeast direction, over a raised median, and struck another curb before going down the embankment.\" The car went over Long Run Creek, and came to a stop on the east side of the creek. Hoffmeyer said charges have not been filed for the driver but are being reviewed at this time.",

    "image": "https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/the-tesla-model-s-was-my-dream-car-but-20250210.jpg",
    "site": "https://247wallst.com",
    "text": "Since the Tesla Model S was released, it has wowed worldwide with its giant touchscreen, fast performance, self-driving, and oh-so-much storage (the frunk!). The reality is that owning a Tesla has gone from a fad to mainstream, as the Model Y is now one of the best-selling cars in the world. Key Points The Tesla Model S was the company’s first truly successful automobile. The spartan interior of the vehicle has left customers wanting more. The lack of a large Supercharger network is a big concern. 4 million Americans are set to retire this year. If you want to join them, click here now to see if you’re behind, or ahead. It only takes a minute. (Sponsor) However, just because the Tesla Model Y is a hit doesn’t mean that the Tesla Model S should continue to be your dream car. Along with its hefty price tag, one might want to look at other, perhaps more luxurious, options like the Porsche Taycan, BMW i5, or the Mercedes-Benz EQE instead. 20. Elon Musk There’s no way around it, but the consistent controversies around Elon Musk have led people to surrender their Tesla vehicles, even at a loss. This shouldn’t be a political consideration, but some people believe in protesting with their wallets 19. No Physical Controls Relying solely on the digital display and touchscreen to control your climate settings and radio might seem ideal, but it’s also potentially distracting. While we’d all likely hope to see fewer physical controls on vehicles in the future, Tesla may have taken it too far to fast. 18. Legacy Automakers Are Getting Better When the Tesla Model S launched, it felt like a dream come true as a supercar with lots of range and speed. However, Tesla’s competitors are catching up and, in some ways, surpassing Tesla in terms of overall performance and luxury features. 17. Limited Paint Colors Do you want a yellow or green Tesla Model S? If so, you’re out of luck, as you have only five colors and just two wheels. This is a significant concern with Tesla as the number of options available to personalize your car is very limited. 16. Environmental Concerns The hope is that driving an electric vehicle is better for the environment than a gas engine. However, when you get into the nitty gritty about how electric cars are built, you’ll discover some concerning lithium and cobalt mining issues that border on unethical. 15. No Apple CarPlay or Android Auto There is no question this one is a deal breaker for yours truly, as I can’t live without Apple CarPlay. For reasons unknown, Tesla refuses to include support for both CarPlay and Android Auto, much to the disappointment of Model S owners. 14. Insurance Costs As a result of the high price tag and costly repairs, insuring a Tesla Model S can be more expensive than insuring a gas engine vehicle at the same price tag. Even Tesla’s insurance options are often priced too high for most people. 13. Unpredictable Over-The-Air Updates Yes, it’s fantastic that Tesla can deliver updated features and even improved range to your Model S. However, these software updates often arrive at unpredictable times, making it challenging to know when and why they happen. 12. Disappointing Interior Nowadays, we are trained to expect upgraded interiors in even basic car models. Screen sizes have increased, and standard features have become more impressive, but Tesla likes the bare-bones approach. 11. Range Anxiety Because of the finite number of Tesla Supercharging stations, range anxiety is very real. You must consider this if you own a vehicle and can’t always rely on charging it at home. The idea that you can find a gas station on just about every corner is not at all comforting to electric vehicle owners. 10. Long Charging Times While Tesla has done fantastic work improving the overall charging time on the Tesla Model S, it will still take far longer than gassing up your vehicle. This is a massive concern while on a road trip. 9. Battery Degradation Just as gas engines degrade over time as you start racking up the mileage, so can an EV battery. The problem is that replacing a battery on a Tesla Model S can cost you upward of $20,000 dollars. 8. Depreciation Concerns As much as you might be okay with spending a lot on the Tesla Model S for what it can do, you have to be equally okay with knowing that depreciation might be a shocking surprise when you try to get rid of the vehicle. 7. Limited Service Centers You could be in for a problematic headache if you have an issue with a Tesla Model S and don’t live near one of its service centers. Compare the idea that Tesla only has 207 service centers in the United States, compared to 3,000 for Ford. 6. Family Road Trips We can argue whether a Tesla Model S is a good family vehicle or suitable for road trips, but it’s a moot point until charging stations become as prevalent as gas stations. Just take another car. 5. Software Concerns While it’s great that Tesla likes to add fart noises to its vehicles, relying solely on a digital display for 95% of the functionality of a car is all but begging for issues. Hopefully, these will become more consistent, with greater explanations of what each software update is doing behind the scenes. 4. Build Quality Concerns For better or worse, Tesla has become infamous for questionable build quality, which you don’t want to see on a $70,000-plus vehicle. Whether it’s misaligned panels, poor paint job, or difficulties with an electric component, you want and deserve better quality. 3. The Cost With the “base” model Tesla Model S at $73,490 and the Plaid version at $88,490, you’re definitely in competitive territory. You can find different electric vehicles with more luxury features for a similar price, even if you must sacrifice some range. 2. Cold Weather Concerns If you live in a cold weather climate and plan to drive your Tesla Model S regularly, you have to consider you’re going to lose some range. It has been well documented by current Model S owners that even the regenerative brakes don’t function right when driving in cold weather. 1. Questionable Self-Driving As much as Elon Musk and Tesla’s leadership want to tout Full Self-Driving, the technology is not as ready as they claim. While it sounds fantastic, you must pay close attention to the vehicle, as it has been the source of multiple crashes over the years.
