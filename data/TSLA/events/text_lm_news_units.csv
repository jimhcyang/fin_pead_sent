OMAHA, Neb.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Investor Movement Index® (IMX℠) increased to 4.31 in January, up from its score of 4.17 in December. The IMX is TD Ameritrade’s proprietary, behavior-based index, aggregating Main Street investor positions and activity to measure what investors actually were doing and how they were positioned in the markets. The reading for the four-week period ending January 27, 2023 ranks “low” compared to historic averages. “While there’s still a ways to go before the IMX score reaches the soaring heights it hit in 2020 and 2021, optimism among retail investors is beginning to creep back up as this year begins,” said Shawn Cruz, head trading strategist, TD Ameritrade. “With inflation moderating and volatility projections starting to wane, retail investors are continuing to net sell equities but are also on a whole increasing their market exposure, potentially signaling more appetite for exposure in the months to come.” January started off with a sharp bounce after the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ monthly Employment Situation report continued to show an ever-resilient labor market; the unemployment rate stubbornly moved lower to 3.5%, but the report showed an uptick in the participation rate and a slowing pace of wage increases. In the days that followed, the market mostly crept higher until the morning of January 18th when the U.S. Census Bureau’s December Retail Sales data was released, shining light on a disappointing holiday season for retailers. This sent the market into a bit of a tailspin, pushing the S&P 500 down just over 1.5% to its worst finish in the January period. U.S. equities quickly steadied the ship, however, and continued on a “risk-on” course to close out the month, buoyed by optimism from corporate earnings releases from many of the market’s bellwether companies. The S&P 500 (SPX) charted its strongest period of performance since October ’22, finishing up just over 6%. All of this contributed to the CBOE Market Volatility Index (VIX) touching its lowest level since January 2022 before ending the period at 18.51, possibly indicating an increasing comfort with the uncertainties that have plagued the market for the better part of the last year. U.S. Treasury markets rallied alongside equity markets, leading to a decline in yields, and the U.S. Dollar Index continued its recent slide to finish at its lowest level since May 2022. Crude oil saw steep selling early in January but quickly recovered most of its early-month losses to finish down a modest 1.4% during the period. TD Ameritrade clients were net sellers overall, but they did find individual names to buy during the period, including: Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Rivian Automotive Inc. (RIVN) Ford Motor Co. (F) Apple Inc. (AAPL) Intel Corp. (INTC) Names sold during the period included: Meta Platforms Inc. (META) Boeing Co. (BA) American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL) Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) Netflix Inc. (NFLX) Millennial Buys & Sells TD Ameritrade millennial clients also increased exposure during the January IMX period, but like the overall TD Ameritrade client population, they were net sellers of equities. Both TD Ameritrade millennial clients and the overall TD Ameritrade client population were net buyers of Tesla (TSLA) as the electric vehicle (EV) maker reported earnings and ended its recent run of weakness with a surge of over 44% during the period. This optimism spilled over to another EV maker, Rivian Automotive (RIVN), as both populations were net buyers of the company, seeing opportunity in its early January weakness. TD Ameritrade millennial clients took it one step further and also net bought Lucid Group (LCID) as takeover speculation late in January contributed to a massive run-up of over 88% during the period. Both TD Ameritrade millennial clients and the overall TD Ameritrade client population were net sellers of American Airlines (AAL), seeing an opportunity to sell into strength as the company soared over 30% following an optimistic update to its guidance forecast early in the month and as it beat street estimates with its earnings on January 26th. TD Ameritrade millennial clients also reduced exposure in United Airlines (UAL) as the Chicago-based airliner also jumped nearly 30%, using the strength as an opportunity to sell. Although TD Ameritrade millennial clients were net sellers of equities during the January period, they were net buyers of three of the S&P sectors: Health Care, Real Estate, and Utilities. About the IMX The IMX value is calculated based on a complex proprietary formula. Each month, TD Ameritrade pulls a sample from its client base of funded accounts, which includes all accounts that completed a trade in the past month. The holdings and positions of this statistically significant sample are evaluated to calculate individual scores, and the median of those scores represents the monthly IMX.

Dublin, July 30, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Australia Electric Vehicle Charging Stations Market - Forecasts from 2024 to 2029"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The Australian electric vehicle charging stations market is projected to rise at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.61% to reach a market valuation of US$50.856 million by 2029, from US$22.150 million in 2022. Australia's infrastructure for charging electric vehicles (EVs) has been progressively growing. Government and corporate sector initiatives seek to encourage the increasing number of EVs on the road. Cost and accessibility issues are still present, especially in rural regions. However, continuing government initiatives are attempting to overcome these obstacles, to create a nationwide network for EV charging that is more extensive and easily accessible. The need for charging infrastructure is also rising as a result of people and companies switching to electric cars, growing awareness of climate change, and the need to cut emissions. Furthermore, Australia's growing car sales are driving up demand for EV charging stations, which encourages infrastructure development and investment. On the other hand, weaker car sales might temporarily obstruct expansion while stakeholders reorder their priorities for investments. The correlation emphasizes the importance of EV adoption rates in determining the future course of the charging station sector. As per the Australian Automobile Association, the vehicle sales were significant in 2024. The sales of ICE were 2,48,943, and that for hybrid vehicles was 28,708. Whereas the sales of BEV and PHEV were 21,474 and 4,476, respectively, in January 2024. Moreover, to encourage the market expansion for EV charging stations, the Australian government has implemented financial incentives, including subsidies and tax credits. Regulations require EV charging stations to be included in new construction, guaranteeing public availability. The goal of funding R&D initiatives is to promote innovation by advancing EV technology and charging infrastructure. These programs demonstrate Australia's dedication to cutting emissions and advancing sustainable transportation. The industry is also being propelled ahead by technological developments in EV batteries and charging systems, which result in quicker charging times and greater range. Moreover, collaborations among governmental bodies, utility companies, and commercial enterprises are expediting the investment in charging infrastructure, hence augmenting its proliferation. The EV charging stations market in Australia is expanding overall due to the emergence of renewable energy sources like solar and wind power, which present prospects for the integration of sustainable charging solutions, further fueling the market. Growing investments in electric vehicle charging stations The Australian electric vehicle charging stations market is expected to be considerably driven due to the increase in investment in the charging station infrastructure. For instance, the Australian government has been aggressively subsidizing to boost EV adoption. Consequently, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) announced $871,000 in funding to Intellihub in August 2022 for an Australian first deployment of 50 EV chargers installed on street-side power poles for EV owners without off-street parking across New South Wales on behalf of the Australian Government. Intellihub would install EV chargers on power poles in nine New South Wales local government areas to serve EV owners who live in apartments, townhouses, or units without on-site EV charging. The trial will demonstrate that there are currently no regulatory impediments to using existing infrastructure that already has power going to it, such as street power poles, and it will also aid in understanding the impact of EV chargers on the electricity network. The Australian electric vehicle charging stations market for the public segment is anticipated to grow Australia is seeing an increase in demand for public EV charging stations due to record-breaking sales of battery-powered automobiles. For instance, as of September 2022, 3.39% of new cars sold in Australia were electric vehicles, up from 2.05% in 2021. Furthermore, the inability of 1.9 million Australian homes to obtain off-street parking makes it challenging to charge an EV at home. As a result, the demand for public EV charging stations is on the rise. According to the Electric Vehicle Council, Australia's infrastructure for charging is growing at a notable pace.",677.0,385.0,7.0,8.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.01818181818181818,0.02077922077922078,0.005194805194805195,0.012987012987012988,0.0025974025974025974,-0.0025974025974025974

Veteran investor Ross Gerber revealed on Sunday that his X account was hacked by “sophisticated” cryptocurrency scammers to promote a coin linked to automotive giant Tesla. What Happened: Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, thanked the X team, especially CEO Linda Yaccarino, for the quick resolution. Gerber told Benzinga by mail that the account recovery took 30 minutes. “Considering it was a Tesla crypto scam coin, I was specifically targeted in this attack,” Gerber disclosed. He clarified that he doesn’t promote cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin to his clients. My account was hacked yesterday by very sophisticated crypto scammers. Sorry for any confusion caused by this hack. Twitter/X responded rapidly and was very helpful. Special thanks to @lindayaX for being the best. Gerber, an early investor in the Elon Musk-led giant, has significantly reduced his fund's stake in the company since November and set a six-month ultimatum for Tesla to improve its performance before potentially exiting the stock entirely. “It's possible it was an inside job at X; not sure if they’re investigating it,” Gerber said, voicing doubts about the social media behemoth, which is also controlled by Musk. X didn’t immediately return Benzinga’s request for comment.

He noted that the appointment of crypto-friendly individuals in the Donald Trump administration wouldn’t necessarily protect retail investors from scams.

Vice President JD Vance, who was backed by PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, has voiced his concerns about the influence of big tech companies, asserting that these companies wield “too much power.” What Happened: Speaking on “Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan” on Saturday, Vance was asked about the prominent presence of tech leaders at Donald Trump’s inauguration. This included names like Meta Platforms, Inc.’s META Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon.com, Inc.’s AMZN Jeff Bezos, Tesla Inc.’s TSLA Elon Musk, Apple Inc.’s AAPL Tim Cook, and Alphabet Inc.’s GOOG GOOGL Sundar Pichai. To illustrate his point, the Vice President noted that the tech leaders did not receive preferential seating over his mother or other supporters. “We believe fundamentally that big tech does have too much power.” See Also: Nvidia Stock Slides Overnight On Robinhood As China’s DeepSeek Sparks Doubts Over GPU Spending Frenzy — Chamath Palihapitiya Highlights Report Indicating AI Holy Grail Cracked He stressed the importance of tech companies respecting constitutional rights and halting censorship and cautioned that Trump’s administration would not look kindly on non-compliance. Why It Matters: The tech sector played a crucial role in Trump’s 2024 election victory, with Musk investing significantly in support of Trump and other Republicans. Trump appointed Musk to lead a new agency focused on reducing federal spending. Other tech leaders also engaged with Trump, visiting Mar-a-Lago before the inauguration. Vance has been vocal about his desire to break up large tech companies, particularly Google's parent company Alphabet. Interestingly, the Vice President had a powerful Silicon Valley backer in the share of Thiel who has also funded his 2022 Ohio campaign with $15 million.

Tesla Inc. TSLA executive Wes Morrill said on Saturday that he continues to have “social etiquette” complaints about the company’s full self-driving (FSD) driver assistance technology and is increasingly surprised by its capabilities. What Happened: Morrill said in a post on X that FSD is driving without much of his intervention now. Still, he continues to have social etiquette complaints such as waiting “too long” at a four-way or not accelerating fast enough at the highway on-ramp. “And every once in a while there is a weird situation I think “okay I’m probably going to need to intervene here” and then I’m surprised when FSD just gracefully does the right thing,” Morrill said in a post on X. This what I've been telling people who ask. My remaining complaints are all social etiquette things. Waiting too long at a four-way or not accelerating fast enough at the highway on-ramp. And every once in a while there is a weird situation I think ""okay I'm probably going to… https://t.co/Dg6XtPZ6Ia FSD is an advanced driver assistance system that allows for hands-off driving. While the system provides for automatic lane changes, among other things, it still requires active driver supervision and for the driver to take over in situations where they believe the system cannot perform adequately. Why It Matters: Tesla is optimistic that FSD will enable vehicle autonomy with future versions of the software. However, as of date, it is yet to make vehicles wholly autonomous. “It’s learning, but does still need supervision. Getting longer and longer between interventions,” Morill said in a post-reply about its improvements. Older versions ran over curbs for me, but recent builds I haven't hit a curb even in those same areas. It's learning, but does still need supervision. Getting longer and longer between interventions. However, FSD has also been under the radar of regulators. Earlier this month, U.S. auto safety regulator National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened a probe into about 2.6 million Tesla vehicles equipped with the company’s full self-driving driver assistance technology following a complaint alleging that the use of its “Actually Smart Summon” feature led to a crash. Actually Smart Summon refers to a feature that allows a user to remotely move the vehicle towards themselves or to another nearby location such as a parking lot through the company’s phone app. Check out more of Benzinga's Future Of Mobility coverage by following this link.",436.0,216.0,6.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.027777777777777776,0.023148148148148147,0.013888888888888888,0.013888888888888888,0.004629629629629629,0.004629629629629629

LEMONT, IL — One person is dead after a car crashed near a stream in Lemont early Wednesday, the Will County Sheriff's Office said. A large emergency response was reported early Wednesday off of Archer Avenue, close to Interstate 355 in Lemont. Will County Sheriff's Office spokesperson Kathy Hoffmeyer told Patch the incident happened at 2:11 a.m. on Wednesday. Initially, Lemont Police and Cook County Sheriff's Office responded to single-vehicle crash of a Tesla Model 3, as well as Homer Fire Department. The fire department extricated the 34-year-old driver from the vehicle. The front seat passenger, a 36-year-old man, was pronounced deceased, according to the sheriff's office. The Will County Coroner's Office has identified him as Sameer Gowani, of Lisle. The driver was taken to the hospital in stable condition. The backseat passenger was ejected from the vehicle and airlifted to the hospital in critical condition, Hoffmeyer said. Hoffmeyer said the vehicle was heading eastbound on 135th Street at a high rate of speed, and lost control while maneuvering the curve west of Archer Avenue. ""The vehicle crossed over the double yellow line into oncoming westbound traffic, struck the curb on the north side of the roadway,"" Hoffmeyer said. ""The vehicle then went airborne, touching down in a grassy area near the entrance of the Target store.

Since the Tesla Model S was released, it has wowed worldwide with its giant touchscreen, fast performance, self-driving, and oh-so-much storage (the frunk!). The reality is that owning a Tesla has gone from a fad to mainstream, as the Model Y is now one of the best-selling cars in the world. Key Points The Tesla Model S was the company’s first truly successful automobile. The spartan interior of the vehicle has left customers wanting more. The lack of a large Supercharger network is a big concern. 4 million Americans are set to retire this year. If you want to join them, click here now to see if you’re behind, or ahead. It only takes a minute. (Sponsor) However, just because the Tesla Model Y is a hit doesn’t mean that the Tesla Model S should continue to be your dream car. Along with its hefty price tag, one might want to look at other, perhaps more luxurious, options like the Porsche Taycan, BMW i5, or the Mercedes-Benz EQE instead. 20. Elon Musk There’s no way around it, but the consistent controversies around Elon Musk have led people to surrender their Tesla vehicles, even at a loss. This shouldn’t be a political consideration, but some people believe in protesting with their wallets 19. No Physical Controls Relying solely on the digital display and touchscreen to control your climate settings and radio might seem ideal, but it’s also potentially distracting. While we’d all likely hope to see fewer physical controls on vehicles in the future, Tesla may have taken it too far to fast. 18. Legacy Automakers Are Getting Better When the Tesla Model S launched, it felt like a dream come true as a supercar with lots of range and speed. However, Tesla’s competitors are catching up and, in some ways, surpassing Tesla in terms of overall performance and luxury features. 17. Limited Paint Colors Do you want a yellow or green Tesla Model S? If so, you’re out of luck, as you have only five colors and just two wheels. This is a significant concern with Tesla as the number of options available to personalize your car is very limited. 16. Environmental Concerns The hope is that driving an electric vehicle is better for the environment than a gas engine. However, when you get into the nitty gritty about how electric cars are built, you’ll discover some concerning lithium and cobalt mining issues that border on unethical. 15. No Apple CarPlay or Android Auto There is no question this one is a deal breaker for yours truly, as I can’t live without Apple CarPlay. For reasons unknown, Tesla refuses to include support for both CarPlay and Android Auto, much to the disappointment of Model S owners. 14. Insurance Costs As a result of the high price tag and costly repairs, insuring a Tesla Model S can be more expensive than insuring a gas engine vehicle at the same price tag. Even Tesla’s insurance options are often priced too high for most people. 13. Unpredictable Over-The-Air Updates Yes, it’s fantastic that Tesla can deliver updated features and even improved range to your Model S. However, these software updates often arrive at unpredictable times, making it challenging to know when and why they happen. 12. Disappointing Interior Nowadays, we are trained to expect upgraded interiors in even basic car models. Screen sizes have increased, and standard features have become more impressive, but Tesla likes the bare-bones approach. 11. Range Anxiety Because of the finite number of Tesla Supercharging stations, range anxiety is very real. You must consider this if you own a vehicle and can’t always rely on charging it at home. The idea that you can find a gas station on just about every corner is not at all comforting to electric vehicle owners. 10. Long Charging Times While Tesla has done fantastic work improving the overall charging time on the Tesla Model S, it will still take far longer than gassing up your vehicle. This is a massive concern while on a road trip. 9. Battery Degradation Just as gas engines degrade over time as you start racking up the mileage, so can an EV battery. The problem is that replacing a battery on a Tesla Model S can cost you upward of $20,000 dollars. 8. Depreciation Concerns As much as you might be okay with spending a lot on the Tesla Model S for what it can do, you have to be equally okay with knowing that depreciation might be a shocking surprise when you try to get rid of the vehicle. 7. Limited Service Centers You could be in for a problematic headache if you have an issue with a Tesla Model S and don’t live near one of its service centers. Compare the idea that Tesla only has 207 service centers in the United States, compared to 3,000 for Ford. 6. Family Road Trips We can argue whether a Tesla Model S is a good family vehicle or suitable for road trips, but it’s a moot point until charging stations become as prevalent as gas stations. Just take another car. 5. Software Concerns While it’s great that Tesla likes to add fart noises to its vehicles, relying solely on a digital display for 95% of the functionality of a car is all but begging for issues. Hopefully, these will become more consistent, with greater explanations of what each software update is doing behind the scenes. 4. Build Quality Concerns For better or worse, Tesla has become infamous for questionable build quality, which you don’t want to see on a $70,000-plus vehicle. Whether it’s misaligned panels, poor paint job, or difficulties with an electric component, you want and deserve better quality. 3. The Cost With the “base” model Tesla Model S at $73,490 and the Plaid version at $88,490, you’re definitely in competitive territory. You can find different electric vehicles with more luxury features for a similar price, even if you must sacrifice some range. 2. Cold Weather Concerns If you live in a cold weather climate and plan to drive your Tesla Model S regularly, you have to consider you’re going to lose some range. It has been well documented by current Model S owners that even the regenerative brakes don’t function right when driving in cold weather. 1. Questionable Self-Driving As much as Elon Musk and Tesla’s leadership want to tout Full Self-Driving, the technology is not as ready as they claim. While it sounds fantastic, you must pay close attention to the vehicle, as it has been the source of multiple crashes over the years.

Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Nasdaq Composite Spirals 4% Lower 3:11 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The markets have widened their losses after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell addressed tariffs and their impact on the economy. Chairman Powell warned that tariffs could throw a wrench into the central bank&#8217;s efforts to tame inflation and spur economic growth. The Fed is taking a wait-and-see approach to monetary policy in the meantime. The Nasdaq Composite is spiraling 4% lower, weighed down by a 9% drop in Nvidia (Nasdaq; NVDA) and other Big Tech names on the tariff fallout. All sectors of the economy are lower with the exception of energy, which is up 1% as a group. Here&#8217;s a look at where things stand as of late afternoon trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 847.60 (-2.10%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 713.07 (-4.24%) S&amp;P 500: Down 161.77 (-3%) Gainers in a Sea of Red 12:32 pm by Gerelyn Terzo While the markets are a sea of red, including a 2.1% drop in the Nasdaq Composite, there are some gainers if you dig deep enough. We found a few, including: eBay (Nasdaq: EBAY) is up 2.5% on the day and is inching closer to its 52-week high of approximately $71 per share. The online auction platform could be gaining from a newly announced partnership with Checkout.com for payments. Bitcoin stock MicroStrategy (Nasdaq: MSTR) is tacking on 1.2% today while the bitcoin price continues to hover below the $85,000 level. On its best day, bitcoin serves as an inflationary hedge from the economy, which stands to benefit MSTR stock. Expand Energy (Nasdaq: EXE) is gaining 1.7% as a rising energy sector lifts those boats. Tariff Fallout 10:04 am by Gerelyn Terzo The markets remain under pressure as of mid-morning trading, with the three major stock market averages stuck in a rut. While March retails sales rose a higher than expected 1.4%, the markets are obsessed with Nvidia (Nasdaq; NVDA), which warned that it will take a massive $5.5 billion charge for processor exports to China, giving the markets their &#8216;I told you so&#8217; moment. Magnificent Seven stocks are each down in the ballpark of 2% this morning, including Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL), whose market cap has dipped below the $3 trillion threshold. The markets are under pressure out of the gate despite stronger than anticipated economic data. All three of the major stock market averages are trading in the red, including a 1.7% drop in the Nasdaq Composite, which is being weighed down by Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA). On the flip side, Applied Digital (Nasdaq: APLD) is gaining 5% today, bucking the otherwise downward trend, on the heels of its fiscal Q3 results. Despite missing Wall Street&#8217;s expectations, Applied Digital is benefiting from its roll in data center infrastructure for AI and high-performance computing, two white-hot tech trends. The gold price is rising 2.4% today to $3,319.30 per ounce as investors flock to the inflationary hedge during these times of heightened uncertainty. Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM) is gaining 4% on the day as a beneficiary of the gold rush. The technology sector is being dragged lower by NVDA stock after the company revealed an upcoming $5.5 billion charge related to chip exports to China, igniting trade war selling once again. Nvidia shares are sinking 5.6% today. Most sectors of the economy are down, including a 2.4% decline for technology, while energy stocks are up by 1%. Each of the Magnificent 7 stocks is lower today. Retail sales grew by 1.4% in March, stronger than the expected 1.2% increase and providing yet another sign of a resilient U.S. consumer. Results excluding auto sales also beat economist projections, coming in at 0.5% vs. estimates of 0.3% even in the face of tariff uncertainty targeting the auto sector. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 165.73 (-0.41%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 292.95 (-1.74%) S&amp;P 500: Down 47.89 (-0.90%) Market Movers BofA analysts have reiterated their &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on Nvidia stock, but it&#8217;s doing little to lift sentiment in shares today. The Wall Street firm also lowered their price target on NVDA to $160 from $200 per share, blaming tariff uncertainty. Oppenheimer analysts have begun coverage on new stock Reddit (NYSE: RDDT) with an &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating attached. Piper Sandler likes Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) stock, reiterating its &#8220;overweight&#8221; rating on the EV maker while lowering the price target from $450 to $400 per share.

Live Updates Live Coverage Updates appear automatically as they are published. U.S. to Isolate China 12:53 pm U.S. authorities are preparing to engage in talks with over 70 countries, urging them to block Chinese goods from passing through their territories, according to the WSJ. The U.S. aims to economically &#8220;cut off&#8221; China. This aligns with President Trump&#8217;s recent statement suggesting nations might need to choose between aligning with the U.S. or China. The approach seems to focus on fully isolating China, while China has pledged to stand firm. Technology Stocks Upgrades and Downgrades 11:00 am MSFT (Microsoft) Downgrade Details: BMO Capital reduced price target from $490 to $470, maintains Outperform rating. Reason: Slower growth in Azure&#8217;s legacy cloud business due to weaker economy, leading to reduced Azure growth estimates for next few quarters and FY26. Insight: Experts indicate slowdown in core legacy cloud businesses. BMO suggests lower capex intensity in FY26 could be a positive catalyst for shares. NVDA (Nvidia) Issue: U.S. Government now requires licenses to ship H20/equivalent AI chips to China and arms-embargoed countries. Nvidia announced $5.5B charge in fiscal Q1 for inventory, purchase commitments, and reserves. Impact: Charge suggests high likelihood of H20 restrictions and low chance of future licenses. Q1 GAAP EPS may take a 20% hit, but non-GAAP sales/EPS less affected. Analyst View: BofA calls restriction &#8220;unwelcome but somewhat expected,&#8221; deems risk &#8220;manageable.&#8221; Maintains Buy rating, but lowered price target from $200 to $160. MRVL (Marvell) Downgrade Details: BofA cut price target from $120 to $72, retains Buy rating. Context: Expects Q1 results to beat due to conservative outlooks and tariff-related demand pull-ins. However, tariffs pose risks: Modest tariffs: 4%-6% sales hit, 12%-13% EPS hit. Deeper tariffs: 9% and 12% sales decline in 2025 and 2026, respectively. Reason: Lowered targets across semis coverage due to growing tariff uncertainty. TSLA (Tesla) Downgrade Details: Piper Sandler reduced price target from $450 to $400, maintains Overweight rating. Reason: Q1 deliveries (337,000 units) missed consensus, likely pushing gross margins to multi-year lows. Lack of clarity on Model 2 specs/pricing hinders reliance on new products for growth. Outlook: Short-term bearish due to weak Q1 financials, but &#8220;big picture&#8221; catalysts could drive sharp rallies. Estimates cut to reflect challenging near-term outlook. The semiconductor sector’s woes are hammering tech ETFs, with funds heavy in Nvidia and other chipmakers leading the market’s slide. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), packed with names like Nvidia, AMD, and ASML, cratered over 3.75% after the U.S. tightened export controls on AI chips to China. Nvidia, the ETF’s top holding, warned of a $5.5 billion charge as its H20 processors now require export licenses. The restrictions also hit AMD as the company export controls to apply to MI308 products, resulting in $800 million. Both stocks plunging close to 6% so far today. ASML, a key supplier of chip-making equipment, sank 5.75% after dismal order numbers and tariff warnings. Nasdaq Composite: -1.76% S&amp;P 500: -1.00% Dow Jones Industrial Average: -0.42% Today&#8217;s selling pressure raised the CBOE VIX index 3% after market fear dissipated the past two days.

The movie Limitless (2011) featured Bradley Cooper in his first dramatic starring role as Eddie Morra, a struggling writer who takes an experimental drug that enhances his cognitive abilities. By turning him into a financial trading wizard, the drug propels him into the stratosphere of high finance. As Eddie relishes his luxurious lifestyle and newfound respect and admiration, he becomes addicted to the drug, the money, and the power, despite increasing mental blackouts, unexplained gaps in his memory, and the threat of mobsters seeking to steal the drug from him. While not a primary aspect of the plot, the underlying theme of addiction in multiple forms is reiterated on several levels while the escalation of the cycle and the difficulty in jumping off the carousel is also explored. It becomes a trap for Eddie, since the fear of returning to his previously humble and failing life outweighs the growing memory and mental problems being triggered by the drug. The threats to Eddie’s life by the Russian mob finally shock him into the realization as to how much else he risks by staying on the ever spinning hamster wheel he has created for himself. The fast track grind is unrelenting, and the temptation to remain on it often outweighs more rational concerns for one’s own mental and physical well-being. Just like a drug addiction, the craving for the momentary thrills of making big profits or collecting big paychecks subsumes common sense safeguards and rational behavior. Combating burnout, especially when finances are not the sole motivation, becomes trickier in identifying the causes and devising the solutions. Key Points The fast lane of 8-figure plus sized deals can be seductive and addictive, becoming a continuous cycle that is difficult to leave. Even with the commensurate financial rewards from a successful career managing huge sums, finding personal fulfillment on a deeper level can elude many who stay in the fast lane. A broader definition and discussion of the nature of success can be helpful in dealing with the pressure and mental toll from the challenges of maintaining the hamster wheel.

Maybe It’s Just Wage Slavery In A Gucci Suit.” The inability to leave the fast track grind after building a net worth of $80 million indicates underlying deep seated insecurities and a prospective psychological and emotional burnout and meltdown. Surprisingly, some people who have achieved profound success can lament about how it’s not all it’s cracked up to be. A Reddit fan who is probably in the top 10% of the 1% richest people posted his personal impressions on the emptiness of reaching the pinnacle of the pyramid. His details were as follows: The poster claims his net worth is roughly $80 million. His assets include multiple liquid forms (i.e. stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) as well as private equity. The poster’s business is self-owned, so he has no boss, no Key Performance Indicator (KPI) metric hanging over his head, and no fixed 9-5 office hours. Contrary to his expectations, his success seems to have only migrated him to the same type of obligations and daily grind as when he was an employee. He finds his current situation is giving him the same stress and optimization addictions, albeit with “better wine, fancier vacations, and the illusion of control.” While no longer managing the funds of clients, the poster is now managing his own portfolio, putting him in the role of “CFO of his personal empire”, with added pressures and no other life beyond work. Ironically, he finds that the pursuit of FatFIRE (Financial Independence Retire Early) has left him stuck on the hamster wheel, irrationally paranoid of becoming irrelevant if he jumps off. Redefining Success The first step in ending an addiction to the fast track is to consciously take a step back to reassess priorities and find oneself, which is something more than a job or its title. As one might expect, the range of responses was very broad. A number of the responses thought it was a LARP (Live Action Role Play) hoax, with some accusing the poster of actually being a ChatGPT Bot. Others were incredulous, finding the poster’s complaints to be hysterically funny, and thinking it was a ridiculous attempt at virtual signaling for victimhood amidst his $80 million accumulated wealth. Several unsympathetic respondents shot back with a mix of envy and resentment: “At $80 million, you’re working for your ego.” “Ego grows faster than wealth.” “Narcissists are in a prison of their own making.” “You need a life. Go find one.” “The problem is you.” “Cry me a river.” “If it helps you feel better, you’re already irrelevant.” “You made your business your personality and your identity. We all need something to bring us joy other than our job title.” To be fair to the skeptics, the poster apparently had posted 6 months ago asking for investment advice to allocate monthly savings to set up accounts for his kids. It’s doubtful that someone who legitimately has amassed $80 million net worth would not have professional financial advisors and estate planners under retainer already for such a purpose. That said, the topic is certainly a legitimate one that is not without precedent. There were some constructive critiques and helpful suggestions posted in response that are good food for thought: One respondent suggested a redefinition of success to extend beyond simply one’s self and making money to have consideration for others. Satisfaction can be found in creating a legacy to help one’s family for future generations. Type-A personalities who relish competing with their peers often don’t know how to live any other way, so taking a break to reset and assess priorities can offer some sorely needed respite. One respondent psychoanalyzed the poster as existentially running from death and filling the void with activity. Anxiety is expressed by the inability to say “no” to another board seat, etc. The RE part of FIRE is to retire into something with meaning. Not just quit your job once you’ve got enough cash. A former pro athlete advised that the only way to take the retirement plunge is to consciously take the step and be honest with yourself to help work through the reinvention process. Having a wealthy financial situation that affords one retirement options can include such activities as: Angel Investing, advising, charitable foundation management, as well as diversions, like travel, hobbies, meditation, fitness, and spending quality time with family and friends. From someone who conquered being in a similar predicament: Freedom isn’t absolute &#8211; it’s a spectrum we negotiate, often unconsciously. Unpacking the real you demands deep introspection and a step back from the C-suite treadmill. Unplug, strip away the noise, and rediscover your own voice. The stakes are low &#8211; you can always return to the grind if it calls. For you &#8211; success is the baseline. The real challenge is redefining it on your terms. Step off the track and recalibrate &#8211; the returns will outpace anything you’ve pitched in the boardroom. One respondent who had attained a similar net worth exited and put his holdings into 80/20 (growth/income) funds so he would have the freedom to travel, spend time with family, learn new skills and play video games. Several who lauded the poster’s choice to stay in the grind pointed out these observations: People who think it’s about ego are off-base. We work for our FUTURE SELVES, and our family. Jeff Bezos had to ask himself “What happens on Day 2?” after he retired from Amazon. Fearing Day 2 means the decision has yet to be truly made. It’s easier to decide to DO something than NOT to do something. If Elon quit after making $180 million with PayPal, we would never have Tesla, X, Starlink, SpaceX, or The Boring Company, so there’s nothing wrong with staying in the game when others might have dropped out earlier.

Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Markets Recover 4:05 pm by Gerelyn Terzo Talk about a roller coaster. After spiraling by over 600 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished in the green, while the S&amp;P 500 similarly eked out a modest gain. The Nasdaq Composite finished slightly lower, but far from its worst levels of the day. While recession fears have been stoked now that the economy is officially slowing down, the markets shook it off, perhaps in anticipation of Meta (Nasdaq: META) and Microsoft&#8217;s (Nasdaq: MSFT) earnings this afternoon. Stocks Trim Losses 12:19 pm by Gerelyn Terzo President Trump has attributed the unexpected GDP contraction to the Biden Administration, surmising that economic growth will &#8220;take a while.&#8221; In the meantime, he urges Americans to stay patient as the next economic boom awaits. Stocks have trimmed their losses. NVDA a Sell 12:07 pm by Gerelyn Terzo One Wall Street firm has turned cautious on the AI boom. Seaport Research has reportedly downgraded shares of AI darling Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) to a &#8220;sell&#8221; rating, owing to worries about AI spending from businesses. Analyst Jay Goldberg believes that while Nvidia was a clear winner in the AI mania, the prospects are already built into the stock. Nvidia stock has shaved off 20% of its value year-to-date. The stock market has come off its lows of the day, with the Nasdaq Composite trimming its declines from approximately 3% to 1% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 are down fractionally. Today&#8217;s sell-off was sparked by an economic contraction in Q1, thrusting the possibility of a recession further into the spotlight. Markets Off Worst Levels 10:53 am by Gerelyn Terzo In what is shaping up to be an historic market sell-off, stocks have come off their worst levels of the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has trimmed its losses from over 600 points to about 400 points, while the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 are down by barely 2% each. In addition to the GDP shocker, the markets received more economic data to process from the labor market. Private payrolls rose by 62,000 in April, falling short of Dow Jones expectations for nearly double that growth. March saw a gain of 147,000 private payrolls, making the sting even worse. Companies are placing hiring on hold as they await the full impact of the Trump administration&#8217;s tariffs. Stock Market Drawdown 10:08 am by Gerelyn Terzo According to Goldman Sachs, if the economy were to slip into a recession, the stock market selling would intensify. Goldman Sachs Micro Strategist Vicky Chang warned that unlike past market cycles, this time around, headline risk signals the market bottom, not the economic trough, saying, &#8220;We still think there is significant vulnerability in a recession scenario, even if the worst of the underlying ‘shock’ has passed.&#8221; The economic slowdown is real. The U.S. economy contracted by 0.3% during Q1 2025 after corporate America rushed to receive imports before the tariffs kicked in. According to the Commerce Department, U.S. GDP declined at an annual rate of 0.3%, adjusted for inflation, the worst drop the economy has suffered in in three years. By way of comparison, economists were predicting an economic expansion of 0.4% in the first quarter, a far cry from the results as the tariff wars took hold. Stocks went into freefall mode in response, including a 600-point decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite spiraled by 2.7% and the S&amp;P 5oo lost 2.0%. Every single sector of the economy is trading lower as fears of an economic recession grip the markets. Each of the Magnificent Seven stocks are under pressure, including a steep 6% drop in Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) and declines of close to 4% for Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) and Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN). What a day for Meta Platforms (Nasdaq: META) to be reporting quarterly earnings after the closing bell today.

As one of the most popular electric vehicles on the planet, the Tesla Model 3 needs no introduction. Not only is it one of the most purchased electric vehicles, but it’s also one of the best-selling vehicles overall. Between good looks, range, and a giant infotainment screen, the Tesla Model 3 has won over millions of customers to the electric world. Key Points The Tesla Model 3 is one of the best-selling electric vehicles in the country. Historically, there have been plenty of problems with Model 3 build quality. Full Self Driving has yet to show its promise for Model 3 owners. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Of course, having a large touchscreen alone doesn’t necessarily mean the Tesla Model 3 is worth owning. As with any popular car, the Model 3 has been hit with plenty of concerns and issues over the years, including the unique reputation of company CEO, Elon Musk, which may have you avoiding it for a competitor when you finish reading. 8. Buggy Software The Tesla Model 3 is reliant on the touchscreen. When it works, the idea of a vehicle receiving software updates like a phone or computer is incredible. There is no question that Tesla has set the stage for every vehicle manufacturer to rely on software updates for years to come, as software controls every vehicle function. Software Glitches Matter Even minor software glitches can be a big problem. Whether it’s a frozen screen or rebooting while parked, Tesla has positioned itself as cutting-edge, and sometimes this means aggravation. Suppose you don’t want to worry about this affecting your rearview camera, autopilot, or steering assistance. In that case, you might want to skip a vehicle that is so heavily reliant on improvements through software updates. 7. Image Perception The Tesla Model 3 has a CEO problem. Right now, the image of the Tesla Model 3 is one of danger, as Elon Musk has taken a polarizing position in the Trump Administration. Regardless of your feelings on the administration, there are frequent protests at Tesla dealerships due to Elon Musk being largely behind government job cuts. Can’t Ignore Politics Elon Musk has become increasingly controversial. There should never be a time when politics dictates which vehicle someone drives, but it’s hard to ignore what’s happening in the world. As a result, some people will resist buying a Tesla Model 3 as a form of protest over its CEO&#8217;s controversial public persona. Right or wrong, this is a reason people are not purchasing or selling their existing Model 3 vehicles. 6. Autopilot Cost Full Self Driving works, but isn&#8217;t as good as promised. Tesla and Elon Musk, in particular, have heavily touted using the Autopilot functionality as the Tesla Model 3’s most significant selling point. While this is true for most Tesla models, there are some instances in which Full Self Driving has led to accidents that should give you room to pause. Not Ready Yet The hope is that self-driving will work better in the future. Yes, you can use full self-driving, and, if you want it forever, you need to pay upward of $8,000 or more. This is a crazy high price for a feature that doesn’t come close to delivering on what was initially promised. You can’t let any car drive itself without significant concerns about harming others or other vehicles. 5. Minimalist Interior The Model 3 remains very sparse without buttons. There is no question that the increase in electric car popularity has caused vehicle manufacturers to consider minimizing the number of buttons inside a vehicle&#8217;s interior. Tesla took it to the extreme by limiting the number of buttons to as few as possible. While some buttons are on the steering wheel, most everything happens through the infotainment screen. No More Buttons The Model 3 has almost zero buttons besides the steering wheel. What’s annoying about this is that nearly every critical operation of the Tesla Model 3 takes place on the touchscreen. You must quickly glance at the screen for most operations, which means taking your hands off the wheel. This is opposed to being able to adjust climate control or vehicle sound without leaving the wheel. 4. Range Worries There are concerns with Tesla&#8217;s range. The overall range is one of the biggest reasons I worry about buying a vehicle like the Tesla Model 3. When you factor in how easy it is to gas up a car while on a road trip, you know you can get gas and return in minutes. Unfortunately, unless you buy a Model 3 strictly for driving around town, you must factor in range and charging. Long Charging Times Charging a Tesla can take some time, even with a Supercharger. Yes, you can recharge fairly quickly at a Tesla Supercharger station, but you have to be able to not only find a Supercharger station, but as these stations are still too few and far between, you have to get in line. Given that charging a vehicle can take 20-30 minutes, plus the time you might need to wait to access a charge, range worries are not something to ignore. 3. Cold Weather Performance Model 3&#8217;s lose range in the winter months. If you’re looking to buy an electric vehicle, the Tesla Model 3 will undoubtedly raise questions about how much range it will lose in colder weather. While reports vary, seeing a range drop by 20-30% in frigid weather isn’t something to ignore. Why This Matters Driving a Tesla in cold weather has tradeoffs. If you live in a warm-weather area like Florida or Southern California, you don’t have to worry about too much of a range impact based on cold weather. However, if you live anywhere in the Northern United States, this is a cold-weather staple, and range loss during the winter months may affect your plan, including how frequently you need to charge. 2. Costly Repairs Teslas have costly repairs. Should the time come when your Tesla Model 3 needs to be repaired, whether because of build quality concerns or some other repair need, you should expect high repair costs. Given the complex design of the Model 3, electric vehicles in general, and Tesla’s proprietary parts, sometimes you can see repair costs upward of 20% more than comparable vehicles. Why This Matters Tesla locations are only found in heavily populated areas. Nobody likes surprise expenses, and vehicle repairs can be among the most surprising and the biggest headaches. In other words, between Tesla’s still somewhat sparse repair network and repairs that can take longer than other dealerships, it’s a real pain in the you know what. 1. Build Quality Concerns Build concerns have plagued Tesla for years. Among the biggest reasons, if not the most important, to avoid the Tesla Model 3 is questionable build quality. This has been plaguing Tesla for years, and the company has not been able to address it in a way that has restored confidence in the Model. Why This Matters Tesla&#8217;s build concerns are still present, even years after launch. Build quality matters a great deal when you are spending thousands of dollars on a vehicle. There is a definite reason to skip the Model 3, between thinning paint and misaligned panels. Perhaps worst of all, there is a genuine concern over resale value for those who have purchased the Model 3.

Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Ford in Focus 3:55 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The markets finished the day the way that it started &#8211; lower -putting an end to a multi-day winning streak. Now the markets are gearing up to process quarterly earnings results from Ford (NYSE: F), whose stock fell 1.2% during regular market hours. Automakers have had a target on their backs for tariffs, and the markets will be looking for greater clarity on any impacts in Ford&#8217;s performance. Here&#8217;s how the major indices finished the day: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 69.52 (-0.17%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 132.40 (-0.74%) S&amp;P 500: Down 36.79 (-0.66%) America First Economy 12:38 pm by Gerelyn Terzo U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is speaking at the Milken conference today, addressing global investors about President Trump&#8217;s economic agenda. As part of his America First vision, President Trump is looking to make the U.S. economy more appealing to investors amid a strategy involving tariffs, tax cuts and deregulation &#8211; oh my. While the markets await further details on trade talk progress, the three major stock market averages are mixed, including a slight gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite remain lower. Tariff Uncertainty Remains 11:36 am by Gerelyn Terzo The Dow Jones Industrial Average has turned higher, managing a 7-point gain after starting the session in the red. Meanwhile, technology stocks continue to weigh on the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500. According to TD Cowen, tariff-related price hikes are set to rear their heads in May&#8217;s inflation print. Much of the tariff damage will unfold in the summer months as lower-priced inventories dwindle at businesses. The firm says consumers are between a rock and a hard place as tariff-related costs trickle down to them, a situation exacerbated by higher shipping costs. Selling Eases 10:04 am by Gerelyn Terzo The markets remain under pressure this morning but are off their lowest levels of the session. Netflix (Nasdaq; NFLX) shares are off about 2% on the day after last week&#8217;s rally.

In addition to earnings, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell set to comment on the economy this week, suggesting it could be yet another roller coaster ride for investors. First-quarter earnings season continues to roll on, with names like Palantir Technologies (Nasdaq: PLTR) as well as Ford Motor (NYSE: F) and Diamondback Energy (Nasdaq: FANG) on the docket in the coming days. All three of the major stock market averages are trading in the red out of the gate, including a 1% decline in the Nasdaq Composite. Mag Seven stocks are mixed while the sell-off continues to unfold in Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) shares, with a 2% decline today. All sectors of the economy are currently lower, the most severe of which is happening in energy stocks, which are down 2% this morning as the oil price continues its descent. Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-B) has reached the end of an era now that billionaire Warren Buffett announced his retirement after six decades at the helm. With $300 million in cash on the sidelines, BRK-B is losing 6% on the day for a market cap of $1.09 trillion. Greg Abel will succeed Buffett at year-end 2025.

Stocks are awaiting further details on trade deals, which the White House has revealed could come as soon as this week, which would not be soon enough for the markets. Ford (NYSE: F) stock fell just over 1% on the day ahead of the automaker&#8217;s quarterly results after the closing bell today. When fellow automaker General Motors (NYSE: GM) reported its quarterly results last month, the company withdrew its profit guidance due to tariff uncertainty.

He pointed to a three-pronged approach, including tariffs, tax cuts and deregulation. Bessent&#8217;s remarks failed to provide any greater clarity on the status of tariff negotiations with key U.S. trade partners, leaving the markets at a standstill. The three major stock market averages remain mixed, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average moving higher while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite remain lower.

Zimmer Biomet (NYSE: ZBH) is also down 9%. In what is proving to be a volatile session on Wall Street, the markets have come off their lows of the session. The markets are coming off the heels of a nine-day winning streak and have come out of the gate with plenty of headlines to process, chief among which has been the announced retirement of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-B) CEO Warren Buffett. Wall Street firm TD Cowen has issued a report suggesting that price increases from tariffs will be reflected in May&#8217;s inflation data. The Federal Reserve gathers this week to determine the near-term outlook on interest rates while the markets will also be paying close attention to the tone in comments from Chairman Jerome Powell. First-quarter earnings continues to unfold as names like Palantir Technologies (Nasdaq: PLTR), Ford Motor (NYSE: F) and Diamondback Energy (Nasdaq: FANG) take the spotlight. Mag Seven stocks are a mixed bag as shares of Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) extend their losses with a 2% decline today.

After soaring in 2023 and 2024, shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) were battered throughout Q1 2025. And while the stock performed marginally better in Q2, the largest U.S. EV-maker slid into Q3. However, over the past five days, the stock is up 6.56%, trimming its year-to-date loss to 16.44%. But since hitting its all-time high on Dec. 17, TSLA has fallen nearly 34%. Shareholders are hoping that the launch of Tesla&#8217;s Robotaxi can help the stock, which has seen increased volatility in the wake of abysmal Q1 earnings and an ongoing spat with the Trump administration. Over the past decade, Tesla has suffered incredible losses that have shocked investors who had grown accustomed to the stock&#8217;s rapid appreciation over the past decade. The company&#8217;s meteoric rise has practically minted millionaires who jumped on the Musk bandwagon in the early goings. That&#8217;s certainly a move that&#8217;s come with some baggage and volatility along the way. But overall, it&#8217;s clear that Musk&#8217;s visionary status has rewarded shareholders since Tesla&#8217;s IPO on June 29, 2010. In early July, Goldman Sachs raised its price target on TSLA to $315 from $285, but maintained a &#8220;Neutral&#8221; rating after Tesla reported preliminary Q2 vehicle deliveries of about 384,000, which was down 13% year-over-year. Also in July, Mizuho lowered its price target on Tesla to $375 from $390 citing weakness in North America EV sales and Tesla&#8217;s headwinds in Europe. In late June, Benchmark analyst Mickey Legg raised the firm&#8217;s price target on Tesla to $475 from $350, maintaining its &#8220;Buy&#8221; following the successful launch of Robotaxi. The firm believes the rollout demonstrates &#8220;a controlled and safety-first approach,&#8221; according to the analyst, who argues that winning over regulators and public opinion is &#8220;paramount and will allow a rapid scale up if achieved.&#8221; The company continues to see sales decline in the U.S. and abroad, resulting in a series of downgrades. Also in early June, Guggenheim said the company&#8217;s fundamentals &#8220;continue to deteriorate at an alarming rate,&#8221; with &#8220;soft&#8221; Q2 delivery trends. Guggenheim reiterates a &#8220;Sell&#8221; rating on the shares with a $175 price target. 24/7 Wall St. conducted analysis to provide more clarity. Let&#8217;s dive into whether the recent drop in Tesla’s stock price can be expected to continue, or if this is a top growth name that can rebound to new all-time highs and resume its march higher. Key Points Tesla deliverables are down year-over-year, and it continues facing headwinds in the U.S. and European markets. As CEO Elon Musk’s feud with President Trump continues, the stock has seen heightened volatility.

Key Drivers of Tesla&#8217;s Stock Performance 1. Core EV Business: Tesla&#8217;s most important business line is unsurprisingly the company&#8217;s auto business. With sales of the company&#8217;s EVs down on a year-over-year basis, and margins also declining from historically high levels following the onset of the pandemic, investors will continue to assess the company&#8217;s future prospects in proportion to how the company&#8217;s core revenue and earnings driver is performing. 2. Autonomous Driving (FSD), Robotics and More: Tesla&#8217;s value can be ascribed to what many long-term investors view as a call option on some other key growth categories CEO Elon Musk continues to work on. Aside from the company&#8217;s core electric vehicle offering, Tesla&#8217;s energy business, its FSD platform, humanoid robotics endeavors, AI verticals, and other growth categories make this stock unique in terms of the breadth and number of potential catalysts investors can look to for future growth. Of course, the extent to which these endeavors deliver boosted margins (or increased CapEx) remains to be seen. 3. Macro and Political Environment: Like it or not, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has cozied up to president Trump in a big way. This move is one that&#8217;s been broadly cheered by the overall market, at least out of the gate. Tesla stock soared following Donald Trump&#8217;s election victory, though Tesla has since given up its gains since this pivotal event, and has trended lower for seven straight weeks following the election. We&#8217;ll have to see if the Trump administration brings forward the sort of regulatory environment so many investors had hoped for in 2025 and in the years to come. What Wall Street Thinks Tesla’s stock price outlook for 2025 varies widely among analysts, reflecting uncertainties in production, market conditions, and EV advancements. Analyst price targets span a very wide range, with the most bearish analyst putting forward a $19.05 price target, and the most bullish suggesting this stock could head to $500 per share. Thus, there&#8217;s not really a true idea of where this stock is headed. And when investors think about the fact that many of these analyst projections are outdated, doing the math on where this stock could be headed over the course of the next year isn&#8217;t as easy as it seems. It&#8217;s worth noting that analysts remain largely bullish on the stock, though. However, given how far Tesla has fallen from its peak, even if the company can hit this target over the next year, it&#8217;ll still have a ways to go to make it to a new all-time high. The thing about Tesla and other high-growth stocks is that I find analysts are often chasing the returns these stocks provide. Thus, I think it&#8217;s best for most investors to steer clear of using analyst price targets as anything other than guardrails. Indeed, Tesla is one company I think is worth doing one&#8217;s own DCF analysis on and coming to one&#8217;s own price target. Tesla&#8217;s 2025 Outlook As we move through 2025, analyst opinions on where Tesla could be headed do vary. Overall, Tesla’s stock performance in 2025 is expected to be shaped by production output, market trends and advancements in EV and battery technology. Analysts project a 17.5% revenue increase to $117.2 billion, driven by growing demand and energy sector expansion. Tesla’s 2025 deliveries are forecasted at 1.95 million units by Barclays, below Bloomberg’s consensus of 2.08 million and Tesla’s earlier estimates. Despite a 62.5% stock surge in 2024, an $80 billion market value drop raised concerns. Musk remains optimistic, expecting a 20-30% delivery increase, though management later emphasized a &#8220;return to growth.&#8221; To add, competition from Waymo and declining registrations in Germany, France and California present challenges. Tesla’s push into AI and autonomous driving, including plans for a Robotaxi launch, could be a game-changer, but the company recently saw its share of the EV market slip below 50% in California. To compound matters, the stock is losing favorability among the smart money. Institutional holdings for TSLA are down t0 48.74%. Tesla Stock 2025 Price Target Based on Wall Street analysts&#8217; estimates, the median one-year price target for shares of TSLA is $293.38, which implies 7.43% potential upside from its current price. Of the 35 analysts covering Tesla, the stock currently receives a consensus “Hold” rating, with 13 analysts rating it a &#8220;Buy,&#8221; 13 rating it a &#8220;Hold&#8221; and nine rating it a &#8220;Sell.&#8221; On the other hand, 24/7 Wall St.&#8216;s 12-month price target for Tesla is bullish at $352.99, which represents potential upside of 11.37% from the current share price. Those figures are based on the company seeing projected revenue growth climb from $112.091 billion in 2025 to $297.430 billion in 2030, alongside normalized EPS growth of $2.85 in 2025 to $11.61 in 2030.

While the average price of a car sold in India is $13,000, Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) will sell its Model Y there for about $69,770, according to Reuters. India is the world’s fourth-largest car market. Its annual sales of 4.4 million light vehicles puts it behind China (25.1 million), the United States (15.4 million), and Japan (4.5 million). Clearly, Tesla is aiming at the highest-priced segment in the world’s second-largest nation by population. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) reportedly will sell its Model Y in India for nearly $70,000. It will compete with entrenched high-end brands there and face a charging station challenge. Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) One of Tesla’s major hurdles in India is tariffs of over 100%. If the Trump administration improves those tariff numbers, the price of the Model Y could drop considerably. It would still be expensive by local standards. Tesla aims to compete with high-end brands. These will be, at least, Mercedes and BMW. Since they are entrenched, it is hard to say how difficult it will be to dislodge them. And, they have gasoline-powered engines. Tesla also has to figure out the charging station challenge. Unlike the U.S., India will not have thousands of chargers. Tesla may start to manufacture cars in India. That will help its relationship with the national government, much as it has in China. However, that will not be enough to offset the high price and the need for a national infrastructure of charging stations.

With second-quarter earnings set for Wednesday, Wall Street is watching closely to see whether Elon Musk's energy ambitions can withstand a fresh wave of tariff tensions that threaten to hit the battery segment harder than the EV business.",79.0,45.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.022222222222222223,0.022222222222222223,0.044444444444444446,0.0,0.0,0.0

Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Trading Day Over 4:14 pm by Eric Bleeker At the end of the day, OpenDoor closed up 42.67%. That&#8217;s a mammoth gain for any trading day, yet I&#8217;d imagine plenty of investors were disappointed with the way it ended. Options traders had been making massive bets on OpenDoor to hit $4.50, so there appears to have been some major profit taking with shares trading comfortably above that level in late trading. OpenDoor from trading for $4.88 at 2:40 p.m. ET down to $2.94 at 3:35 p.m. ET. Yet, it is worth noting that shares rallied into the bell and are up another 6.5% after-hours as of 4:18 p.m. ET. One thing is for certain: tomorrow will be another wild ride. Trading resumes 3:17 pm After losing 30% plus in value after a mega trade triggered a pause on the stock, OPEN is back up to $3.95 per share and still up 70% on the day. OPEN stock trading halted 3:12 pm After soaring as high as 115% today OPEN just received a massive sell order that prompted a trading freeze on the stock. Around 3 PM EDT, a 35 million share trade order was received the stock was set to plummet. OpenDoor Now Past 100% Gains Today 1:57 pm by Eric Bleeker OpenDoor is now up 110% on the day. Volume stands at 1.2 billion shares traded, which is 12X more than OpenDoor&#8217;s usual level. We still have two more hours of trading left in the day. OpenDoor Mentions Skyrocketing on WallStreetBets 1:12 pm by Eric Bleeker Since we first published this live blog, mentions of OpenDoor have skyrocketed even higher on WallStreetBets. Third-party tracking site AltIndex now has 263 mentions of OpenDoor, which is higher than second place Tesla&#8217;s 232. Behind those stocks is Alphabet, Robinhood, NVIDIA, UnitedHealth, RocketLab, GameStop, and AST SpaceMobile. OpenDoor Surges To New Highs 1:11 pm by Eric Bleeker As of 1:11 p.m. ET, OpenDoor shares have hit $4.37 and are now up 94% on the day. OpenDoor Tests Daily High of $4.26 12:22 pm by Eric Bleeker OpenDoor reached its high today at 11:35 a.m. when shares hit $4.26. Shortly after that peak fell back to $3.69 at 11:55 a.m. ET. As of 12:22 p.m., the rally ahs resumed and OpenDoor is trading for about $4 per share. The broader market is having a strong day today with the Nasdaq up .65% and the S&amp;P 500 up .56%. Yet, one segment of the market is outperforming everything else: that&#8217;s the new meme stocks. We&#8217;ve come a long way from the rallies in stocks like Gamestop and AMC that dominated 2021, and a crop of new companies has captured retail investors&#8217; attention. The number one stock in focus right now: OpenDoor (Nasdaq: OPEN). OpenDoor&#8217;s rally began after Eric Jackson posted on X that he believed the stock could reach $82 per share. He said: &#8220;Over the last month, my X impressions have exploded talking about $BTQQF $IREN and $CIFR because everyone is looking for the next $CVNA. We think we just found another. @EMJCapital has taken a position in $OPEN — and we believe it could be a 100-bagger over the next few years.&#8221; The price target of $82 was essentially OpenDoor&#8217;s share price at the time, times 100. Very scientific, I know. Yet, Jackson calls himself &#8220;the Carvana hedge fund guy&#8221; and his cheerleading of OpenDoor has attracted plenty of attention. After Carvana&#8217;s 100-fold surge from the bottom, investors are rabdily looking for the next great turnaround story. This live blog will be watching activity in the momentum stocks today with a focus on which stocks are seeing the biggest movements. Momentum Stock Leaderboard Among stocks that have become retail favorites in the current market rally, here&#8217;s a look at some of today&#8217;s biggest movers: OpenDoor: Up 72% as of 12:05 p.m. ET. The company is now worth more than $2 billion. Shares are now up 144% year-to-date, yet many investors buying into the rally are surely lookign at the long-term chart and seeing OpenDoor hit $35 per share back in February 2021. There&#8217;s no specific news on the company today. However, third party data tracking WallStreetBets discussions have OpenDoor passing Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) as the most discussed stock in the past 24 hours. Navitas Semiconductor: Up 30% midday. The company opened the day trading for about $7.44 per share, but has since zoomed higher to $8.75. There doesn&#8217;t appear to be any news related to the company, but Navitas has been a popular stock since they announced a collaboration with NVIDIA on their 800-volt HVDC architecture. Momentum Stocks Dropping Today While OpenDoor and Navitas are surging, a few popualar momentum stocks are having tougher days. Lucid (Nasdaq: LCID) is down 8.8% while QuantumScape (NYSE: QS) is down 14%. If you&#8217;re looking for news on QuantumScape, good luck. It&#8217;s largely all AI-generated slop (womp womp). The reality is there doesn&#8217;t seem to material news. The stock is up 198% in the past month and it&#8217;s likely that some large investor (or investors) is taking profits today. The story is similar for Lucid, the stock has skyrocketed in recent weeks thanks to a partnership with Uber and investors are likely taking profits today rather than any material information impacting the company&#8217;s share price.

After soaring in 2023 and 2024, shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) were battered throughout Q1 2025. And while the stock performed marginally better in Q2, the largest U.S. EV-maker slid into Q3. However, over the past five days, the stock is up 4.28%, trimming its year-to-date loss to 14.03%. But since hitting its all-time high on Dec. 17, TSLA has fallen nearly 32%. Shareholders are hoping that the launch of Tesla&#8217;s Robotaxi can help the stock, which has seen increased volatility in the wake of abysmal Q1 earnings and an ongoing spat with the Trump administration. Over the past decade, Tesla has suffered incredible losses that have shocked investors who had grown accustomed to the stock&#8217;s rapid appreciation over the past decade. The company&#8217;s meteoric rise has practically minted millionaires who jumped on the Musk bandwagon in the early goings. That&#8217;s certainly a move that&#8217;s come with some baggage and volatility along the way. But overall, it&#8217;s clear that Musk&#8217;s visionary status has rewarded shareholders since Tesla&#8217;s IPO on June 29, 2010. 24/7 Wall St. conducted analysis to provide more clarity. Let&#8217;s dive into whether the recent drop in Tesla’s stock price can be expected to continue, or if this is a top growth name that can rebound to new all-time highs and resume its march higher. Key Points Tesla deliverables are down year-over-year, and it continues facing headwinds in the U.S. and European markets. As CEO Elon Musk’s feud with President Trump continues, the stock has seen heightened volatility.

Key Drivers of Tesla&#8217;s Stock Performance 1. Core EV Business: Tesla&#8217;s most important business line is unsurprisingly the company&#8217;s auto business. With sales of the company&#8217;s EVs down on a year-over-year basis, and margins also declining from historically high levels following the onset of the pandemic, investors will continue to assess the company&#8217;s future prospects in proportion to how the company&#8217;s core revenue and earnings driver is performing. 2. Autonomous Driving (FSD), Robotics and More: Tesla&#8217;s value can be ascribed to what many long-term investors view as a call option on some other key growth categories CEO Elon Musk continues to work on. Aside from the company&#8217;s core electric vehicle offering, Tesla&#8217;s energy business, its FSD platform, humanoid robotics endeavors, AI verticals, and other growth categories make this stock unique in terms of the breadth and number of potential catalysts investors can look to for future growth. Of course, the extent to which these endeavors deliver boosted margins (or increased CapEx) remains to be seen. 3. Macro and Political Environment: Like it or not, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has cozied up to president Trump in a big way. This move is one that&#8217;s been broadly cheered by the overall market, at least out of the gate. Tesla stock soared following Donald Trump&#8217;s election victory, though Tesla has since given up its gains since this pivotal event, and has trended lower for seven straight weeks following the election. We&#8217;ll have to see if the Trump administration brings forward the sort of regulatory environment so many investors had hoped for in 2025 and in the years to come. What Wall Street Thinks Tesla’s stock price outlook for 2025 varies widely among analysts, reflecting uncertainties in production, market conditions, and EV advancements. Analyst price targets span a very wide range, with the most bearish analyst putting forward a $19.05 price target, and the most bullish suggesting this stock could head to $500 per share. Thus, there&#8217;s not really a true idea of where this stock is headed. And when investors think about the fact that many of these analyst projections are outdated, doing the math on where this stock could be headed over the course of the next year isn&#8217;t as easy as it seems. It&#8217;s worth noting that analysts remain largely bullish on the stock, though. However, given how far Tesla has fallen from its peak, even if the company can hit this target over the next year, it&#8217;ll still have a ways to go to make it to a new all-time high. The thing about Tesla and other high-growth stocks is that I find analysts are often chasing the returns these stocks provide. Thus, I think it&#8217;s best for most investors to steer clear of using analyst price targets as anything other than guardrails. Indeed, Tesla is one company I think is worth doing one&#8217;s own DCF analysis on and coming to one&#8217;s own price target. In early July, Goldman Sachs raised its price target on TSLA to $315 from $285, but maintained a &#8220;Neutral&#8221; rating after Tesla reported preliminary Q2 vehicle deliveries of about 384,000, which was down 13% year-over-year. Also in July, Mizuho lowered its price target on Tesla to $375 from $390 citing weakness in North America EV sales and Tesla&#8217;s headwinds in Europe. In late June, Benchmark analyst Mickey Legg raised the firm&#8217;s price target on Tesla to $475 from $350, maintaining its &#8220;Buy&#8221; following the successful launch of Robotaxi. The firm believes the rollout demonstrates &#8220;a controlled and safety-first approach,&#8221; according to the analyst, who argues that winning over regulators and public opinion is &#8220;paramount and will allow a rapid scale up if achieved.&#8221; The company continues to see sales decline in the U.S. and abroad, resulting in a series of downgrades. Also in early June, Guggenheim said the company&#8217;s fundamentals &#8220;continue to deteriorate at an alarming rate,&#8221; with &#8220;soft&#8221; Q2 delivery trends. Guggenheim reiterates a &#8220;Sell&#8221; rating on the shares with a $175 price target. Tesla&#8217;s 2025 Outlook As we move through 2025, analyst opinions on where Tesla could be headed do vary. Overall, Tesla’s stock performance in 2025 is expected to be shaped by production output, market trends and advancements in EV and battery technology. Analysts project a 17.5% revenue increase to $117.2 billion, driven by growing demand and energy sector expansion. Tesla’s 2025 deliveries are forecasted at 1.95 million units by Barclays, below Bloomberg’s consensus of 2.08 million and Tesla’s earlier estimates. Despite a 62.5% stock surge in 2024, an $80 billion market value drop raised concerns. Musk remains optimistic, expecting a 20-30% delivery increase, though management later emphasized a &#8220;return to growth.&#8221; To add, competition from Waymo and declining registrations in Germany, France and California present challenges. Tesla’s push into AI and autonomous driving, including plans for a Robotaxi launch, could be a game-changer, but the company recently saw its share of the EV market slip below 50% in California. To compound matters, the stock is losing favorability among the smart money. Institutional holdings for TSLA are down t0 48.74%. Tesla Stock 2025 Price Target Based on Wall Street analysts&#8217; estimates, the median one-year price target for shares of TSLA is $299.52, which implies 8.13% potential upside from its current price. Of the 34 analysts covering Tesla, the stock currently receives a consensus “Hold” rating, with 13 analysts rating it a &#8220;Buy,&#8221; 13 rating it a &#8220;Hold&#8221; and eight rating it a &#8220;Sell.&#8221; On the other hand, 24/7 Wall St.&#8216;s 12-month price target for Tesla is bullish at $352.99, which represents potential upside of 8.25% from the current share price. Those figures are based on the company seeing projected revenue growth climb from $112.091 billion in 2025 to $297.430 billion in 2030, alongside normalized EPS growth of $2.85 in 2025 to $11.61 in 2030.

Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) 2025 hasn’t been a smooth ride. The economy has seen volatility, the market has seen several ups and downs, and investors are scrambling to look for low-risk options to invest their money. There are concerns about the impact of tariffs, and consumer spending is low. Amidst the uncertainty, the only way to invest is to look for low-volatility investment options that can generate steady income. Exchange-traded funds have emerged as one of the top investment options this year. They allow investors to own a collection of stocks with just one investment and at a low cost. I was a die-hard fan of mutual funds, but the returns weren’t satisfactory, which is why I decided to make a switch to ETFs. With thousands of ETFs to choose from, it can become overwhelming, and the industry is getting more crowded. Here are the top 3 I invested in. SPDR Gold Shares Gold has always been considered a hedge against inflation, and the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) ETF is a top choice amid uncertain markets. Launched by State Street Global Advisors, the ETF is traded on exchanges in Hong Kong, Mexico, Japan, and Singapore. It is a trust that purchases, stores, and sells gold bullion, allowing investors to capitalize on rising gold prices. It has a low expense ratio of 0.40% and is the largest gold ETF in the market. Its NAV has soared over 40% in a year and about 12% in five years. The fund launched in 2004 and has kept pace with the S&amp;P 500 over the years. Gold prices will fluctuate in the short term, but the past year has seen a steady upside. Geopolitical tensions and the expanding money supply have lifted the commodity’s value. GLD is a defensive investment, and it brings stability to my portfolio. It is easier for me to pay the annual management fee as compared to buying and storing gold bullion. This ETF has become a centrepiece of my portfolio. Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index ETF A reliable dividend ETF by Vanguard, the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (NYSE: VYM) has a strong history of delivering steady income and capital appreciation. It has an expense ratio of 0.06% and it tracks the performance of FTSE High Dividend Yield Index. VYM has a yield of 2.57% and holds 582 stocks. The sector distribution includes: Financials: 21.50% Industrials: 13.40% Technology: 12.30% Healthcare: 12.10% It holds some of the biggest dividend paying companies in the top 10, including Walmart, AbbVie, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Exxon Mobil. The ETF pays quarterly dividends, and the strong portfolio allows it to remain consistent at it. VYM has generated double-digit annualized market returns with a return of 10.4% in 5 years and 12.4% in the past year. The fund is filled with large-cap stocks that have a stable balance sheet and a record of strong financial performance. Despite market volatility, the fund has remained resilient and outperformed the S&amp;P 500. It offers a safety net and steady dividend income. Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) I believe in the future of tech and wanted to make the most of the sector. Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) allows me to do that. It holds the Magnificent Seven and has a yield of 0.58%. The fund is known for its impressive capital appreciation. QQQ tracks the performance of the Nasdaq 100 index and has the 100 largest companies listed on the stock exchange. It aims for high growth while providing exposure to the best U.S. non-financial companies. It is a tech-focused ETF with over 50% allocation to tech stocks, followed by 19.66% in consumer staples and 5.80% in healthcare. It is top heavy with the 10 holdings making up 51% of the portfolio and these include the Magnificent Seven like Nvidia, Alphabet, Tesla, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Apple. Slightly on the expensive side, QQQ has an NAV of 530.82 and is up 16% in 12 months. The NAV has soared over 100% in the past five years, generating impressive gains for investors. As long as the tech sector continues to expand, QQQ is set to benefit.

New York State Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani's victory in the Democratic primary for the New York City mayoral race is the latest example of the rise of progressive socialist policies in Democrat-led cities. Mamdani is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) and has made socialist policies a cornerstone of his platform, from implementing a rent freeze on rent-controlled apartments to expanding city-owned grocery stores. He has also called for higher taxes on corporations in New York City and an extra 2% flat tax on the wealthiest 1% of New Yorkers, wants the minimum wage to rise to $30 an hour by 2030, said he'll permanently eliminate fares on all city buses and has pledged to ""implement free childcare for every New Yorker aged six weeks to five years."" Another DSA-backed candidate, Minnesota State Sen. Omar Fateh, recently won the Democratic-Farm-Labor Party's nomination for the Minneapolis mayoral race when he defeated incumbent Mayor Jacob Frey in the DFL primary. BILLBOARD ENCOURAGES NEW YORKERS TO 'FLEE' MAMDANI, MOVE TO THIS STATE INSTEAD Fateh has called for creating a local income tax to ""ensure the wealthy pay their fair share,"" as well as creating a ""commercial vacancy tax to address vacant storefronts and a land value tax to incentivize development of underutilized parcels."" He has also proposed increasing the construction of public housing and implementing a rent stabilization policy. GOVERNMENT-FUNDED GROCERY STORE FLOUNDERS IN MIDWEST CITY AS SIMILAR PROPOSAL GAINS STEAM IN NYC Several cities that have elected progressive or socialist mayors have seen large businesses reduce their footprint in the city or relocate their headquarters entirely. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson defeated the Windy City's incumbent mayor, Lori Lightfoot, in 2023 on a progressive platform, but high taxes and public safety issues have become an issue in keeping companies and their employees in the city. REAL ESTATE EXPERT WARNS SOCIALIST MAYORAL CANDIDATE COULD TRIGGER MASSIVE NYC EXODUS The period at the end of Lightfoot's tenure saw Boeing, Caterpillar, Citadel, Guggenheim Partners, TTX and Tyson Foods move their headquarters or significant parts of their operations out of the city.

Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Shares Are Now Green 4:59 pm by Eric Bleeker Shares of Tesla are now green. While growth rates last quarter were poor, that was expected by Wall Street headed into today&#8217;s earnings. The company announcing they&#8217;ve begun preoduction of a more affordable vehicle in the first half is somewhat of a surprise and I&#8217;d expected Wall Street will focus on that in commentary tomorrow. We&#8217;ve already seen one &#8216;bullish&#8217; analyst note from Cantor Fitzgerald today that focuses on the plans for new vehicles being on track, I&#8217;d expect several more. Wall Street Starts Weighing In 4:45 pm by Eric Bleeker Cantor Fitzgerald has issued a research note on Tesla&#8217;s second quarter. They maintain an &#8216;overweight&#8217; rating and were most pleased by the disclosure that new vehicle plans (including a more affordable model) remain on track. Tesla&#039;s Earnings Deck on Robotaxis 4:43 pm by Eric Bleeker &#8220;In June, we launched our Robotaxi service in the first city, Austin, with a safety rider. We will further improve and expand the service (more vehicles covering a larger area, eventually without a safety rider) while testing in other U.S. cities in anticipation of additional launches. Our efforts to refine the Robotaxi offering in Austin are not location-specific and will allow us to scale to other cities quickly with marginal investment. We achieved the world&#8217;s first autonomous delivery to a customer with a new production Model Y driving itself ~30 minutes from the factory across town to its new owner&#8217;s home, including on highways.

The company generated $22.5 billion in total revenue, a 12% decline year-over-year, primarily due to decreased vehicle deliveries and lower average selling prices. Despite these challenges, Tesla achieved a non-GAAP net income of $1.4 billion and a non-GAAP EPS of $0.40, matching the estimated EPS of $0.40. The company launched its first Robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, and plans to expand its autonomous vehicle offerings. Tesla also highlighted the growth of its Energy business, with record energy storage deployments. The company maintains a strong cash position with $36.8 billion in cash and investments, although free cash flow was significantly reduced to $146 million. CEO Elon Musk emphasized the company&#8217;s focus on autonomy, energy, and robotics as key growth areas.

As we await them, keep one thing in mind: the expiration of EV tax credits will make analyzing Q3 deliveries much more difficult. Even with this &#8220;pull forward&#8221; of demand, Wall Street still expects Q4 deliveries to be stronger than Q3. 10 Minute Warning 3:50 pm by Eric Bleeker We are almost to the closing bell. Tesla will be reporting in 10 minutes and we&#8217;ll immediately start posting news and analysis. Once again, simply stay on this page and new updates should appear. It&#039;s About More than EPS Tonight 3:44 pm by Eric Bleeker We previewed the numbers Wall Street expects Tesla to hit earlier. If you missed them, here are consensus expectations: Revenue: $22.1 billion EPS (Normalized): $0.40 Yet, Tesla had an abysmal prior quarter and shares are up 46% since their closing price on the day before the company last issued earnings. Clearly, investors are more interested in developments in areas like Tesla&#8217;s Robotax network and Optimus than they are whether EPS beats or misses by a few pennies in a given quarter. Today, news broke that Tesla was discussing expanding Robotaxi service to Las Vegas. It has been expected that the Bay Area would be a logical next market after Austin. Any commentary from Musk around Robotaxi&#8217;s rollout and expansion plans will likely factor into tomorrow&#8217;s share price reaction a lot more than the EPS and revenue figures Tesla announces for last quarter. Options Markets 3:41 pm by Eric Bleeker Options markets are placing a 50% chance on a move over 8.15% when Tesla reports tonight. Overall, options volume is significantly lighter than recent reports. We&#8217;ll see if this light activity translates to a muted reaction from the market tomorrow. Breaking Before Earnings 3:37 pm by Eric Bleeker A little breaking news before Tesla reports tonight. At 2:45 p.m. ET, Bloomberg published a story that Tesla is in talks with Nevada to expand Robotaxi operations to the state. The Las Vegas area would be Robotaxi&#8217;s second market after launching in Austin, Texas. As you can imagine, investors will be paying extremely close attention to Robotaxi commentary on Tesla&#8217;s conference call tonight. Tesla Shares Flat Headed Into Earnings 3:35 pm by Eric Bleeker We are just 25 minutes from the closing bell and Tesla shares are largely flat on the day. After hitting nearly $336 per share midday, Tesla is now trading for $332 per share, or up .22% on the day. As a reminder, we&#8217;ll be posting live analysis right after earnings are released. Simply stay on this page and new updates will load. We expect earnings to release shortly after 4 p.m. ET. Tesla (Nasdaq:TSLA) reports Q2 2025 earnings after the market closes today. With Wall Street expecting a modest sequential rebound from a disruptive first quarter. Revenue: $22.1 billion EPS (Normalized): $0.40 FY 2025 Revenue: $95.2 FY 2025 EPS: $1.78 After three of the last four quarters delivered negative surprises and stock declines, the key question now is whether Q2 can reset sentiment. Tesla shares fell 6.1% on Q1 results in April, and finished -7.9% lower two weeks later. The pattern has been clear: unless Tesla surprises on margins, product execution, or autonomy traction, investors are unimpressed. Big Question About Deliveries Management has spent recent calls pivoting the discussion toward deliverables. In Q1, CEO Elon Musk confirmed that Tesla would begin production of its new, lower-cost vehicle platform in June, with line validation underway at Giga Texas. This model — a long-awaited lever to scale volume and penetrate new markets — introduces ASP compression risk but could re-energize the equity if early production milestones are met. Right now, Wall Street is expecting 435,000 deliveries in the third quarter. By the fourth quarter, those estimates ramp to 474,000. For perspective, last quarter came in at 384,122. Tesla&#8217;s peak deliveries were Q4 of last year when the company delivered 495,570 automobiles. Non-EV Businesses Investors are also watching for concrete updates on Tesla’s Robotaxi pilot, which Musk claimed would go live in Austin this summer. As of Q1, no commercial regulatory detail had been disclosed, raising credibility questions. CFO Vaibhav Taneja reiterated that Tesla would spend over $10 billion in CapEx this year — including on AI infrastructure, Optimus, and localized manufacturing — and highlighted tariff risk on China-sourced equipment as a rising cost issue. The Energy segment could again be a bright spot. Q1 saw record gross profit, even as deployments fell, and Tesla continues to cite strong Megapack demand. Meanwhile, Services and Other continue to dilute margins, and management acknowledged brand hostility and vandalism as lingering headwinds to volume recovery. Bottomline To trigger a meaningful post-earnings rebound, Tesla likely needs to: Affirm June production start for the low-cost model Show sequential margin recovery in auto Provide visible progress on autonomy or AI monetization Absent that, the recent trend — beat on vision, miss on financials — may keep the stock rangebound.

Elon Musk has quite the career history, manning an assortment of projects, from electrical vehicle building to space rocket launching. And now he adds owning a Los Angeles diner to the list. The Tesla Diner and Drive In, a retro restaurant offering futuristic design and 24-hour service, opened on July 21 in West Hollywood. The 80 charging stalls feature large movie screens, while the popcorn and other menu items are served to customers via robots. The new establishment was highly anticipated and has certainly drawn crowds. However, three-hour wait times and limited menu items have also drawn criticism. And those expecting a decent meal may want to look elsewhere, as visitors say the diner offers high concept entertainment versus a culinary experience. In addition to the above, Musk also bought Twitter for $44 billion back in 2022. Musk funded the acquisition by selling Tesla stock (NASDAQ: TSLA) and taking $13 billion in loans underwritten mostly by Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), and Barclays (NYSE: BCS). About $10 billion came from outside investors, including Qatar&#8217;s sovereign wealth fund. Since then, Musk has ventured into politics, briefly becoming Trump&#8217;s right-hand man, before entering a notorious rivalry with the president and suggesting the formation of a third political party. Throughout it all, Tesla stock has been all over the map, though mostly struggling. This post was updated on August 1, 2025 to include news of Musk&#8217;s Tesla Diner and Drive In. Lender&#8217;s remorse: banks lose Twitter bet After the Twitter (X) acquisition, the Wall Street Journal reported that lenders were struggling to unload the debt they underwrote for the acquisition. They reportedly faced a combined $2 billion in losses. Ebiquity, a London-based market consultancy, said only two of its 70 clients bought ads on the platform during a particular month. This is down from 31 in the same month last year. How does Elon Musk make his money? Bloomberg says $83 billion of Musk&#8217;s wealth is tied to his Tesla stake. About $53 billion comes from his share of SpaceX. Extremely high-value assets like this can be used to cover personal expenses and investments while drawing little or no federally taxable income. For example, ProPublica reported in 2021 Amazon founder Jeff Bezos paid no federal income tax and claimed a $4,000 child tax credit intended for low-income working families. At the time his net worth was $18 billion. How Elon Musk made his money began in 1995 with just $28,000. The $28,000 question The origin of that money is a matter of dispute. According to “Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future,” the 2015 biography of Musk by tech reporter and writer Ashlee Vance, Errol Musk provided his sons Elon and Kimbal with the money they used to establish Global Link Information Network (renamed Zip2 shortly after). Musk denies getting a handout from his father to establish this early online business directory. He says Zip2 was seeded with $2,000 of his own money, $5,000 from Kimbal, and $8,000 from Gregory Kouri, a well-known angel investor who died in 2012. Musk says his father later invested 10% of about $200,000 in a later angel-funding round that &#8220;would&#8217;ve happened anyway.&#8221; Vance stands by his reporting on Musk’s source of Zip2&#8217;s seed money. Amid the peak of the dot-com boom of the late 90s, when tens of billions of dollars of venture capital was flowing into Silicon Valley, Compaq Computer bought Zip2 for more than $300 million in 1999, just months before the internet bubble burst sending tech stocks crashing. Zip2 became part of AltaVista, Compaq’s search engine. Yahoo! shut down AltaVista in 2013. From $22 million to $180 million Musk, who was 27 years old at the time, walked away from the Zip2 sale with $22 million. His brother netted $15 million from the sale. In 1999, Musk plied much of the proceeds from the Zip2 sale into X.com, an early online bank he co-founded with fellow tech-industry entrepreneurs Harris Fricker, Christopher Payne, and Ed Ho. Months later, X.com merged with Confinity, a software company co-founded by German-American entrepreneur Peter Thiel, to become PayPal. In 2002, eBay bought PayPal for $1.5 billion, turning Musk into a centimillionaire with proceeds of about $180 million Musk invested $100 million of this cash to found SpaceX in 2002 and put $70 million into Tesla the following year. Both companies have astronomical valuations which is the foundation of Musk’s immense wealth.

Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Conference Call Is Over 6:10 pm Apple&#8217;s conference call has ended and shares are up 3%. Overall, the company did a lot tonight to push the narrative they&#8217;ll be aggressive to catch up in AI and that device sales are rebounding. It&#8217;s a good quarter for Apple that might start turning around what&#8217;s been a disappointing 2025. Tim Cook on AI 5:58 pm TD Cowen Analst: Tim, I was curious about your thoughts on AI for edge devices. There&#8217;s like some people who think that LLM could be a commodity in the future. Do you think &#8212; do you see a scenario where the LLM become a third part of your iOS or is the SLM the way to go and how to think about evolution of edge devices in a futuristic AI world and is smartphone going to be the choice of device. Just curious your thoughts on it, broadly speaking. Timothy Cook Chief Executive Officer The way that we look at AI is that it&#8217;s 1 of the most profound technologies of our lifetime. And I think it will affect all devices in a significant way what pieces of the chain are commoditized and not commoditized, I wouldn&#8217;t want to to really talk about today. because that gives away some things on our strategy. But I think it&#8217;s a good question. . Tim Cook on Apple Momentum 5:48 pm Here&#8217;s what Tim Cook had to say about Apple&#8217;s surprising momentum in China last quarter: &#8220;Yes. We did grow in Greater China by 4% during the quarter versus the previous quarter, it was driven by an acceleration by iPhone, although we also had substantial growth on the MAC year-over-year. From a &#8212; as you know, the government has placed certain subsidies that affects some of our products, not all of them, but there are some of them. And I think that had some effect. It was the first full quarter of the subsidy playing out. that cut in during a portion of the previous quarter. The other things I would say are that the installed base hit a record high in Greater China &#8212; and we set an all-time record for the iPhone installed base. The iPhone upgraders in Mainland China set a record for the June quarter. And according to Boral Panel, which was formerly known as Kantar, iPhone had the top 3 models in Urban China, which is extraordinary. Also, if you look at the other products, Mac, iPad and watch, the majority of customers that are buying in China Mainland were new to the product. So lots of good things there. And the other thing I would point out, which is an interesting point, The MacBook Air was the top-selling laptop model in all of China, and the Mac Mini was the top-selling desktop model in all of China. So overall, a positive &#8212; very positive quarter.&#8221; Apple&#039;s CFO Says AI Investments Will Rise 5:47 pm &#8220;I would say, a pretty significant driver as Tim talked about, is the fact we are increasing our investment significantly in AI. So that is certainly a component of it. As you know, we&#8217;ve been investing in private cloud compute, which is also in our first-party data centers. The other piece, as you know, is we do have a hybrid strategy where in cases we do use third parties to make capital investments, and we also invest in our own. So you are going to see an increase in CapEx. We also, from time to time, have other investments in facilities in tooling, but I would say a significant portion of the driver of growth that you&#8217;re seeing now is really driven by some of our AI-related investments.&#8221; &#8211; Kevan Parekh, Apple CFO Tariff Implications 5:22 pm On Apple&#8217;s conference call they just said they incurred $800 million in tariff-related costs last quarter.

Late last year, Lucid Group Inc. (NASDAQ: LCID) began production of its highly anticipated Gravity luxury electric SUV. The vehicle was touted for its impressive horsepower and acceleration, and for its long-range capabilities. The SUV was a driver for Lucid&#8217;s strong 2025 sales growth forecast as well. This year, the company announced it would acquire production facilities from bankrupt electric truck maker Nikola, as well as management changes, including the chief executive stepping down and the chief operating officer becoming interim CEO. Actor Timothée Chalamet was named as its first-ever Global Brand Ambassador. And Lucid made a robotaxi deal with Uber, and it has considered a reverse stock split. The first-quarter net loss was smaller than expected, and the company posted its sixth consecutive quarter of record deliveries. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: Lucid Group Inc. (NASDAQ: LCID) is a luxury EV maker with significant backing from the Saudi government. Though offering technology superior to other EV makers, it comes at a higher cost, at a time when the company has cut prices to try to be competitive. However, 24/7 Wall St. sees huge upside for the stock through 2030. If you’re looking for some stocks with huge potential, make sure to grab a free copy of our “The Next NVIDIA” report. It features a software stock we’re confident has 10X potential. Recent news helped the share price rise more than 45% in the past month, before giving up most of that gain. The stock now is 6.9% lower than 90 days ago, well underperforming the broader markets. The stock has been fairly volatile in the past year, with shares trading in a range of $1.93 to $4.43. Luxury electric vehicle maker Lucid was a highly anticipated startup in 2021 when it went public through a reverse merger with the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Churchill Capital IV. Majority-owned by the Saudi government&#8217;s Public Investment Fund (PIF) sovereign wealth fund, the merger attracted $4.5 billion in new capital. The stock quickly ran up from its opening price of $25.24 on July 26, 2021, to an intraday high of $56.70 on Nov. 30, giving it a market cap of $90 billion. It made Lucid more valuable than Ford Motor Co. (NYSE: F). However, more than four years later, Lucid trades for less $3.00 per share, a loss of over 90% of its value. The decline is the result of production issues, sharply falling demand for electric vehicles (EVs), and a sticker price that was far greater than the market would bear. The question is where Lucid stock goes from here. 24/7 Wall St. offers readers insights into our assumptions about the stock’s prospects, what sort of growth we see in the stock for the next several years, and our best estimates for Lucid&#8217;s share price each year through 2030. Lucid’s Performance Lucid has suffered from production issues, weak sales, bloated inventory, and waning demand for EVs The table summarizes performance in share price, revenues, and operating losses from 2021 through 2024, its first years as a public company. Year Share Price Revenue Operating Loss 2021 $38.05 $27,111 ($1,530,446) 2022 $6.83 $608,181 ($2,593,991) 2023 $4.21 $595,271 ($3,099,580) 2024 $2.10 $807,832 ($3,020,820) Share price at year&#8217;s end; revenue and operating loss in millions. Now let’s take a look at Lucid’s production and delivery schedule for each quarter: Produced Delivered Unsold Inventory Q2 2022 1,405 679 726 Q3 2022 2,282 1,398 1,610 Q4 2022 3,493 1,932 3,171 Q1 2023 2,314 1,406 4,079 Q2 2023 2,173 1,404 4,848 Q3 2023 1,550 1,457 4,941 Q4 2023 2,391 1,734 5,598 Q1 2024 1,728 1,967 5,359 Q2 2024 2,110 2,394 5,075 Q3 2024 1,805 2,781 4,099 Q4 2024 3,386 3,099 4,386 Source: Lucid Group SEC filings. In the third quarter, Lucid had operating losses of over $770.5 million, meaning it lost $27,707 for every car it sold. And the more vehicles it makes, the more it loses, with little indication it can turn its operation around. Looked at another way, Lucid lost almost $7.4 million every single day of 2024. Lucid’s grandiose plans to produce 49,000 EVs by 2023 and half a million by 2025 quickly fell apart. As of the end of the first quarter, it had delivered only 21,351 EVs to customers so far. Three Key Drivers of Lucid’s Stock Performance Saudi backing, price cuts, and technological superiority. Building the Saudi Arabian auto industry. The Saudi government is seeking to diversify away from its reliance upon oil for its revenue. It wants to create an auto industry from the ground up and Lucid is the vehicle it is using to develop it. The sovereign wealth fund is willing to invest heavily into the money-losing operation, having provided the EV maker with nearly $8 billion in funding. Cutting prices. Lucid initiated a series of price cuts to keep pace with the rest of the EV industry amid waning demand, making them more competitive with Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA). EV technological superiority. Lucid got its start as a maker of electric drivetrains that it wanted to sell to other EV manufacturers, but changed direction to make the entire car. Its vehicles offer superior performance and range than Tesla, though at a significantly higher cost. Yet as it cut prices to remain competitive, performance declined to become just par with comparable Tesla. Lucid Stock Forecast Through 2030 Analyst sentiment is mixed. Fifteen analysts covering Lucid Group have a 12-month consensus price target of $2.67 per share. That implies 12.7% upside from where it currently trades, and targets range from a low of $1 per share (or 57.8% downside) to a high of $7 per share (195.4% upside). Wall Street, on average, has a Hold rating on the stock. Valuing Lucid&#8217;s stock price for the coming years, beginning with forecast revenue of $1.08 billion for 2025, which represents 39% growth year over year. As Lucid has cut prices to spur demand, sales have grown, but it still has substantial unsold inventory. It makes it questionable how many new cars dealers will accept. We shall assign Lucid stock a price-to-sales ratio of 5x as the market continues to assign a higher multiple to the automaker, which puts our price target at $3.44 per share. Going into 2026, we estimate the price to be $4.77 per share despite weak sales growth of just 5% to $1.134 billion and a P/S ratio of 2.3, which puts it closer to its peers. Yet, the new Gravity SUV, which starts at $81,400 for the Touring model and $96,400 for the Grand Touring model, suggests Lucid will find a very small, niche market for its EVs. Particularly because they will not be eligible for any federal tax credits, it could kill off demand. There is also the question whether the Private Investment Fund eventually tires of pouring billions of dollars into an enterprise continuously losing billions. The EV maker&#8217;s cash burn is some $3 billion a year. Despite the fund&#8217;s desire to jumpstart a new auto industry and using Lucid Group to help its workforce develop the necessary skills, further financing could dry up. Assuming Lucid continues to increase in sales, 24/7 Wall St. sees the share price reaching $7.84 by the end of 2030. That represents upside potential of over 284% for the stock by the conclusion of the decade. Here is a look at how it gets there: Year Price Target Upside Potential 2025 $3.44 45.1% 2026 $4.27 80.2% 2027 $5.11 115.6% 2028 $5.93 150.2% 2029 $6.82 187.8% 2030 $7.84 230.8% Can Lucid Stock Make You a Millionaire?

Markets were doing well until the latest tariffs and a slowdown in jobs created uncertainty. Non-farm payrolls came in at 73,000 with prior months revised lower. With the latest numbers, investors are digesting what it could mean for interest rates. At the moment, investors are betting on reduced chances for a September cut. Unfortunately, the probability of a September fell to 40%, according to the CME FedWatch tool. With tariffs, Trump signed an executive order that modified reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries, with updated duties ranging from 10% to 41%. It’s why the Dow dropped 542 points on Friday, why the S&amp;P 500 shed 101, and why the NASDAQ lost 472 points. This morning, in an attempt to brush off the negativity, the major indices are exploding in the pre-market. The Dow Jones is up about 192. The S&amp;P 500 is up about 35, as the NASDAQ tacks on about 174 points. It’ll be interesting to see if they can hold the gains – especially with the latest tariffs, the potential for a worsening trade war, and jobs.

Through the first seven months of the year, F-Series sales were 39% of Ford Motor Co.’s (NYSE: F) total U.S. sales. That shows how much the company depends on its full-size pickups. Most of these are the F-150, which has been the bestselling vehicle in the United States for almost five decades. It also shows the extent to which Ford has a challenge to diversify away from gasoline-powered cars, which make up nearly all its profits. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: The F-Series remains a significant part of Ford Motor Co.’s (NYSE: F) total U.S. sales. The F-150 has been the bestselling vehicle in America for decades. Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) Sales of the F-150 yield $10,000 in profits each, an indication of how much it contributes to Ford’s bottom line. One question Ford has to face financially is, if it moves successfully into electric vehicles (EVs), what happens to its profits? Will sales of its electric F-150 Lightning cannibalize sales of the gasoline-powered version? Ford objects to the math, but it loses about $100,000 on each EV it sells. A rotation from conventional models to EVs could cost the automaker hundreds of millions of dollars. CEO Jim Farley said recently that U.S. car companies cannot match the quality and prices of Chinese EVs. He says Ford will have a “Model T” moment on August 11. This implies that the company will relaunch its EV initiative after spending nearly $30 billion on the first wave—and losing it. Farley could point out that the first investment is a foundation for a new one. If this so-called Model-T moment is largely to start a new generation of what could be a decades-long transformation of the company, where will the money come from? He has complained about what the new United Auto Workers contract will cost Ford. He has also acknowledged the loss that the company has to take in the EV market. Recently, he added that tariffs will undermine the company’s bottom line further. At the core of Ford’s financials are its warranty costs, which do not seem to be going away. The F-150 is the foundation of Ford’s financial success. What happens when that is no longer true?

Many tech billionaires have lost wealth in 2025 because the share prices in the companies they own mostly remain underwater. As an example, Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock is down 2% this year, while the S&amp;P 500 is up 6%. That hurts Jeff Bezos’ net worth. Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) is down 25%, which undermines Elon Musk’s net worth. One “billionaire” stock is up. Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT) trades 9% above where it was at the start of the year. And the net worth of the Walton family has risen with it. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: Among the richest people in the world, only the Walton family has become wealthier this year. Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT) stock is up sharply year to date. Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) Of the 15 richest people in the world according to the Bloomberg Billionaire list, only the Walton family has posted a large increase in their wealth. Jim, Rob, and Alice have each had a gain of about $300 million. They are the children of Walmart founder Sam Walton. Walmart is currently the largest retailer in the world (China might be an exception). Walmart has done several things to cement its position as a retailer. It says it has passed some of the price of tariffs on to customers. This should preserve margins. J.P. Morgan recently said Walmart should be highly successful this year. The pricing power advantage was among the reasons. Walmart has also made gains in the artificial intelligence (AI) part of retail. Walmart hired Instacart executive Daniel Danker to run its growing AI business. He will oversee “AI transformation and lead all product management and design across the enterprise.” It has added “super agents” to help online customers. Yahoo reports, “According to the retailer, the four agents powered by agentic AI are designed for Walmart shoppers, store employees, suppliers and sellers, and software developers.” In May, Walmart posted its earnings. Revenue rose 2.5% year over year to $165.6 billion, while adjusted earnings increased 1.7% to $0.61 per share. The Walton family has another distinction. Among the people at the top of the Bloomberg rich list, they are the only ones who inherited their money.
