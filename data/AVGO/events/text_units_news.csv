IRVINE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Movandi, a leader in new 5G millimeter wave (mmWave) technology and RF systems solutions, today announced William (Bill) Ruehle has joined as its chief financial officer (CFO). Ruehle brings more than 40 years of experience driving strategy and business performance at both public and private companies as well as scaling high-growth revenue and leading successful companies to IPO, most notably Broadcom from 1997-2006. “With Bill’s extensive background spanning both semiconductor and system technology for numerous fast-growing companies, Bill is an ideal fit for Movandi as we further solidify our position as the leader in 5G,” said Maryam Rofougaran, CEO and co-founder of Movandi. “Bill is one of the most experienced and seasoned CFOs in the tech industry and has taken companies to IPO and grown them to become much bigger global companies. I couldn't be more pleased to work with Bill again and welcome him to our leadership team.” As a CFO, Ruehle has led two very successful IPOs and many acquisitions in the tech sector. Ruehle joined Broadcom Corporation (NASDAQ: AVGO) in 1997 and managed their successful IPO and hyper revenue growth. When he left Broadcom in 2006, the company was the leader in wireless communications semiconductors with revenues of $3.6 billion and a market cap in excess of $20 billion. Prior to Broadcom, in 1987 he was the CFO of SynOptics Communications, Inc. and led their IPO in 1988 and the merger with Wellfleet in 1994 that created Bay Networks. In his 9 years there he helped drive the revenue growth from $2 million to $2 billion. “I am honored to be named the next CFO of Movandi and appreciate the confidence that Maryam, Reza and the Board have in me,” said Ruehle. “Movandi is an incredible Company. This is the second time I have the opportunity to work with what I believe are the most innovative and performance driven teams in the world, who hold almost 1,000 patents between them. I was first introduced to Maryam and Reza when I acquired their company Innovent while at Broadcom in 2000 and watched them grow Broadcom’s wireless business to over a billion dollars and shipping billions of radios per year. They have been at the forefront of wireless innovation for decades and I look forward to helping them scale the Company as it enters its fast growth stage on a global basis going forward.” Ruehle has been serving as the CFO of Bitvore, an early stage SaaS company applying AI technology to the financial services industry. Previously, he was CFO of ClariPhy Communications and completed a successful exit as a sale to Inphi Corporation in 2016. Ruehle was invited to join the Board of Directors of Inphi in March 2017 and is still a member. Ruehle holds a BA in Economics from Allegheny College and an MBA from Harvard Business School. About Movandi Movandi is the fastest growing 5G mmWave solutions company with a mission to revolutionize 5G Everywhere. The company was founded by two siblings, Maryam and Reza Rofougaran, today’s top leaders in the wireless industry, whose innovations have shaped and transformed wireless in the last few decades. Movandi is solving real-world 5G mmWave deployments with unmatched differentiation and high-performance core technology in 5G integrated circuits, antennas, systems, algorithms and design disciplines to enable 5G to reach its full potential.

MCLEAN, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--fibeReality, LLC announced in a newly published study that recent, corporate-wide reorganization efforts by Lumentum looks like an admission of the company’s inability and/or unwillingness to efficiently run its internal factories and fabs. Risk of Lumentum Applying 3D Sensing Business Model Across Firm says that given the great success the vendor has achieved with its 3DS products through its virtual vertical integration efforts, the supplier will slowly strive to transition its other businesses toward a greater amount of outsourcing. “Lumentum’s strategy, beyond staying ahead of its principal competitor, II-VI, on technology, such as its lead with LiDAR chips, is to continue to make up for its lack of complete control by excelling with both its operations team and its contract manufacturing partners to provide differentiated benefits,” said Mark Lutkowitz, Principal at fibeReality. “Supporters of Lumentum can take solace in the vendor not making unilateral, major changes overnight. In fairness, optics is as tough as ever as a business with problems needing to be faced and met with difficult decisions.” The report offers worldwide projections for both 3DS and datacom VCSEL chips. It also provides a discussion of the negotiating tactics as well as the support expectations by the primary customer, Apple. Additionally, the study delivers the following eight items: 1) a competitive analysis of the major VCSEL suppliers, 2) an evaluation of the principal emerging 3DS applications, 3) an assessment of the likelihood of Apple producing its own VCSEL chips, 4) an appraisal on the chances of silicon photonics becoming a true threat, 5) a determination of the odds of VCSELs making a difference with co-packaged optics, 6) a prognostication on the arrival of long-wavelength VCSELs including with singlemode fiber, 7) an outlook for development efforts on multi-junction VCSELs as well as on the maturity rates of PAM4-based VCSELs by speed, and 8) an examination of the potential merger of 3DS and datacom VCSEL markets.

The dividend growth coverage ratio, which compares earnings growth to dividend growth, can help determine a company's ability to sustain dividend growth in the long run."

Closed-end funds, or CEFs, are generally characterized by higher volatility and deeper draw-downs than the broader market. For these reasons, they are not suited for everyone. In this monthly series, we highlight five CEFs with solid track records that pay high distributions and offer ""excess"" discounts. We try to separate the wheat from the chaff using our filtering process to select just five CEFs every month from around 500 closed-end funds."

Much of Broadcom Inc.'s rally this year has been buoyed by market confidence in its competitive advantage in custom ASICs and networking solutions, which are critical in AI infrastructure. But the stock's post-earnings pullback reflects concerns pertaining to the uncertain recovery timeline for Broadcom's non-AI segments, which still account for the bulk of its business. The infrastructure software segment also faces impending risks of maturation, which limits margin expansion and cash flow improvement needed to address the elevated debt exposure acquired from VMware."

In the high-tech universe, there is a single common road that top-flight companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), and many others must travel to get their chips made, no matter where they hail from. That road inevitably leads to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (NYSE: TSM), the largest semiconductor foundry on the planet. When a company like Nvidia designs a new chip, it takes it to Taiwan Semiconductor to actually print the design on a silicon wafer. Taiwan Semiconductor is the top choice for Nvidia, AMD, and many other chip designers, thanks to its precision, quality control, and innovative technical capabilities. At the time of this writing, Taiwan Semiconductor commands over 60% of global spending at chip foundries. The explosion of growth in the artificial intelligence and data center arenas have led to a commensurate demand acceleration for Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) chips and a panoply of similar ones for those fields. By focusing on precision foundry work, Taiwan Semiconductor has become the premier “go-to” player, for chip designers, even among those competing in various sectors. Headwinds and Challenges Taiwan Semiconductor’s biggest threat is from a mainland China invasion of Taiwan, rather than from any market competitors. Despite its crucial place in the semiconductor supply chain, Taiwan Semiconductor is based in Taiwan. Due to claims by The People’s Republic of China’s leadership that Taiwan is a part of China proper, the nation is in a state of perpetual invasion alert. Any overt military action on Taiwanese soil could result in a domino-effect of chip shortages if Taiwan Semiconductor is forced to halt production. Taiwan Semiconductor announced a rise in prices for its 3-nanometer and 5-nm process products by up to 8%. However, Samsung is focusing on its 2-nm process to meet future technologies’ high-performance, low-power, and high-bandwidth requirements, and rival Intel has a 1.4-nm ultra-fine process slated to be unveiled in 2027. The semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical. While AI investment soars, Taiwan Semiconductor has few rivals of significance. During slow periods, semiconductor companies have often been glutted with excess inventory. It remains to be seen how TSM will handle a slowdown after ramping up production to such a high level. Nevertheless, investors are much more concerned with future stock performance over the next 1, 5, to 10 years. Although most Wall Street analysts will calculate 12-month forward projections, it’s clear that nobody has a consistent crystal ball, and plenty of unforeseen circumstances can render even near term prognostications irrelevant. 24/7 Wall Street aims to present some farther looking insights based on Taiwan Semiconductor’s own numbers, along with business and market development information that may be of help to our readers’ own research. Key Points In This Article: Taiwan Semiconductor has control of roughly 62% of the global chip market. For Taiwan, its semiconductor dominance is a good thing, from a national security perspective. Geopolitical observers frequently refer to Taiwan’s semiconductor industry as a “silicon shield” by serving as an incentive for the international community to keep Taiwan out of Beijing’s control. Taiwan Semiconductor’s focus on fabrication precision and its R&amp;D emphasis on miniaturization and efficiency are the main drivers for its huge market share from Nvidia, AMD, Apple, and other chip designers. Aware of its vulnerability to geopolitical destabilization from China, Taiwan Semiconductor has strategically diversified some geographical manufacturing with new US factories in Arizona and Washington, one in Dresden, Germany, and JVs with Sony and Denso in Japan. Apple is hugely dependent on Taiwan Semiconductor, and has been since 2014. Apple announced a deal in 2023 to buy 100% of the output of the most advanced chips from Taiwan Semiconductor in Taiwan (and from its AZ plant in 2024). This move guaranteed that none of Apple’s competitors could acquire similar chips for more than a year.

Taiwan Semiconductor News and Updates 12/9/2024 Taiwan Semiconductor’s stock price declined slightly today, trading as low as $199.16. The stock traded lower than its previous closing price, with a significantly lower than average trading volume. 12/6/2024 Nvidia’s stock price experienced a slight decline of 0.4% to $144.48 in early Friday trading. However, for the week, the stock has seen a 4.8% increase. 12/5/2024 Tawaian Semiconductor may soon be making Nvidia’s powerful new Blackwell AI chips. Production on the chips could begin as early as next year at TSMC’s new factory in Arizona, which is currently under construction. Currently, the chips are manufactured in Taiwan at TSMC’s main plants. However, while the initial stages of production can occur in Arizona, the chips would still need to be shipped back to Taiwan for final packaging. 11/27/2024 Taiwan Semiconducter’s large investment in U.S. manufacturing was a strategic move to diversify its operations and address geopolitical tensions. However, experts suggest that the advanced chip production capabilities in the U.S. may lag behind those in Taiwan for some time. 11/26/2024 Taiwan Semiconductor experienced a slight decline of 0.1% in its share price today, trading as low as $183.87. 11/25/2024 Advanced Micro Devices is looking to break into the smartphone market by teaming up with Tawain Semiconductor. Advanced Micro Devices will utilize cutting-edge APUs built on Tawain Semiconductor’s 3nm process. 11/22/2024 Taiwan Semiconductor’s stock decreased 0.1% today, trading as low as $190.17. 11/21/2024 Taiwan Semiconductor’s share price decreased 0.4% today, trading as low as $186.74. 11/20/2024 Taiwan Semiconductor’s share price declined by 2% today, trading between $184.06 and $185.88. 11/19/2024 Taiwan Semiconductor saw a 0.8% increase in its stock price today. This increase follows Barclays recently raised price target for the company, an increase from $215 to $240 while maintaining an “Overweight” rating. 5 to 10 Year Review Apple Computer procures nearly 100% of its CPUs and other chips from Taiwan Semiconductor. 2014 was the year that the TSM-Apple cooperation began in earnest, with Apple’s A8 and A8X SoCss. Such has the cooperation expanded that Apple has gone to TSM for nearly 100% of its chip requirements by 2024. Opposing patent infringement lawsuits with GlobalFoundries in 2019 eventually settled with a cross-licensing agreement, which ends in 2029. 2020 saw Taiwan Semiconductor prudently decide to diversify its manufacturing by opening up new plants in Phoenix, AZ, and Dresden, Germany. In July 2020, TSM signed a 20-year deal with Ørsted to buy the entire production of two offshore wind farms under development off Taiwan’s west coast. At the time of its signing, it was the world’s largest corporate green energy order ever made. 2021 saw TSM form joint ventures with Sony and Denso in Japan.

Taiwan Semiconductor expects its 2024 capital expenditure budget to hit $32 billion. 70% to 80% of the budget will be allocated to advanced process technologies, 20% will be directed to specialty technologies, and 10% will be spent on advanced packaging, testing, and mass-making. The Company’s revenue growth should continue to accelerate due to its leading-edge N3 manufacturing node. Taiwan Semiconductor plans to commence its 2-nm process in 2025. Strong demand for chips used in artificial intelligence and cloud storage data center applications from Nvidia, AMD, and others shows no sign of curtailing. Thanks to its uniquely advanced manufacturing capabilities, Taiwan Semiconductor can easily scale for demand acceleration, and holds close to a near monopoly on large GPU chip contracts from major semiconductor designers for AI and data center use, even among competing designers. Total spending on AI chip content and related systems is forecast to reach $193.3 billion in 2027, according to estimates from IDC. That’s up from $117.5 billion this year, translating into an 18% compound annual growth rate over the next three years. Taiwan Semiconductor has national interest and support from the Taiwanese government in maintaining its wide competitive advantage, as the tech industry’s dependence on TSM-made chips incentivizes the international community to keep a China invasion in check. Stock Price Prediction for 2025 The consensus rating for Taiwan Semiconductor from over a dozen Wall Street analysts is “buy”(11 buy, 4 outperform,1 hold). The average price target in 12 months is $210.79, which is roughly 5.82% above the current price. 24/7 Wall Street’s 12-month projection for Taiwan Semiconductors’ price is $183.92, which is -7.67% below the current price. While Taiwan Semiconductor will start its 2-nm process in 2025, Samsung has a vested interest in developing its own niche advantage and support from the Korean government in that space. As a result, we don’t anticipate as big of a 2025 surge from 2-nm as other analysts might. Taiwan Semiconductor’s Next 5 Years’ Outlook Since Taiwan Semiconductor consumes as much as 5% of Taiwan’s entire energy output, its Ørsted wind farm energy production should manifest tangible cost savings benefits. Therefore, we project 2026’s stock price to hit $186.00, a modest .74% year-over-year gain. While its 2-nm process will likely compete favorably at the start against Samsung, the TSM competitive advantage in other avenues of chip manufacturing will ultimately prove to be overwhelming. The anticipated surge of data center spending on chips should fuel larger contracts. Collaborations with research institutions and tech giants in developing next-generation AI chips could open new revenue streams and strengthen its position as an innovation leader in the industry. Our projection for 2027 is $206.80. 2028 should begin to see the rewards from the 2024 R&amp;D surge of $32 billion in advanced process technologies. New products from TSM investments in quantum computing research are expected to bear fruit by 2028, potentially revolutionizing certain computing applications. The company’s focus on developing ultra-low power consumption chips for IoT and edge computing devices could position it as a key player in the growing market for energy-efficient technologies. The 2028 24/7 Wall Street price target is $213.90. 2029 will mark the expiration of Taiwan Semiconductor’s GlobalFoundries cross-licensing agreement, which should double up the revenues from that stream. Further developments in chips for quantum computing, healthcare and other applications can open up more direct government contract opportunities. US and German TSM factories should be operating at full capacity by 2029. We anticipate a price jump to $245.99. Taiwan Semiconductor Stock in 2030 TSM’s work in quantum computing should pave the way for neuromorphic computing chips that can mimic many human brain functions. By 2030, Taiwan Semiconductor’s work in quantum computing should pave the way for neuromorphic computing chips at the forefront of AI applications. These would mimic human brain functions more closely than ever before. The company’s involvement in space exploration projects and renewable energy initiatives may also diversify its revenue streams and enhance its global technological influence. We expect a $254.59 stock price, representing a 27.81% gain over today’s stock price.

The explosive demand for semiconductors and microchips has grabbed news headlines and led the market higher over the past few years. As the drive towards integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into our everyday lives progresses, there are a handful of mega-cap companies that are capable of meeting that demand. And as much NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) may get the lion’s share of attention, it is companies like Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO) that will also be playing a central role in supply. The San Jose, Calif.-based company, which was founded in 1961, has been a major player in the tech space for decades. But its business sectors focusing on semiconductors and infrastructure software products have been major catalysts in its market cap pushing toward $1 trillion market capitalization — good for a top 15 among all publicly traded companies. Despite shares of Broadcom gaining over 696.15% in the past five years and 53.25% in 2024, 24/7 Wall Street has performed an analysis that suggests there is still a big-time upside for Broadcom before the end of the decade. Here is where prospective investors and current shareholders might expect the stock to be over the course of the next five years. Key Points in This Article: Broadcom’s history of stellar earnings and strong revenue generation suggests the ability of the company to remain one of the most appealing semiconductor and software stocks. With the burgeoning AI trend and a recent stock split, Broadcom is increasingly appealing and more accessible to investors.

This report breaks down AI stocks with 10x potential and will give you a huge leg up on profiting from this massive sea change. Recent Broadcom News and Updates 12/9/2024 Broadcom is set to report its fiscal fourth-quarter 2024 earnings this Thursday. Analysts are anticipating strong results from the company. JP Morgan analyst Harlan Sur remains bullish, maintaining an “Overweight” rating with a $210 price target. Sur also forecasts that Broadcom’s revenue and earnings will surpass both JP Morgan’s and consensus estimates. The firm expects revenue to range between $14.2 billion and $14.3 billion and an adjusted EPS of $1.40. 12/6/2024 Broadcom is returning 1,500 of its 2,000 largest customers to channel partners. The company hopes this will ensure partners offer better deals to customers and prevent further customer losses to VMware. 12/5/2024 Broadcom recently revealed its 3.5D XDSiP platform, a major breakthrough in chip technology. The new platform is specifically tailored to meet the soaring demand for computational power in AI by integrating a massive 6000 mm² of silicon and up to 12 HBM stacks into a single package. This translates to increased computational power, reduced latency, lower power consumption, a smaller footprint, faster time-to-market, and better support for diverse AI workloads. 12/3/2024 Broadcom shares had a slight uptick today, rising 0.4% and reaching a high of $168.20. 11/27/2024 Samsung and Broadcom have reached a settlement in the antitrust lawsuit filed by Samsung against Broadcom. The lawsuit alleged that Broadcom engaged in anticompetitive practices by tying the sale of certain components to the purchase of others, effectively preventing Samsung from switching to alternative suppliers. 11/26/2024 Broadcom saw a modest increase of 0.6% in its share price today, reaching a high of $166.37. Trading volume was much lower than average, however, with only 4.4 million shares exchanging hands (an 85% decrease from the usual daily volume). 11/22/2024 Broadcom’s stock price decreased 0.8% today, trading as low as $162.42. 11/21/2024 Broadcom’s stock price increased 0.2% today, trading as high as $166.34. 11/19/2024 Broadcom investors are eagerly awaiting Nvidia’s upcoming earnings report tomorrow, as it is poised to significantly impact the broader market, particularly companies like Broadcom, which supplies crucial components for Nvidia’s AI operations. A strong earnings report from Nvidia could boost investor confidence in AI growth and Broadcom’s stocks, as seen on several previous occasions. 11/18/2024 Broadcom experienced a small decline of 0.1% today, trading as low as $162.22. Trading volume was also much lower than average, with only 2,960,294 shares changing hands, a 90% decrease from the usual daily volume. Broadcom’s Recent Stock Success Broadcom’s incredible growth has been reflected in the price of its shares, which have surged since 2014 to the tune of a 3,170% gain. This culminated on July 15, 2024, when the company announced a 10-for-1 stock split that made its shares more accessible to all investors by driving the stock’s price down to $167 at the time. Beyond its role in AI and semiconductors, Broadcom is also a major supplier for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), providing the Magnificent Seven mainstay with critical wireless connectivity components and other hardware. According to the company, Broadcom expects 20% growth in wireless revenue just in the final quarter of 2024. Between its semiconductor, software and smartphone business segments, the stock has experienced sizable growth in the recent past: INSERT TABLE HERE Year Share Price* Revenue** Net Income** 2014 $10.06 $4.244 $1.343 2015 $14.63 $6.897 $2.613 2016 $18.19 $13.269 $4.672 2017 $25.69 $17.656 $7.255 2018 $25.36 $20.805 $9.391 2019 $31.65 $22.548 $9.452 2020 $43.79 $23.858 $9.993 2021 $66.48 $27.403 $12.578 2022 $55.24 $33.169 $16.526 2023 $111.63 $35.798 $18.378 *Post-split adjusted basis , **Revenue and net income in $billions Over the course of the last decade, Broadcom’s revenue grew by more than 743% while its net income increased by over 1,268%. Despite a slight contraction in share price in 2022 during an extended bull market that had an outsized impact on the tech sector, on a post-split adjusted basis, shares of Broadcom have climbed 1,009.64% from 2014 through 2023. As the Silicon Valley mainstay looks towards the second half of the decade, 24/7 Wall Street has identified three key drivers that are likely to positively impact Broadcom’s growth metrics and stock performance through 2030. Key Drivers of Broadcom’s Stock Performance 1. Exceptional Track Record of Earnings and Revenue Beats: Going back to the first quarter of 2015, Broadcom has beaten earnings in every single quarter except one. That is one earnings miss over the course of 39 quarters. Expectations are that the company will continue to beat on earnings and revenue, with a forecast earnings per share (EPS) of $1.39 for the last quarter of 2024. In the third quarter of 2024, the company posted an impressive 17.65% year-over-year EPS gain, which year-over-year total revenue grew from $8.88 billion in July 2023 to $13.07 billion in July 2024 — an increase of 47.18%. 2. Filling the Gap NVIDIA Cannot Satisfy: For investors concerned about NVIDIA’s possible overvaluation or the company’s inability to single-handedly satisfy the explosive AI-driven semiconductor demand, Broadcom is an alternative that at current prices could be considered a bargain. In September, Barchart.com reported that the “stock looks deeply undervalued … based on its strong revenue, free cash flow, FCF margin, management guidance and analysts’ price targets.” Specifically, that free cash flow has grown markedly between FY 2019 to FY 2023, from $9.27 billion to $17.63 billion good for an increase of over 90%. As demand for semiconductors and microchips continues to grow, Broadcom has an abundance of cash ready to be deployed in order to match that growth. 3. Institutional Ownership: Broadcom is beloved by institutional investors, of which there are 3,382. Of the company’s 4.671 billion shares outstanding, a staggering 3.537 billion of them are held by institutional investors, according to Nasdaq.com. That accounts for 75.74% of the company’s entire stock. The top three largest holders are Vanguard Group with 448 million shares followed by BlackRock at 342 million and Capital World Investors with 224 million shares. Together, those three positions account for $175.432 million in share value. And in the past year, 1,760 institutional investors increased their positions. Broadcom (AVGO) Price Prediction in 2025 The current consensus median one-year price target for Broadcom is $195, representing a potential upside of 9.05% over the next 12 months. Of all the analysts covering Broadcom, the stock is a consensus buy, with a 1.43 ‘Buy’ rating on a scale from 1 (‘Strong Buy’) to 5 (‘Strong Sell’). By the end of 2025, 24/7 Wall Street‘s forecast for AVGO shares is $204.27, representing a 14.23% potential upside based on an EPS of $6.19 and a PE ratio of 33. Broadcom (AVGO) Stock Forecast Through 2030 Year Revenue* EPS 2025 $60.492 $6.19 2026 $67.906 $7.29 2027 $75.850 $8.82 2028 $85.222 $11.94 2029 $84.920 $14.93 2030 $86.618 $18.66 *Revenue and net income in $billions How Broadcom’s Next Five Years Could Play Out At the end of 2025, we forecast Broadcom’s stock to be trading for $204.27 based on revenue of $60.492 billion, a net income of $34.224 billion, and an EPS of $6.19. The following year, we estimate earnings per share of $7.29 on over $67 billion in revenue. Starting in 2027 through 2029, we expect a 13% growth in revenue and a 40% jump in earnings per share, bringing Broadcom’s price target from $238.14 in 2027 to $373.13 in 2029. Broadcom’s Price Target for 2030 By the conclusion of 2030, 24/7 Wall Street estimates Broadcom’s stock will trade at $429.09, representing a 139.95% increase from its current price, based on revenue of $86.618 billion and an EPS of $18.66.

Between its semiconductor, software and smartphone business segments, the stock has experienced sizable growth in the recent past: INSERT TABLE HERE Year Share Price* Revenue** Net Income** 2014 $10.06 $4.244 $1.343 2015 $14.63 $6.897 $2.613 2016 $18.19 $13.269 $4.672 2017 $25.69 $17.656 $7.255 2018 $25.36 $20.805 $9.391 2019 $31.65 $22.548 $9.452 2020 $43.79 $23.858 $9.993 2021 $66.48 $27.403 $12.578 2022 $55.24 $33.169 $16.526 2023 $111.63 $35.798 $18.378 *Post-split adjusted basis , **Revenue and net income in $billions Over the course of the last decade, Broadcom’s revenue grew by more than 743% while its net income increased by over 1,268%. Despite a slight contraction in share price in 2022 during an extended bull market that had an outsized impact on the tech sector, on a post-split adjusted basis, shares of Broadcom have climbed 1,009.64% from 2014 through 2023. As the Silicon Valley mainstay looks towards the second half of the decade, 24/7 Wall Street has identified three key drivers that are likely to positively impact Broadcom’s growth metrics and stock performance through 2030. Key Drivers of Broadcom’s Stock Performance 1. Exceptional Track Record of Earnings and Revenue Beats: Going back to the first quarter of 2015, Broadcom has beaten earnings in every single quarter except one. That is one earnings miss over the course of 39 quarters. Expectations are that the company will continue to beat on earnings and revenue, with a forecast earnings per share (EPS) of $1.39 for the last quarter of 2024. In the third quarter of 2024, the company posted an impressive 17.65% year-over-year EPS gain, which year-over-year total revenue grew from $8.88 billion in July 2023 to $13.07 billion in July 2024 — an increase of 47.18%. 2. Filling the Gap NVIDIA Cannot Satisfy: For investors concerned about NVIDIA’s possible overvaluation or the company’s inability to single-handedly satisfy the explosive AI-driven semiconductor demand, Broadcom is an alternative that at current prices could be considered a bargain. In September, Barchart.com reported that the “stock looks deeply undervalued … based on its strong revenue, free cash flow, FCF margin, management guidance and analysts’ price targets.” Specifically, that free cash flow has grown markedly between FY 2019 to FY 2023, from $9.27 billion to $17.63 billion good for an increase of over 90%. As demand for semiconductors and microchips continues to grow, Broadcom has an abundance of cash ready to be deployed in order to match that growth. 3. Institutional Ownership: Broadcom is beloved by institutional investors, of which there are 3,382. Of the company’s 4.671 billion shares outstanding, a staggering 3.537 billion of them are held by institutional investors, according to Nasdaq.com. That accounts for 75.74% of the company’s entire stock. The top three largest holders are Vanguard Group with 448 million shares followed by BlackRock at 342 million and Capital World Investors with 224 million shares. Together, those three positions account for $175.432 million in share value. And in the past year, 1,760 institutional investors increased their positions. Broadcom (AVGO) Price Prediction in 2025 The current consensus median one-year price target for Broadcom is $195, representing a potential upside of 13.50% over the next 12 months. Of all the analysts covering Broadcom, the stock is a consensus buy, with a 1.43 ‘Buy’ rating on a scale from 1 (‘Strong Buy’) to 5 (‘Strong Sell’). By the end of 2025, 24/7 Wall Street‘s forecast for AVGO shares is $204.27, representing a 18.90% potential upside based on an EPS of $6.19 and a PE ratio of 33.

The following year, we estimate earnings per share of $7.29 on over $67 billion in revenue. Starting in 2027 through 2029, we expect a 13% growth in revenue and a 40% jump in earnings per share, bringing Broadcom’s price target from $238.14 in 2027 to $373.13 in 2029. Broadcom’s Price Target for 2030 By the conclusion of 2030, 24/7 Wall Street estimates Broadcom’s stock will trade at $429.09, representing a 149.76% increase from its current price, based on revenue of $86.618 billion and an EPS of $18.66.

Cyprium Metals Ltd (ASX:CYM, OTC:CYPMF) is targeting a capital raise of around A$13.5 million before costs, having received strong commitments for a two-tranche placement of some 483.2 million new fully paid ordinary shares in the company at an issue price of A$0.028. The company says the placement received strong support from cornerstone investors, existing institutional shareholders and CYM directors. Executive chair Matt Fifield said: “It has been a very productive 2024. The company had strong support from shareholders to complete this important capital raise, positioning the company for another great year in 2025. “We expect to build off of our recently released PFS to materially advance the redevelopment of the Nifty Copper Complex in the first half of the year.” This included Flat Footed LLC (FF) which agreed to cornerstone the placement in the amount of A$5.3 million, in exchange for 20 million additional unlisted options, subject to shareholder approval. Directors of the company, or their nominees, have also committed to subscribe for placement shares in the aggregate amount of A$3.0 million. FF’s commitment and the directors’ participation will be subject to shareholder approval, to be sought at an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) in January. At the completion of the placement, FF stands to hold some 19% of the company’s fully paid ordinary shares. FF’s participation also remains subject to renewal of a previously obtained FIRB approval, which is expected in early 2025. Cyprium plans to channel proceeds from the placement into a range of operational and financial purposes, including: Additionally, funds will be allocated to working capital and covering the costs associated with the placement itself. The A$13.5 million will be raised using a two-tranche placement. Tranche 1 will raise around A$5.2 million under Cyprium’s existing placement capacity as per ASX Listing Rules 7.1 and 7.1A. Tranche 2 aims to raise about A$8.3 million, subject to shareholder approval, which includes participation from cornerstone investor Freeport Financial (FF) and company directors. The issue price for the placement shares is A$0.028 per share, a 3.7% premium to the last closing price of A$0.027 on December 10 and a 6.7% premium to the five-day volume weighted average price (VWAP) of A$0.026. Subscribers will also receive one unlisted option for every two shares purchased, with an exercise price of A$0.042 and an expiry date of December 31, 2027. Canaccord Genuity (TSX:CF, LSE:CF) acted as lead manager to the placement. The company also intends to undertake a non-renounceable retail entitlement offer to raise up to A$3.0 million on the same terms as the placement, including the placement options. The company is advanced in finalising the documentation for this offer and intends to make a further announcement next week. Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO, ETR:1YD) shares jumped to a record high in after-hours trading on Thursday after the chipmaker reported record-breaking results driven by surging demand for artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The company posted fiscal fourth-quarter revenue of $14.1 billion, in line with Wall Street estimates, while adjusted earnings per share of $1.42 and EBITDA of $9.09 billion both exceeded expectations. Broadcom CEO Hock Tan highlighted the significant role AI played in the company’s growth. “Semiconductor revenue was a record $30.1 billion, driven by AI revenue of $12.2 billion,” Tan said. “AI revenue grew 220% year-on-year, fueled by our leading AI XPUs and Ethernet networking portfolio.” For the fiscal year, Broadcom reported total revenue of $51.6 billion, up 44% year-on-year, with infrastructure software revenue soaring to $21.5 billion, thanks to the successful integration of VMware. Net income climbed to $4.32 billion in the fourth quarter, compared to $3.52 billion a year earlier. The company also announced a robust 11% dividend increase, raising its annualized payout to $2.36 per share, underscoring its confidence in sustained growth. Broadcom provided upbeat guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, forecasting revenue of $14.6 billion, exceeding analyst expectations of $14.55 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is projected to be 66% of revenue. “Continued strong AI demand momentum and synergies from VMware integration will drive our performance in the coming quarters,” said CFO Kirsten Spears. The explosive growth in AI revenue reflects Broadcom’s strategic focus on next-generation technology, including AI accelerators and networking solutions. These advancements are central to the company’s competitive edge in the semiconductor market, which supplies major tech giants like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL, ETR:APC)."

Lanthanein Resources Ltd (ASX:LNR, OTC:FRNRF) has kicked off diamond drilling at its Lady Grey Project at Mt Holland in Western Australia’s Yilgarn Craton. The Lady Grey gold prospect is adjacent to the historic Bounty Gold Mine which produced some 1.3 million ounces of gold on Covalent Lithium’s Mount Holland mine site. This is the second phase of the drilling program, testing the modelled conductor plate under modelled moving loop EM (MLEM) survey line #6. The modelled conductor plate under MLEM Line #6 is 200 metres below surface and dips to the east, and is being drilled from the existing historical access road which links the old Lady Ada mine and the Marvel Loch Forrestania Road. Drill testing will consist of the three reverse circulation (RC) precollars, previously completed to a maximum of 150 metres, with diamond tail drill holes as seen here: Modelled Conductor Plate (in Red) with Drill Holes Traces (in Blue) superimposed on Google Earth image and cross section below. Drilling of the first diamond tail into the MLEM conductor plate under EM line #6 is now underway. “Once again we are really excited to finally get the diamond bit spinning on the diamond tails testing the modelled EM conductor plate under Line #6 which coincides with a 75ppb Ultrafine (UFF) soil gold anomaly,” Lanthanein technical director Brian Thomas said. “We continue to liaise with DEMIRS on the PoW to enable drill testing of the much higher ranking EM conductor plate under Line #1 which coincides with the 256 ppb gold UFF soil anomaly with the flora and fauna survey report lodged with DEMIRS and the on ground heritage survey by Ballardong Aboriginal Corporation and their heritage consultants now complete.” Traditional Owners from the Ballardong Aboriginal Corporation with the assistance of their heritage consultants have carried out the on-ground heritage avoidance survey for MLEM Line #1 access track and drill line.

AVGO's robust growth prospects are driven by the growing hyperscaler demand for custom ASICs, one that is likely to be a top/ bottom-line driver through FY2027.

In the high-tech universe, there is a single common road that top-flight companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), and many others must travel to get their chips made, no matter where they hail from. That road inevitably leads to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (NYSE: TSM), the largest semiconductor foundry on the planet. When a company like Nvidia designs a new chip, it takes it to Taiwan Semiconductor to actually print the design on a silicon wafer. Taiwan Semiconductor is the top choice for Nvidia, AMD, and many other chip designers, thanks to its precision, quality control, and innovative technical capabilities. At the time of this writing, Taiwan Semiconductor commands over 60% of global spending at chip foundries. The explosion of growth in the artificial intelligence and data center arenas have led to a commensurate demand acceleration for Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) chips and a panoply of similar ones for those fields. By focusing on precision foundry work, Taiwan Semiconductor has become the premier “go-to” player, for chip designers, even among those competing in various sectors. Headwinds and Challenges Taiwan Semiconductor’s biggest threat is from a mainland China invasion of Taiwan, rather than from any market competitors. Despite its crucial place in the semiconductor supply chain, Taiwan Semiconductor is based in Taiwan. Due to claims by The People’s Republic of China’s leadership that Taiwan is a part of China proper, the nation is in a state of perpetual invasion alert. Any overt military action on Taiwanese soil could result in a domino-effect of chip shortages if Taiwan Semiconductor is forced to halt production. Taiwan Semiconductor announced a rise in prices for its 3-nanometer and 5-nm process products by up to 8%. However, Samsung is focusing on its 2-nm process to meet future technologies’ high-performance, low-power, and high-bandwidth requirements, and rival Intel has a 1.4-nm ultra-fine process slated to be unveiled in 2027. The semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical. While AI investment soars, Taiwan Semiconductor has few rivals of significance. During slow periods, semiconductor companies have often been glutted with excess inventory. It remains to be seen how TSM will handle a slowdown after ramping up production to such a high level. Nevertheless, investors are much more concerned with future stock performance over the next 1, 5, to 10 years. Although most Wall Street analysts will calculate 12-month forward projections, it’s clear that nobody has a consistent crystal ball, and plenty of unforeseen circumstances can render even near term prognostications irrelevant. 24/7 Wall Street aims to present some farther looking insights based on Taiwan Semiconductor’s own numbers, along with business and market development information that may be of help to our readers’ own research. Key Points In This Article: Taiwan Semiconductor has control of roughly 62% of the global chip market. For Taiwan, its semiconductor dominance is a good thing, from a national security perspective. Geopolitical observers frequently refer to Taiwan’s semiconductor industry as a “silicon shield” by serving as an incentive for the international community to keep Taiwan out of Beijing’s control. Taiwan Semiconductor’s focus on fabrication precision and its R&amp;D emphasis on miniaturization and efficiency are the main drivers for its huge market share from Nvidia, AMD, Apple, and other chip designers. Aware of its vulnerability to geopolitical destabilization from China, Taiwan Semiconductor has strategically diversified some geographical manufacturing with new US factories in Arizona and Washington, one in Dresden, Germany, and JVs with Sony and Denso in Japan. Apple is hugely dependent on Taiwan Semiconductor, and has been since 2014. Apple announced a deal in 2023 to buy 100% of the output of the most advanced chips from Taiwan Semiconductor in Taiwan (and from its AZ plant in 2024). This move guaranteed that none of Apple’s competitors could acquire similar chips for more than a year.

Taiwan Semiconductor News and Updates 12/20/2024 The Biden administration is planning to blacklist Sophgo, a Chinese company illegally using a Taiwan Semiconductor chip in a Huawei AI processor. The chip, which was found in Huawei’s Ascend 910B, matched one ordered by Sophgo from TSMC. 12/18/2024 Taiwan Semiconductor’s Arizona-based chip fabrication plant is almost back on schedule according to the company’s Chairman, Rick Cassidy. The Arizona plant is the most advanced chip fabrication facility in the United States, producing 4-nanometer chips. 12/16/2024 Taiwan Semiconductor’s stock price experienced a slight increase of 0.1% today, trading as high as $205.50. However, trading volume was lower than average, with only 5.8 million shares changing hands. 12/12/2024 Taiwan Semiconductor’s stock price dipped 0.5% today, trading as low as $192.21. 12/11/2024 Taiwan Semiconductor has released a new report illustrating a solid financial performance for November 2024. The company’s revenue for the month reached NT$276.06 billion, marking a 34% year-over-year increase. 12/9/2024 Taiwan Semiconductor’s stock price declined slightly today, trading as low as $199.16. The stock traded lower than its previous closing price, with a significantly lower than average trading volume. 12/6/2024 Nvidia’s stock price experienced a slight decline of 0.4% to $144.48 in early Friday trading. However, for the week, the stock has seen a 4.8% increase. 12/5/2024 Tawaian Semiconductor may soon be making Nvidia’s powerful new Blackwell AI chips. Production on the chips could begin as early as next year at TSMC’s new factory in Arizona, which is currently under construction. Currently, the chips are manufactured in Taiwan at TSMC’s main plants. However, while the initial stages of production can occur in Arizona, the chips would still need to be shipped back to Taiwan for final packaging. 11/27/2024 Taiwan Semiconducter’s large investment in U.S. manufacturing was a strategic move to diversify its operations and address geopolitical tensions. However, experts suggest that the advanced chip production capabilities in the U.S. may lag behind those in Taiwan for some time. 11/26/2024 Taiwan Semiconductor experienced a slight decline of 0.1% in its share price today, trading as low as $183.87. 5 to 10 Year Review Apple Computer procures nearly 100% of its CPUs and other chips from Taiwan Semiconductor. 2014 was the year that the TSM-Apple cooperation began in earnest, with Apple’s A8 and A8X SoCss. Such has the cooperation expanded that Apple has gone to TSM for nearly 100% of its chip requirements by 2024. Opposing patent infringement lawsuits with GlobalFoundries in 2019 eventually settled with a cross-licensing agreement, which ends in 2029. 2020 saw Taiwan Semiconductor prudently decide to diversify its manufacturing by opening up new plants in Phoenix, AZ, and Dresden, Germany. In July 2020, TSM signed a 20-year deal with Ørsted to buy the entire production of two offshore wind farms under development off Taiwan’s west coast. At the time of its signing, it was the world’s largest corporate green energy order ever made. 2021 saw TSM form joint ventures with Sony and Denso in Japan.

Taiwan Semiconductor expects its 2024 capital expenditure budget to hit $32 billion. 70% to 80% of the budget will be allocated to advanced process technologies, 20% will be directed to specialty technologies, and 10% will be spent on advanced packaging, testing, and mass-making. The Company’s revenue growth should continue to accelerate due to its leading-edge N3 manufacturing node. Taiwan Semiconductor plans to commence its 2-nm process in 2025. Strong demand for chips used in artificial intelligence and cloud storage data center applications from Nvidia, AMD, and others shows no sign of curtailing. Thanks to its uniquely advanced manufacturing capabilities, Taiwan Semiconductor can easily scale for demand acceleration, and holds close to a near monopoly on large GPU chip contracts from major semiconductor designers for AI and data center use, even among competing designers. Total spending on AI chip content and related systems is forecast to reach $193.3 billion in 2027, according to estimates from IDC. That’s up from $117.5 billion this year, translating into an 18% compound annual growth rate over the next three years. Taiwan Semiconductor has national interest and support from the Taiwanese government in maintaining its wide competitive advantage, as the tech industry’s dependence on TSM-made chips incentivizes the international community to keep a China invasion in check. Stock Price Prediction for 2025 The consensus rating for Taiwan Semiconductor from over a dozen Wall Street analysts is “buy”(11 buy, 4 outperform,1 hold). The average price target in 12 months is $210.79, which is roughly 1.39% above the current price. 24/7 Wall Street’s 12-month projection for Taiwan Semiconductors’ price is $183.92, which is -11.53% below the current price. While Taiwan Semiconductor will start its 2-nm process in 2025, Samsung has a vested interest in developing its own niche advantage and support from the Korean government in that space. As a result, we don’t anticipate as big of a 2025 surge from 2-nm as other analysts might. Taiwan Semiconductor’s Next 5 Years’ Outlook Since Taiwan Semiconductor consumes as much as 5% of Taiwan’s entire energy output, its Ørsted wind farm energy production should manifest tangible cost savings benefits. Therefore, we project 2026’s stock price to hit $186.00, a modest .74% year-over-year gain. While its 2-nm process will likely compete favorably at the start against Samsung, the TSM competitive advantage in other avenues of chip manufacturing will ultimately prove to be overwhelming. The anticipated surge of data center spending on chips should fuel larger contracts. Collaborations with research institutions and tech giants in developing next-generation AI chips could open new revenue streams and strengthen its position as an innovation leader in the industry. Our projection for 2027 is $206.80. 2028 should begin to see the rewards from the 2024 R&amp;D surge of $32 billion in advanced process technologies. New products from TSM investments in quantum computing research are expected to bear fruit by 2028, potentially revolutionizing certain computing applications. The company’s focus on developing ultra-low power consumption chips for IoT and edge computing devices could position it as a key player in the growing market for energy-efficient technologies. The 2028 24/7 Wall Street price target is $213.90. 2029 will mark the expiration of Taiwan Semiconductor’s GlobalFoundries cross-licensing agreement, which should double up the revenues from that stream. Further developments in chips for quantum computing, healthcare and other applications can open up more direct government contract opportunities. US and German TSM factories should be operating at full capacity by 2029. We anticipate a price jump to $245.99. Taiwan Semiconductor Stock in 2030 TSM’s work in quantum computing should pave the way for neuromorphic computing chips that can mimic many human brain functions. By 2030, Taiwan Semiconductor’s work in quantum computing should pave the way for neuromorphic computing chips at the forefront of AI applications. These would mimic human brain functions more closely than ever before. The company’s involvement in space exploration projects and renewable energy initiatives may also diversify its revenue streams and enhance its global technological influence. We expect a $254.59 stock price, representing a 22.46% gain over today’s stock price. Year P/E Ratio EPS Price 2025 22 $8.36 $183.92 2026 20 $9.30 $186.00 2027 22 $9.40 $206.80 2028 20 $10.70 $213.90 2029 20 $12.30 $245.99 2030 18 $14.14 $254.59 Want to Retire Early?

Key Points QQQI, JEPQ, SPYI, and MSTY offer eye-catching yields for ambitious passive income investors. You can try all four of these high-yield ETFs for diversified exposure to a wide range of stocks. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) In recent years, ultra-high-yield exchange traded funds (ETFs) have opened the door to new possibilities for aggressive income harvesters. If you pick your ETFs carefully, you can practically turn your portfolio into a passive income machine. Using high-yield ETFs to generate steady income is a smart strategy, but it takes time and research to build a reliable income machine. So, to save you some of the trouble, I&#8217;ve hand-picked these four fantastic funds with big yields. Furthermore, if you give these four ETFs a try, you can cover different market sectors to diversify your portfolio. NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF (QQQI) If you&#8217;re on the hunt for tech-sector exposure, big yield, and frequent payouts, look no further. Truly, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF (NASDAQ:QQQI) is an ambitious income investor&#8217;s dream fund. First and foremost, the QQQI ETF offers a huge distribution yield (i.e., the annualized cash payout to your portfolio) of 13.92%. This positions the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF among the most generous high-yield funds available today. Plus, there&#8217;s another reason why the QQQI ETF is a dividend achiever. Specifically, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF pays its cash distributions on a monthly basis instead of making you wait three months for the next payout. Granted, you&#8217;ll have to pay an expense ratio, which is the annualized management fee that&#8217;s automatically deducted from the fund&#8217;s share price. When it comes to the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF, the expense ratio is 0.68%, which is slightly high but not outrageous. Just as importantly, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF invests in components of the technology-heavy NASDAQ 100 index. With roughly 100 holdings, the QQQI ETF includes well-established tech winners like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). In other words, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF isn&#8217;t only a passive income powerhouse with a sizable yield. It&#8217;s also an easy way to diversify your portfolio across dozens of tech-market standouts, and this can add an extra layer of safety. JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPQ) In some ways, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:JEPQ) is similar to the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF. Yet, with the JEPQ ETF you&#8217;ll get the peace of mind that comes with prestigious management from financial giant JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). Like the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF focuses on the NASDAQ 100. JEPQ has 108 stocks in its holdings, and the fund is strongly weighted toward large-cap technology stocks (Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and so on). Also, just like the QQQI ETF, the JEPQ ETF pays out its distributions on a monthly basis. However, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF has a rolling 12-month dividend yield of 11.01%, which isn&#8217;t quite as high as the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF&#8217;s gigantic 13.92% distribution yield. On the other hand, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF brings you active management from the one and only JPMorgan Chase. That&#8217;s a safety feature to consider, and the fund&#8217;s expense ratio is only 0.35%. Therefore, you might consider leveraging the expertise of a legendary asset manager with the comparatively low-fee JEPQ ETF. NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF (SPYI) Mind you, I didn&#8217;t turn my portfolio into a passive income machine by only investing in NASDAQ 100 based funds. Indeed, I diversified my holdings even further with a very broad-based fund known as the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF (BATS:SPYI). Like QQQI and JEPQ, SPYI pays out its distributions each and every month. Yet, unlike those other two funds, the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF is based on the S&amp;P 500 rather than the NASDAQ 100. With around 500 stocks in its holdings, the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF is more diversified than QQQI and JEPQ. You&#8217;ll get exposure to tech names like Apple and NVIDIA with the SPYI ETF, but you&#8217;ll also participate in the growth of non-technology-sector businesses like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). For active management and the enhanced safety that comes with wide portfolio breadth, the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF charges an expense ratio of 0.68%. However, the fund&#8217;s hefty 12.11% annual distribution rate more than makes up for the management fees, so SPYI is a great choice for monthly income seekers. YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF (MSTY) Finally, after focusing on safety and diversification with the first three ETFs, now we can ramp up the risk-and-reward profile with a fourth fund. I&#8217;m referring to an aggressive but fascinating fund known as the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:MSTY). You won&#8217;t get much diversification with the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF. Instead, you&#8217;ll get an annual expense ratio of 0.99% and an eye-watering distribution rate of 143.11%. The fund achieves this through actively trading U.S. Treasury bonds and options on Microstrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) stock. As you may be aware, Microstrategy stock is volatile and involves a great deal of risk. You&#8217;ll get sizable monthly distributions with MSTY, but a downturn in MSTR stock could be problematic for your portfolio. Because this fund is very risky, my passive income machine only includes a few shares of the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF. For a more favorable safety-and-yield mix, consider taking a larger position in SPYI, a smaller stake in QQQI and JEPQ, and a tiny position in MSTY.The post These 4 Dividend ETFs (QQQI, JEPQ, SPYI, MSTY) Are Passive Income Machines appeared first on 24/7 Wall St.."

The idea is to pick out ETFs with notable distribution yields (i.e., annualized cash payment percentages), but also to focus on a wide variety of funds with share-price growth potential. Now, let&#8217;s drill down on five fabulous ETFs so you can start accumulating shares for your income-machine portfolio today. NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF (QQQI) The name of the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF (NASDAQ:QQQI) might lead you to assume that this fund only offers a hefty yield. There&#8217;s more to the story, though, as the QQQI ETF also enables investors to participate in strong technology-focused growth opportunities. Based on the NASDAQ 100 stock index with approximately 100 holdings, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF includes many large-cap tech names you&#8217;ll surely recognize. Some examples are NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). There&#8217;s no denying that technology giants like Apple and NVIDIA are robust revenue generators. Consequently, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF share price could grow substantially over the long term. At the same time, many investors flock to the QQQI ETF for its eye-catching 13.92% distribution yield. Granted, the fund subtracts an annualized management fee (also known as the expense ratio) of 0.68% from the share price. Still, even after the expense ratio is taken out, investors can look forward to outstanding annual income with the QQQI ETF. Along with that, you&#8217;ll get to participate in the growth prospects of terrific tech titans when you hold the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF. JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPQ) There&#8217;s another passive income machine that&#8217;s similar to QQQI, but it&#8217;s not identical. Brought to you by famous financier JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:JEPQ) squeezes extra income from a range of high-confidence technology leaders. Much like the QQQI ETF, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF focuses on the NASDAQ 100 and includes around 100 stocks (108, to be exact). From Microsoft to Apple, Amazon, and many more, you&#8217;ll find plenty of high-growth tech names in JEPQ. There&#8217;s a trade-off with the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF when compared to the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF. On the negative side, JEPQ has a rolling 12-month dividend yield of 11.01%, which isn’t as impressive as QQQI&#8217;s 13.92% distribution yield. On the positive side, however, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF has an annualized expense ratio of 0.35%. This is lower than the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF&#8217;s 0.68% annual management fee. Perhaps most importantly, you&#8217;ll have the reassurance that comes with well-established fund management by JPMorgan Chase. Thus, for an interesting alternative to the QQQI ETF, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF is absolutely worth considering. Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) Maybe you&#8217;re seeking a passive income machine that&#8217;s not as technology-heavy as QQQI and JEPQ. In that case, you&#8217;ll want to check out the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHD). This fund includes has 103 stocks in its portfolio, but SCHD doesn&#8217;t track the NASDAQ 100 index. Instead, the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index. Take a look at the fund’s top 10 holdings and you’ll find some technology firms, such as Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN). Yet, you&#8217;ll also see names from other sectors, including Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and Conoco Phillips (NYSE:COP). Moreover, the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF offers a trailing 12-month distribution yield of 3.72% with an annual expense ratio of just 0.06%. The ultra-low management fees allow investors to grow their accounts steadily with the SCHD ETF. Two More Picks for Low Volatility To cap off this list of passive income machine picks, I&#8217;ve got two relatively low-risk funds to show you. First, there&#8217;s an ETF that concentrates on dividend-growing businesses instead of gigantic yield. The Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF (NYSEARCA:DIVO) features a 4.81% annual distribution rate but also a 0.56% expense ratio, so the income opportunities are good but not jaw-dropping. On the other hand, DIVO tends to be low-volatility as it holds a diverse array of safe names, such as Home Depot, Visa (NYSE:V), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), Microsoft, and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). The Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF emphasizes &#8220;high-quality large cap companies with a history of dividend and earnings growth.&#8221; This approach will typically reduce share-price volatility, so investors can sleep well at night while collecting passive income with DIVO. In a similar vein, the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF (BATS:SPYI) is de-risked because it holds well-known large-cap stocks in multiple sectors. Indeed, SPYI might be the least risky fund on this list as it includes approximately 500 stocks in its holdings. Because the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF generates income from the S&amp;P 500 index, it is a widely diversified fund. So, there&#8217;s a safety factor built into the SPYI ETF. In addition, the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF is an enticing passive income machine with a 12.11% annual distribution rate. The fund&#8217;s 0.68% annual expense ratio isn&#8217;t super-low, but the fees may be justified as SPYI brings high yield and instant diversification to the table. All in all, I like DIVO and SPYI for reduced volatility, SCHD for low management fees, and QQQI and JEPQ for technology-sector exposure.The post These 5 ETFs (QQQI, JEPQ, SCHD, DIVO, SPYI) Are Passive Income Machines appeared first on 24/7 Wall St.."

Wall Street Bullish on This Big Tech Stock 9:57 am by Gerelyn Terzo Wall Street analysts have turned increasingly bullish on Amazon stock. Here&#8217;s a roundup of the most recent analyst moves: Earlier this week, BofA reiterated a Buy rating on AMZN and raised its price target from $230 to $248. The analysts highlighted Amazon’s advancements in robotics and AI, noting these could add approximately 2 percentage points to retail margins, supporting further upside. JPMorgan maintained an Overweight rating and increased its price target from $225 to $240. The firm emphasized Amazon’s leadership in e-commerce and Amazon Web Services (AWS), along with margin tailwinds and a strong free cash flow (FCF) ramp, fueling a bullish long-term outlook. Barclays reiterated an Overweight rating with a price target of $240, noting that delays in Amazon’s Project Kuiper (satellite internet initiative) are expected and priced into the stock. They expressed confidence in Amazon’s 2025 launch cadence and cost guidance for the project. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets remain fickle, but today there is reason to be optimistic. Discussions have reemerged between the White House and Beijing, according to Chinese media reports. This has revived the &#8216;risk-on&#8217; trade and sent major stock market indices higher across the board. In a last-ditch effort, officials from both sides are trying to salvage trade talks that had previously stalled. Sectors of the economy are mixed today, with no clear conviction in either direction. Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) has been capturing attention lately, most recently for announcing a $10 billion bet on AI-powered data centers in North Carolina. The stock is up 1.7% today. Additionally, the markets are keeping an eye on the broader S&amp;P 500 index, which will announce changes to its member lineup on Friday. Bank of America has offered its two cents, suggesting that AppLovin (Nasdaq: APP) and Carvana (NYSE: CVNA) could muscle their way into the index. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 60.49 (+0.14%) Nasdaq Composite: 72.99 (+0.38%) S&amp;P 500: Up 16.85 (+0.28%) Market Movers In a bullish move for Big Tech, analyst firm Daiwa has reiterated its &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating on Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) stock, lifting the price target to $165 per share, reflecting upside potential of 17%. Separately, Bank of America analysts reemphasized NVDA stock as one of their top picks with a $180 price objective, saying it&#8217;s in the best spot to capture the benefits of the &#8220;AI tide.&#8221; Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) is losing close to 5% today after Elon Musk turned his attention to the U.S. tax bill. Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) will release its quarterly results after the closing bell today. The stock is trading slightly lower this morning. Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE: PG), a Dow component, is down 1.4% after revealing massive layoffs to the tune of 7,000 jobs amid a wider corporate restructuring.

Wall Street Bullish on Big Tech 10:17 am by Gerelyn Terzo Wall Street analysts are showing growing optimism regarding Amazon stock. Below is a summary of the latest analyst actions: Earlier this week, BofA reconfirmed its Buy rating for Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN), elevating its price target from $230 to $248. The analysts underscored Amazon&#8217;s progress in robotics and artificial intelligence, suggesting these innovations could boost retail margins by roughly two percentage points, thereby supporting additional upside. JPMorgan sustained its Overweight rating and adjusted its price target upward from $225 to $240. The firm underscored Amazon&#8217;s dominant position in e-commerce and Amazon Web Services (AWS), alongside favorable margin trends and a robust FCF acceleration, contributing to a positive long-term outlook. Barclays maintained an Overweight rating with a $240 price target, commenting that anticipated delays in Amazon&#8217;s Project Kuiper (its satellite internet venture) are already factored into the stock&#8217;s valuation. They conveyed confidence in Amazon&#8217;s 2025 launch schedule and cost projections for the initiative. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets remain unpredictable, and today is no exception. After starting out of the gate higher on trade talk hopes, stocks have since erased those gains. According to Chinese state media, talks have resumed between the White House and Beijing. In a final push, officials from both nations are attempting to rescue stalled trade negotiations. This appeared to have reignited the &#8220;risk-on&#8221; sentiment, but the markets have since taken a nosedive. Economic sectors are showing mixed signals today, lacking a decisive direction. The SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) is now down 0.20% on the day. Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) has been in the spotlight recently, particularly after unveiling a $10 billion investment in AI-powered data centers in North Carolina. The stock has climbed 1.7% today. Meanwhile, the broader S&amp;P 500 index is under scrutiny as it prepares to announce changes to its constituent companies on Friday. Bank of America has weighed in, suggesting that AppLovin (Nasdaq: APP) and Carvana (NYSE: CVNA) might gain entry into the index. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 113.82 (-0.27%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 45.89 (-0.24%) S&amp;P 500: Down 15.37 (-0.25%) Market Movers In a strong vote of confidence for Big Tech, analyst firm Daiwa has reaffirmed its &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating on Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) stock, increasing its price target to $165 per share, indicating a potential upside of 17%. Separately, Bank of America analysts reiterated NVDA stock as a top selection with a $180 price objective, stating it&#8217;s ideally positioned to ride the &#8220;AI tide.&#8221; Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) is down nearly 5% today after Elon Musk commented on the U.S. tax bill. Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) is set to release its quarterly earnings after the market closes today. The stock is trading marginally lower this morning.

Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Rubrik the Rare Winner Tonight 5:04 pm by Joel South Tonight&#8217;s most anticipated earnings have generally been dreary. Lululemon is down 22%, DocuSign down 16%, and Broadcom is down 4%. So, perhaps its not surprising that after initial gains of 6%, shares of Rubrick are now flat after-hours as of 5:05 p.m. ET. The company still has its earnings call, but after a furious rally in stocks across the past two months, expectations for earnings have clearly risen. Shares Surge on Strong Earnings 4:34 pm by Joel South Shares of RBRK soared in after-hours trading after reporting strong Q1 results. The stock is up 6.02% since the close. Rubrik kicked off its FY 2026 with impressive Q1 results, exceeding all guided metrics and showcasing strong growth across key areas. The cyber resilience company reported a 49% year-over-year revenue increase to $278.5 million and a 38% rise in subscription annual recurring revenue (ARR) to $1.18 billion. The company now has 2,381 customers generating over $100K in subscription ARR, up 28% from the prior year. CEO Bipul Sinha credited the results to focused innovation and execution, while CFO Kiran Choudary highlighted ongoing progress toward profitability. Non-GAAP gross margin improved to 80.5%, and free cash flow turned positive at $33.3 million. Rubrik also announced major partnerships with Google Cloud, Deloitte, NTT Data and Rackspace to expand its data protection and AI security offerings. Looking ahead, Rubrik projects Q2 revenue between $281 million and $283 million and expects full-year revenue to reach up to $1.19 billion. Risks 3:32 pm 1. Channel Saturation and GTM Efficiency PressureRubrik is scaling fast, but sales and marketing spend remains high. If CAC payback extends or sales cycles elongate — especially in regulated verticals — investors may question whether the growth is too expensive. High cash burn without operating leverage risks a rerating, even if ARR expands. 2. Competitive Intensity and Pricing RiskRubrik competes with Veeam, Cohesity, and emerging vendors — many with lower-cost backup offerings. While Rubrik has positioned itself as a premium, AI-native cyber recovery platform, pricing pressure could emerge in mid-market deals or renewals. Any sign of discounting or ASP compression would undercut gross margin confidence. 3. Reliance on Cloud PartnershipsRubrik’s Microsoft and AWS integrations are strengths — but also dependencies. If those partners pivot product strategy, shift co-selling alignment, or prioritize their own tools, Rubrik’s funnel could be disrupted. Partner fatigue or shifting incentives are execution risks not fully priced in. 4. IPO Transition and Reporting ScrutinyAs a newly public company, Rubrik must now meet the rigor of quarterly financial scrutiny. Any inconsistency in disclosure, slippage in RPO, or misalignment between growth and margin could trigger outsized stock reactions. Execution discipline — not just topline growth — will define Rubrik’s post-IPO multiple. Keys to Watch 3:31 pm 1. ARR Growth Trajectory and Large Deal MixWith ~$784M in ARR entering Q1, the Street expects Rubrik to exit FY25 on a ~$1B ARR run-rate. Key to this is continued growth in $1M+ ARR customers and large enterprise wins. Investors will be looking for sequential adds in that cohort, as well as commentary on deal cycles and retention. 2. Microsoft Partnership ActivationRubrik’s GTM alignment with Microsoft — particularly around Azure and Office 365 data protection — is seen as a key differentiator. This quarter, investors want evidence that joint field activity is translating to pipeline conversion, particularly in mid-market and public sector verticals. Deal attribution commentary will be closely parsed. 3. Gross Margin Stability and Product ExpansionLast reported gross margin was 78%, among the highest in SaaS. If this holds or improves, it supports the long-term model of Rubrik as a profitable security platform. Management may offer commentary on adoption of new SKUs — including sensitive data classification and policy automation tools — which could lift ASP and reduce churn. 4. RPO Conversion and Billing PatternsRubrik’s RPO grew 55% YoY last reported, and Q1 is expected to show how much of that is converting to near-term revenue. Investors will track deferred revenue build and renewal velocity to assess whether the business is front-loaded or recurring. Clean billings execution would reinforce ARR confidence. Consensus Estimates 3:30 pm Q1 FY2025 Street Estimates: Revenue: $187.2M (+38% YoY) Adjusted EPS: –$0.33 Gross Margin: ~78% Adj. EBITDA: –$32.4M ARR (prior disclosed): $784M Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO): $811M Growth Metrics to Watch: $1M+ ARR Customers: 117 last reported (+66% YoY) Net Revenue Retention: ~120% Multi-product adoption rate: &gt;50% The Street expects Rubrik to sustain strong revenue momentum into Q2, with guide implications pointing to $200M+ quarterly run-rate before year-end. Analysts are looking for updates to customer count, upsell trends, and vertical-specific traction, particularly in public sector, healthcare, and regulated industries. Cash burn will remain elevated — EBITDA losses are expected near $30M+ — but the focus is on narrowing those losses quarter over quarter while maintaining high ARR expansion and multi-product attach rates. Any progress toward FCF breakeven or improved CAC payback would be viewed as a sign of operational maturity. Rubrik enters its first earnings release as a public company with significant expectations baked into its valuation and narrative. The cybersecurity and data resilience platform is positioned as a high-growth, cloud-native alternative to legacy backup and recovery vendors — and the Street is watching closely to see whether that pitch holds up under public scrutiny. Consensus expects $187.2M in revenue (+38% YoY) and an adjusted EPS loss of –$0.33, sharply improved from –$1.58 YoY. The quarter will test Rubrik’s ability to maintain hypergrowth while narrowing losses and will serve as the first checkpoint for public market investors to evaluate execution quality, GTM leverage, and forward ARR visibility. Management previously disclosed ARR of $784M and 55% YoY growth in RPO. This quarter is expected to show continued traction in large enterprise deals — especially those tied to Microsoft cloud workloads. A key test will be whether customers adopting Rubrik Security Cloud are scaling usage and adding modules such as threat detection, compliance auditing, and ransomware response automation. Given Rubrik’s premium valuation and compressed FCF profile, execution on both growth and efficiency must be crisp. Investors will seek signals that sales productivity is improving, gross margins remain near 78%, and that runway remains long even as growth decelerates modestly from IPO-era acceleration.

Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Conference Call is Starting Now 5:07 pm by Joel South Broadcom&#8217;s conference call is starting now. You can listen in here if you&#8217;d like. The stock is currently down 3.4%. However, it&#8217;s worth noting that almost every major stock reporting tonight is seeing red after-hours. Lululemon is down 22%, DocuSign is down 16%, and Rubrik jumped 6% after its earnings were released. However, its shares are now flat. Translation: After a furious two-month stock market rally, investors expectations for what companies should be delivering has risen. If any material news impacts Broadcom&#8217;s share price during its conference call we&#8217;ll post an update. One Standout Figure from Broadcom&#039;s Earnings 4:41 pm by Eric Bleeker One figure to pay attention to is that Broadcom is guiding to AI revenue next quarter of $5.1 billion, that&#8217;s above Wall Street&#8217;s expectations of $4.8 billion. Keep in mind that Broadcom&#8217;s stock has moved significantly in recent quarters based on conference call commentary, so where it&#8217;s trading right now (-2.5%) could be very different than where it opens tomorrow if the company&#8217;s CEO gives some especially bullish comments about future AI demand. It&#039;s a Beat and Raise for Broadcom - So Why Aren&#039;t Shares Moving? 4:37 pm by Joel South Broadcom issued a beat and raise for tonight&#8217;s earnings, not only surpassing last quarter&#8217;s expectations from Wall Street, but also topping guidance. So why aren&#8217;t the share moving north after-hours? Simply put, Broadcom has rallied a remarkable 78% since April 4th, so plenty of optimism was built in headed into these earnings. A slight beat and guide for the coming quarter above consensus is generally expected when stocks have rallied as furiously as Broadcom has in recent months. Make no mistake, Broadcom&#8217;s quarter was solid and its guidance for next quarter points to continuing momentum. However, the results are also not far enough above consensus to move the needle much after Broadcom&#8217;s recent run. Broadcom Shares are Rebounding 4:29 pm by Joel South Broadcom shares are rebounding, now roughly flat after initially dropping several percent after the company&#8217;s earnings release. Shares Slide Despite Record Q2 Results on Surging AI Demand 4:26 pm by Joel South Broadcom posted strong Q2 results, with revenue climbing 20% year-over-year to a record $15 billion, fueled by rapid growth in AI semiconductor demand and contributions from VMware. The company reported GAAP net income of $5 billion and non-GAAP net income of $7.8 billion. Adjusted EBITDA rose 35% to $10.0 billion, representing 67% of revenue. AI revenue reached $4.4 billion in Q2, up 46% from the previous year, and is projected to grow further to $5.1 billion in Q3. CEO Hock Tan noted continued investment from hyperscale partners and 10 straight quarters of AI revenue growth. Broadcom also generated $6.4 billion in free cash flow, returning $7 billion to shareholders via dividends and share buybacks. The company expects Q3 revenue of approximately $15.8 billion, up 21% year-over-year, and maintains strong profitability guidance. Despite this, shares slipped in after-hour trading 28.6% from the close. Execution Risks 3:33 pm by Joel South Despite strong momentum, Broadcom’s Q2 setup is not without potential downside risks. The most immediate is hyperscaler AI capex cyclicality. While demand remains strong, cloud buildouts can be lumpy, and any signal of Q3 digestion or budget reallocation — especially in networking — could imply slower sequential growth, even if the long-term trajectory remains intact. On the software side, customer churn within VMware remains a meaningful risk. Broadcom’s go-to-market changes — including consolidation of SKUs and tighter bundling — could alienate long-time customers, especially in segments like EUC (End-User Computing) that are being divested or deemphasized. If bookings slow or renewal rates dip below plan, the market may question whether VMware revenue is truly durable. Another issue is regulatory scrutiny and deal pipeline constraints. Broadcom has long relied on M&amp;A to build scale and pricing power. But with global regulators now increasingly aggressive, further transformative acquisitions could face long timelines or outright rejection, limiting long-term inorganic growth potential. Finally, valuation has expanded significantly. The stock trades at ~25x forward EPS — toward the high end of its historical range. That leaves limited room for error on the Q2 results or full-year guide. If margins contract, or if guidance remains unchanged despite tailwinds, the bar may prove too high. Keys to Watch 3:32 pm by Joel South 1. GenAI Ethernet Momentum and ASP Trends:The durability of Broadcom’s AI networking tailwind is the single most important question heading into this release. Investors want to know if demand from hyperscalers is accelerating, stabilizing, or softening — and whether AVGO is gaining share vs. InfiniBand-based alternatives like Nvidia’s Mellanox stack. A beat in networking and bullish comments on demand visibility into 2H FY24 would reinforce Broadcom’s role as a backbone infrastructure supplier for AI training and inference clusters. 2. VMware Margins, Churn, and Booking Signals:While headline growth will be boosted by VMware consolidation, investors care more about how profitable those dollars are. If VMware segment operating margin exceeds 60% or gross margin trends toward the high-70s, the software synergy thesis gains credibility. Watch closely for commentary on customer renewals, Net Revenue Retention (NRR), and any soft patches in product overlap areas. 3. Guidance Lift and Fiscal Discipline:Management has guided conservatively over the past year, often beating internally restrained expectations. If Broadcom raises its full-year revenue outlook to $51B or above and holds EBITDA margin at 60%, it would confirm confidence in both software execution and sustained AI spend. That could justify further multiple expansion in the mid-20x EPS range. Core Results &amp; Segment Highlights 3:31 pm by Joel South Q2 FY2024 Street Estimates: Revenue: $12.04B Adjusted EPS: $10.84 YoY Revenue Growth: +37.6% Adj. Gross Margin (guide): ~75% Adj. EBITDA Margin (guide): 60% FY24 (Implied): Full-Year Revenue Guide (prior): $50B AI Infrastructure Run-Rate (last disclosed): $1B/quarter VMware Contribution Estimate (Q2): ~$2.3B Legacy Semiconductor Core (ex-VMware): ~$9.7B Broadcom has beaten Street EPS estimates in each of the last 12 quarters. Last quarter, it reported EPS of $10.99 on $11.96B in revenue, exceeding guidance on both lines and attributing the strength primarily to AI-related Ethernet demand and an unexpectedly smooth start to VMware integration. This quarter, analysts are expecting flat-to-up sequential trends in networking, mid-single-digit growth in broadband, and mid-teens growth in wireless — all consistent with seasonal patterns. Software is expected to rise sharply YoY due to VMware, but investors will differentiate between organic Broadcom software and new VMware revenue. Most expect VMware to contribute &gt;$2B per quarter with 70–75% gross margin and 55–60% EBITDA margin — if Broadcom delivers higher, that would confirm synergy realization is ahead of pace. Notably, guidance will carry more weight than the headline numbers. Street models are anticipating an update to full-year revenue closer to $51B and potential EBITDA upside if VMware cost actions flow through earlier than planned. Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) enters its Q2 FY2024 earnings release as one of the most closely watched semiconductor and infrastructure software plays, sitting squarely at the intersection of two defining technology narratives: hyperscale AI infrastructure deployment and large-scale software consolidation. Expectations are high across the board, and the stock has reflected that enthusiasm — surging over 30% in the past month to all-time highs, with investors pricing in both generative AI upside and a smooth VMware integration path. Analysts are modeling $12.04B in revenue (+37.6% YoY) and $10.84 in adjusted EPS, with roughly $2.3B expected from VMware in its first full quarter post-acquisition. The remainder of the growth is expected to come from AI-enabling components — especially Broadcom’s switch ASICs, custom silicon, and Ethernet fabric interconnects, which are widely deployed by hyperscale customers like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. The company previously disclosed that GenAI-related sales were running at a $1B quarterly pace — and any update on that figure will be a core focus. Broadcom’s results will serve as a high-stakes litmus test for enterprise AI infrastructure demand, especially given recent mixed signals from peers. Nvidia has flagged broad-based hyperscaler spend, while Marvell noted pushouts. Broadcom’s exposure is deeper in networking, and the expectation is for that segment to grow over 50% YoY, barring any cloud digestion pause. Just as important is the VMware narrative. Management previously guided to 60% EBITDA margins on a combined basis and expressed confidence that early cost synergies would materialize faster than expected. But as VMware customer contracts turn over, the Street wants proof that Broadcom can retain revenue while simplifying the product portfolio. Any sign of subscription churn or integration friction could undercut the broader software platform thesis.

At what age would you buy dividend stocks if you could go back in time? The Dividends subreddit was bustling after one investor asked if people regretted buying dividend stocks too early or too late in their journey. For instance, some people may regret buying dividend stocks in their 20s because they saw growth stocks outperform them for more than a decade. On the other hand, other investors may wish they got into dividend stocks in their 40s instead of waiting for their 60s due to market volatility and steep losses from unprofitable investments. Dividend investors shared their thoughts and some advice for people who are considering dividend stocks. Key Points Should you buy dividend stocks in your 20s? Redditors shared their thoughts. Dividend growth stocks make more sense for younger investors, but high-yield stocks become a priority as people get older and approach retirement. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Buy Stocks For The Long Run One of the top comments came from a Walmart (NYSE:WMT) investor who bought shares at $6 apiece and held on to them. The investor now has 1,110 shares and receives an annual dividend that is close to 16% of the initial investment. That&#8217;s the advantage of buying dividend growth stocks. These corporations pay dividends but still have plenty of growth prospects left. Even at its current level of success, Walmart still has growth opportunities. Online advertising, e-commerce, and retail locations are some of the company&#8217;s growth levers. Buying dividend stocks doesn&#8217;t mean you have to be stuck with mature, high-yield companies. For instance, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) has a dividend yield above 1% and has crushed the stock market with a 685% gain over the past five years. Why Wait To Invest? Multiple dividend investors asked why people would wait to invest. Some people said they wished they could invest when they were born, while others wished they invested in their early 20s. People weren&#8217;t expressing regret about entering stocks in their 20s and 30s. Waiting to invest doesn&#8217;t make much sense if you want to become wealthy. The longer you let your money sit in the stock market, the more time you have to compound your returns. Waiting to invest causes your money to lose value due to inflation. A high-yield savings account is better than nothing, but it can&#8217;t appreciate like dividend stocks. You only get the cash flow from a bank account, while dividend stocks can double in value over the course of 5-10 years. Transition To High-Yield Dividend Stocks When You Need Steady Income A few dividend investors said that it makes sense to diversify into high-yield stocks when they need additional income. Many investors focused on dividend growth stocks or index funds that tracked major indices like the S&amp;P 500 when they were younger. Then, they gradually sold off some of those holdings and shifted into funds with lower risk and higher yields. Every person has a different financial situation and long-term goals. If you don&#8217;t need to sell your assets within the next decade and don&#8217;t need dividend income, it may make more sense to focus on growth-oriented opportunities. However, your plans may look different if you want to sell your stocks in 1-3 years to buy a house. Then, it may be better to take a cautious approach and focus on funds that have high yields and steady growth instead of riskier funds that aim to produce 10%+ annualized returns. If you&#8217;re just getting started, you can diversify your portfolio with dividend stocks and growth-oriented stocks. Reinvesting dividends ensures that your dividend income grows over time and can eventually cover your living expenses. Monitoring dividend stocks can help you build a robust portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance.

Key Points The NASDAQ-100 is a volatile index that offers considerable long term upside amidst its intraday turbulence. Use of financial derivatives for both risk mitigation and for potentially larger leveraged gains has become routine in the financial world, especially for QQQI and JEPQ. To qualify as a “Dividend King”, a stock must have a track record of 50 or more consecutive years of dividend increases due to the underlying issuing company’s intrinsic growth. ETF “dividend kings” are metaphorical, but may reference a head to head comparison. Are you ahead or behind on your retirement goals?

Don’t waste another minute – get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Seven of the top largest S&amp;P 500 stocks by market cap are tech industry companies that have been dubbed “The Magnificent 7” due to their remarkable tandem bull run over the past several years. These stocks are:: Apple, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Microsoft, Meta Platforms (Facebook), Nvidia, and Tesla. In order to give better focus on the tech and other higher growth sectors, which tend to be listed on NASDAQ, the NASDAQ-100 index was created to track the top 100 NASDAQ listed companies that are not in the financial sector, as the tech emphasis also purports to emphasize innovation and new products instead of financial companies, which ostensibly do not. The launch of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) that track the NASDAQ-100 index was a foregone conclusion, and several of them already vie for investor dollars on a daily basis. Two that have exhibited sizable growth but have been able to augment their gains in the form of dividends, are: The NEOS Nasdaq-100 High Income ETF (NASDAQ: QQQI), and the JP Morgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ: JEPQ). Ironically, both indexes generate their high yields through strategic innovations that rival those in the tech sector, in terms of their potential to deliver performance enhancements for their assigned tasks. How QQQI and JEPQ Compare &#8211; An Overview Both QQQI and JEPQ track the NASDAQ 1oo ETF, which is very volatile, due to its heavy weighting in the technology sector. Both ETFs are still relatively young. QQQI only launched in January, 2024 and JEPQ began in May, 2022. The following details are based on market price at the time of this writing: Category QQQI JEPQ Yield 14.55% 11.28% Net Assets $1.76 billion $26.27 billion Average Daily Volume 970,269 shares 7.29 million shares Expense Ratio 0.68% 0.35% Beta 0.00 0.83 52-week range 41.17-54.47 44.31-58.54 1-year return 14.37% 7.69% 1-year trailing return 15.24% 8.49% 3-year return n/a 14.40% Largest Hedge Fund Holder Second Half Financial Ptnrs Fisher Asset Mgmt.

Both JEPQ and QQQI utilize option strategies to artificially create dividends for their shareholders. However there are both mechanical and risk/reward differences in their respective approaches. JEPQ uses Equity Linked Notes (ELNs), which are synthetic financial products created by financial institutions, and are linked to a particular index or stock. ELNs usually have a call option attached to a principal protection component, and can be likened to a short-term zero-coupon bond with a maturity of no longer than a few months. The returns on the ELN are linked to the underlying index or stock. Additionally, most, if not all ELNs are purchased directly from the issuer and held to maturity. There is no secondary market for ELNs. JEPQ manager Hamilton Reiner staggers one-month calls into multiple weekly buckets, then diversifies the expiration dates and strike prices. However, Reiner conducts this strategy with purchases of ELNs that give the JEPQ exposure to the profits on those call options, without the risk of any of the top tech stock holdings being subject to calls if the market takes off and the calls go in-the-money. Conversely, QQQI also utilizes a covered call strategy, in addition to out of the money call purchases to augment upside gains. QQQI writes their covered calls directly against the NASDAQ-100 index up to 100% of the equity value of total QQQI holdings. The fund then uses a portion of their covered call premium income to purchase out of the money call options. This give it the following result scenarios: If the market ends relatively flat, QQQI has kept the premium income minus the cost of the out of the money options. If the market jumps up, the underwritten covered call is already hedged against stocks, but QQQI can take profit on the out of the money call that ostensibly would be in the money due to the jump. Overall Analysis and The King of the Hill In This Competition For 1 year&#8217;s yield comparison, QQQI wins the &#8220;King of the Hill&#8221; contest against JEPQ, but has 49 years to go of upping the yield ante annually before being able to claim a &#8220;Dividend King&#8221; title. Selling covered calls is considered a viable strategy to mitigate volatility and take advantage of market volatility, which usually means increased delta and subsequently larger premiums. However, there is a reason why there is a sizable enough market on the buy side &#8211; there are enough people who think the option will increase in value. However, selling calls can limit interim upside, especially if the goal is for the option to expire worthless so the same underlying securities can cover another call writing opportunity next month. President Thomas Jefferson was once quoted, “ With risk comes great reward.” QQQI’s superior yield is a testament to the reward from being more aggressive and taking on more risk than JEPQ. However, with only slightly over 1 years’ worth of trading history and returns from which to judge, QQQI may be the dividend “king of the hill” only for the moment. Whether a consistent track record can be built or not on the QQQI strategy model, which needs to be actively managed by their presumably disciplined managers, remains to be seen. Since both companies’ dividends are artificially created through trading against market volatility, as opposed to intrinsic enhanced value through a business, the ability for JEPQ and QQQI rests solely on skill and knowledge of its managers. If they can first reach Dividend Aristocrat status (25 or more years of consecutive, annual dividend increases), then perhaps a hypothetical Dividend King discussion (50 consecutive years or more of dividend increases) can be had.

The artificial intelligence (AI) industry continues to evolve, but there are worries about a market correction that could significantly impact AI stocks. Investors are seeking fairly priced stocks that still have the potential to continue growing and AI is no longer limited to NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). Those who invested in NVDA at the right moment have already made big gains. But if you’re looking for AI stocks to invest now, you need to be picky. Top AI stocks are either priced at a premium or face high expectations, which offer both risk and opportunities. NVIDIA failed to impress Wall Street with its Q2 earnings. Its data center revenue was slightly below consensus, and it reported a modest quarter. While the stock is up 25% in 2025, it is suffering due to elevated expectations. NVIDIA will continue to dominate the AI industry, but there are three other AI stocks worth loading up on. Here are three leveraged to AI that you should consider instead. --> --> Key Points If you&#8217;re looking for AI stocks other than Nvidia, here are the top three stocks soaring higher this year.

The company has benefited from the increased spending on cloud computing infrastructure and has a partnership with OpenAI. Besides the outsized gains in recent years, Oracle has had an excellent 2025. The company has turned into a complete ecosystem and is no longer restricted to a software database business. It started to build its own cloud services and offers AI powered database services. It also offers software-as-a-service for marketing, automating workflows, financial reporting, and more. A strong player in the cloud business today, Oracle is spending aggressively to capture the market. It reported a revenue of $15.9 billion in its Q4 financial results announced in June. Cloud revenue jumped 27% to $6.7 billion for the quarter, while total revenue for 2025 was up 8% to $57.4 billion. The management is aiming to achieve a 70% revenue growth in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure segment, and it is aiming for the total revenue to increase 16% to $67 billion in FY 2026. Its remaining performance obligations increased 41% to $138 billion. It shows the total value of the company’s unfulfilled contracts at the end of a period. A 41% jump is nothing but impressive. The company is already a part of the massive $500 billion Stargate project. Announced by OpenAI, Oracle, SoftBank and MGX, Oracle is the funder and technology partner. Stargate AI aims to invest $500 billion towards new data centres and infrastructure over the next four years. There’s a lot of space for the stock to show its strength and soar higher. Broadcom Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) supplies custom AI chips to three of the biggest tech giants- Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOGL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and TikTok owner ByteDance. Up 28% year-to-date, the stock is exchanging hands for $297 and has soared 94% in 12 months. The company makes AI and networking chips that ensure efficient and quick movement of data from one server to another. Its fundamentals are strong, and the company has seen a significant improvement in its market cap to $1.36 trillion. In the recent quarter, the AI revenue jumped 46% year-over-year to $4.4 billion, accounting for 30% of the total sales. The company&#8217;s management is aiming to generate $5.1 billion in AI revenue this quarter. Its networking division also benefits from the AI infrastructure demand. As companies continue to set aside billions of dollars for AI, Broadcom’s infrastructure becomes an integral part of their business. The scope of expansion is massive, and Broadcom is making the most of this opportunity. It is sitting at the intersection of custom chips, networking equipment, and integrated systems. While the stock isn’t cheap, it could be worth betting on. The company is set to report results on September 4, and we could see the stock rally. Analysts are bullish on the stock. Oppenheimer analyst has a price target of $325 with an Outperform rating while UBS has a price target of $345 with a Buy rating. AVGO is one of the top tech giants to keep on your radar. CoreWeave A new AI cloud services provider, CoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV), has been making news after the expiration of its IPO lockup period. Up 157% in 2025, CoreWeave stock is exchanging hands for $103 and has reported robust quarterly results. The company has a market cap of $47 billion, and it rents out NVIDIA GPU-equipped servers. A fairly new name in the AI space, the stock has impressed investors, and this could be a start to a solid journey. In 2022, the company spent about $100 million to install Nvidia’s H100 GPU’s in its data centers, and then it used those as collateral to secure funding to open more data centres. The strategy impressed tech giant Nvidia, which invested $100 million in the company in 2023 and another $250 million in the IPO this year. This is NVIDIA&#8217;s single biggest investment in the stock and has garnered attention from many. CoreWeave has 33 data centers in the U.S. and Europe, and top customers include Meta, OpenAI and IBM (NYSE: IBM). The growing expenses have led to wide losses, and analysts expect the company to continue reporting net losses this year. In the recent quarter, it posted a loss of 60 cents per share versus $1.62 per share loss reported a year earlier. CoreWeave saw a 206% jump in revenue to $1.21 billion, beating expectations. For the full year, it has raised guidance by $250 million to $5.25 billion. Unlike bigger AI companies, which offer a range of computing and storage services, CoreWeave only focuses on one service- providing cloud-based GPUs for processing AI tasks. It enjoys an early mover advantage, has an impressive client base, and the potential to grow at a rapid rate.

The AI industry is expected to reach $4.8 trillion by 2023, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. This means AI companies will continue to benefit from the boom and harness the full power of its technology, thus benefiting shareholders. A few large companies have gained tremendous attention due to their massive spikes in value and soaring stock prices. And despite market volatility and tariffs, their valuations have remained elevated. While a rapid rise and stability cannot be predicted, there are a few companies that have remained top industry players for some time now. If you’re looking to build a portfolio of the best tech stocks, read on to learn more about the AI stocks currently carrying the market. --> --> Key Points These three AI stocks have contributed significantly to the market and have more upside ahead.

Don&#8217;t waste another minute; learn more here.(Sponsor) --> --> Palantir Technologies Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ:PLTR) has become the talk of the town in 2025. With a 106% year-to-date gain, the stock is exchanging hands for $154 at the time of writing. However, it is down 18% from its all-time high. The company is in an incredible place to benefit from AI demand and is the best performing stock of the S&amp;P 500 this year. PLTR stock is trading at a premium, and many investors have valuation concerns. But there’s a lot to be excited about. The company reported an impressive second quarter with a 48% year-over-year jump in the top line. It is aggressively expanding in the commercial sector and has seen a 93% jump in the U.S. commercial revenue. It closed 157 deals of at least $1 million and 42 deals of at least $10 million. The U.S. commercial remaining deal value was up 145% year-over-year to $2.79 billion. Driven by the success of its bespoke AI platforms, Palantir is one of the few companies that have demonstrated impressive growth and profitability. It continues to remain a favorite of the federal government and was recently awarded a $10 billion contract with the military. I must mention that Palantir shares have an astronomical valuation. However, it continues to drive the market right now and Wall Street analysts are bullish on the stock with a &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating. NVIDIA Tech giant NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) needs no introduction. The biggest driver of AI growth across the country, NVIDIA has made the most of this thriving market. It has soared to new highs driven by its AI chips and has already delivered double digit gains in 2025. Up 23% year-to-date, the stock is exchanging hands for $170. Once known for setting the gold standard in graphics processing units for the gaming industry, NVIDIA quickly shifted gears and started building GPUs for AI. It is a dominant chip designer, and the numbers are impressive. In the second quarter results, the company reported a revenue of $46.7 billion, up 56% year-over-year, and the data center revenue was $41.1 billion. About 40% of the revenue comes from only two customers. While the company hasn&#8217;t named the customers, it mentioned that one customer represented 23% of the total revenue, while another represented 16% of the revenue. It could be one of the big tech companies heavily relying on Nvidia. For Q3, company management is aiming for revenue of $54 billion. While high concentration on a few customers can present a significant risk, the top tech giants have plenty of cash on hand to spend on AI. As companies increase their AI spending, NVIDIA will continue to benefit. NVIDIA presented at the Goldman Sachs Technology Conference on Sept. 8, and any announcements of new launches could boost the stock. NVIDIA has been carrying the market for a long time now and there’s no other company that can come close to it. It is an irreplaceable company you must add to your portfolio. Taiwan Semiconductor Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (NYSE:TSM) is one stock to buy and hold forever. A major supplier for chip companies like NVIDIA and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), TSMC has also built strong relationships with Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL). The company recently reported results and generated over $30 billion in sales for the quarter. There’s growing demand for its 5nm and 3nm chip nodes, which continue to drive sales. It is sitting at the forefront of chip technology and has recently launched the 2nm chip node. This could indicate higher growth for the company as there will be improvements in 2nm which is why companies are willing to adopt this technology. The company has cut ties to Chinese chipmaking tools and secured additional NVIDIA orders, playing a strategic role in the China-U.S. competition. The world’s largest contract chipmaker, TSMC has fast-tracked its U.S. manufacturing footprint. Production has already begun at its Japan lab, and the management has plans for American expansion this year. Fundamentally, TSMC is in a strong position. It saw a 38% jump in revenue and an improved gross margin. The revenue stood at $30.07 billion and the EPS was $2.50, up 61% year over year. Its market share reached 70%, driven by the growing demand for smartphones, AI accelerators and PCs. This was TMSC’s strongest quarter, and it has gained a position that is hard to beat. Tech giants are increasing their investment in AI, and TSMC will benefit from it. The company is well positioned to capitalize on the growing AI investment and could grab a larger market share in the coming years.
