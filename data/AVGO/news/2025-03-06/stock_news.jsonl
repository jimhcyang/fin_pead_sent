NVDA stock as well as Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) were helped by analysts at Bernstein, who reiterated their &#8220;outperform&#8221; ratings on both stocks, advising investors to pounce on any dip. Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) shares are also popping with a 3.6% gain after yesterday&#8217;s double-digit-percentage drop. President Trump has come out swinging against Tesla boycotters, announcing he would be buying an EV for himself in support of Elon Musk, whose net worth was slashed by $29 billion in yesterday&#8217;s market sell-off.
