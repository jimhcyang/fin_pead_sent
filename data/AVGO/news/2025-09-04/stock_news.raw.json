    "text": "The artificial intelligence (AI) industry continues to evolve, but there are worries about a market correction that could significantly impact AI stocks. Investors are seeking fairly priced stocks that still have the potential to continue growing and AI is no longer limited to NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). Those who invested in NVDA at the right moment have already made big gains. But if you’re looking for AI stocks to invest now, you need to be picky. Top AI stocks are either priced at a premium or face high expectations, which offer both risk and opportunities. NVIDIA failed to impress Wall Street with its Q2 earnings. Its data center revenue was slightly below consensus, and it reported a modest quarter. While the stock is up 25% in 2025, it is suffering due to elevated expectations. NVIDIA will continue to dominate the AI industry, but there are three other AI stocks worth loading up on. Here are three leveraged to AI that you should consider instead. --> --> Key Points If you&#8217;re looking for AI stocks other than Nvidia, here are the top three stocks soaring higher this year. These stocks are up over 20% in 2025 and have the potential to move upwards. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset&#8217;s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don&#8217;t waste another minute; learn more here.(Sponsor) --> --> Oracle Up 36% in 2025, Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) stock is exchanging hands for $226. The company has benefited from the increased spending on cloud computing infrastructure and has a partnership with OpenAI. Besides the outsized gains in recent years, Oracle has had an excellent 2025. The company has turned into a complete ecosystem and is no longer restricted to a software database business. It started to build its own cloud services and offers AI powered database services. It also offers software-as-a-service for marketing, automating workflows, financial reporting, and more. A strong player in the cloud business today, Oracle is spending aggressively to capture the market. It reported a revenue of $15.9 billion in its Q4 financial results announced in June. Cloud revenue jumped 27% to $6.7 billion for the quarter, while total revenue for 2025 was up 8% to $57.4 billion. The management is aiming to achieve a 70% revenue growth in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure segment, and it is aiming for the total revenue to increase 16% to $67 billion in FY 2026. Its remaining performance obligations increased 41% to $138 billion. It shows the total value of the company’s unfulfilled contracts at the end of a period. A 41% jump is nothing but impressive. The company is already a part of the massive $500 billion Stargate project. Announced by OpenAI, Oracle, SoftBank and MGX, Oracle is the funder and technology partner. Stargate AI aims to invest $500 billion towards new data centres and infrastructure over the next four years. There’s a lot of space for the stock to show its strength and soar higher. Broadcom Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) supplies custom AI chips to three of the biggest tech giants- Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOGL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and TikTok owner ByteDance. Up 28% year-to-date, the stock is exchanging hands for $297 and has soared 94% in 12 months. The company makes AI and networking chips that ensure efficient and quick movement of data from one server to another. Its fundamentals are strong, and the company has seen a significant improvement in its market cap to $1.36 trillion. In the recent quarter, the AI revenue jumped 46% year-over-year to $4.4 billion, accounting for 30% of the total sales. The company&#8217;s management is aiming to generate $5.1 billion in AI revenue this quarter. Its networking division also benefits from the AI infrastructure demand. As companies continue to set aside billions of dollars for AI, Broadcom’s infrastructure becomes an integral part of their business. The scope of expansion is massive, and Broadcom is making the most of this opportunity. It is sitting at the intersection of custom chips, networking equipment, and integrated systems. While the stock isn’t cheap, it could be worth betting on. The company is set to report results on September 4, and we could see the stock rally. Analysts are bullish on the stock. Oppenheimer analyst has a price target of $325 with an Outperform rating while UBS has a price target of $345 with a Buy rating. AVGO is one of the top tech giants to keep on your radar. CoreWeave A new AI cloud services provider, CoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV), has been making news after the expiration of its IPO lockup period. Up 157% in 2025, CoreWeave stock is exchanging hands for $103 and has reported robust quarterly results. The company has a market cap of $47 billion, and it rents out NVIDIA GPU-equipped servers. A fairly new name in the AI space, the stock has impressed investors, and this could be a start to a solid journey. In 2022, the company spent about $100 million to install Nvidia’s H100 GPU’s in its data centers, and then it used those as collateral to secure funding to open more data centres. The strategy impressed tech giant Nvidia, which invested $100 million in the company in 2023 and another $250 million in the IPO this year. This is NVIDIA&#8217;s single biggest investment in the stock and has garnered attention from many. CoreWeave has 33 data centers in the U.S. and Europe, and top customers include Meta, OpenAI and IBM (NYSE: IBM). The growing expenses have led to wide losses, and analysts expect the company to continue reporting net losses this year. In the recent quarter, it posted a loss of 60 cents per share versus $1.62 per share loss reported a year earlier. CoreWeave saw a 206% jump in revenue to $1.21 billion, beating expectations. For the full year, it has raised guidance by $250 million to $5.25 billion. Unlike bigger AI companies, which offer a range of computing and storage services, CoreWeave only focuses on one service- providing cloud-based GPUs for processing AI tasks. It enjoys an early mover advantage, has an impressive client base, and the potential to grow at a rapid rate.

    "text": "The AI industry is expected to reach $4.8 trillion by 2023, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. This means AI companies will continue to benefit from the boom and harness the full power of its technology, thus benefiting shareholders. A few large companies have gained tremendous attention due to their massive spikes in value and soaring stock prices. And despite market volatility and tariffs, their valuations have remained elevated. While a rapid rise and stability cannot be predicted, there are a few companies that have remained top industry players for some time now. If you’re looking to build a portfolio of the best tech stocks, read on to learn more about the AI stocks currently carrying the market. --> --> Key Points These three AI stocks have contributed significantly to the market and have more upside ahead. As companies continue to set aside billions for AI, these stocks are set to benefit. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement?

Don&#8217;t waste another minute; learn more here.(Sponsor) --> --> Palantir Technologies Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ:PLTR) has become the talk of the town in 2025. With a 106% year-to-date gain, the stock is exchanging hands for $154 at the time of writing. However, it is down 18% from its all-time high. The company is in an incredible place to benefit from AI demand and is the best performing stock of the S&amp;P 500 this year. PLTR stock is trading at a premium, and many investors have valuation concerns. But there’s a lot to be excited about. The company reported an impressive second quarter with a 48% year-over-year jump in the top line. It is aggressively expanding in the commercial sector and has seen a 93% jump in the U.S. commercial revenue. It closed 157 deals of at least $1 million and 42 deals of at least $10 million. The U.S. commercial remaining deal value was up 145% year-over-year to $2.79 billion. Driven by the success of its bespoke AI platforms, Palantir is one of the few companies that have demonstrated impressive growth and profitability. It continues to remain a favorite of the federal government and was recently awarded a $10 billion contract with the military. I must mention that Palantir shares have an astronomical valuation. However, it continues to drive the market right now and Wall Street analysts are bullish on the stock with a &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating. NVIDIA Tech giant NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) needs no introduction. The biggest driver of AI growth across the country, NVIDIA has made the most of this thriving market. It has soared to new highs driven by its AI chips and has already delivered double digit gains in 2025. Up 23% year-to-date, the stock is exchanging hands for $170. Once known for setting the gold standard in graphics processing units for the gaming industry, NVIDIA quickly shifted gears and started building GPUs for AI. It is a dominant chip designer, and the numbers are impressive. In the second quarter results, the company reported a revenue of $46.7 billion, up 56% year-over-year, and the data center revenue was $41.1 billion. About 40% of the revenue comes from only two customers. While the company hasn&#8217;t named the customers, it mentioned that one customer represented 23% of the total revenue, while another represented 16% of the revenue. It could be one of the big tech companies heavily relying on Nvidia. For Q3, company management is aiming for revenue of $54 billion. While high concentration on a few customers can present a significant risk, the top tech giants have plenty of cash on hand to spend on AI. As companies increase their AI spending, NVIDIA will continue to benefit. NVIDIA presented at the Goldman Sachs Technology Conference on Sept. 8, and any announcements of new launches could boost the stock. NVIDIA has been carrying the market for a long time now and there’s no other company that can come close to it. It is an irreplaceable company you must add to your portfolio. Taiwan Semiconductor Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (NYSE:TSM) is one stock to buy and hold forever. A major supplier for chip companies like NVIDIA and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), TSMC has also built strong relationships with Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL). The company recently reported results and generated over $30 billion in sales for the quarter. There’s growing demand for its 5nm and 3nm chip nodes, which continue to drive sales. It is sitting at the forefront of chip technology and has recently launched the 2nm chip node. This could indicate higher growth for the company as there will be improvements in 2nm which is why companies are willing to adopt this technology. The company has cut ties to Chinese chipmaking tools and secured additional NVIDIA orders, playing a strategic role in the China-U.S. competition. The world’s largest contract chipmaker, TSMC has fast-tracked its U.S. manufacturing footprint. Production has already begun at its Japan lab, and the management has plans for American expansion this year. Fundamentally, TSMC is in a strong position. It saw a 38% jump in revenue and an improved gross margin. The revenue stood at $30.07 billion and the EPS was $2.50, up 61% year over year. Its market share reached 70%, driven by the growing demand for smartphones, AI accelerators and PCs. This was TMSC’s strongest quarter, and it has gained a position that is hard to beat. Tech giants are increasing their investment in AI, and TSMC will benefit from it. The company is well positioned to capitalize on the growing AI investment and could grab a larger market share in the coming years.
