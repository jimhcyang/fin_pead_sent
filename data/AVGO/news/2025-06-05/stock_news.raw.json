    "text": "Key Points The SH and PSQ ETFs provide simple inverse exposure to major U.S. market indexes. For bearish-leaning risk takers, the SPXS ETF offers powerful leverage when the S&amp;P 500 declines. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) The first quarter of this year reminded optimistic investors that stocks don&#8217;t only go up. Trade war tensions, recession worries, and other factors could spur a market crash in 2025. Instead of using fancy strategies like short-selling stocks or buying put options, there&#8217;s an easier way that doesn&#8217;t require a margin account. Bearish-leaning investors can profit from a stock market crash of 20% or more by owning inverse exchange traded funds (ETFs). These funds are specifically designed to gain value when a stock market index, such as the S&amp;P 500 or the NASDAQ 100, goes down. There are risks involved, to be sure, but the following three inverse ETFs could set you up for powerful returns if the market craters. ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 (SH) The S&amp;P 500 is a commonly cited stock index that represents a broad selection of large-cap U.S.-focused companies. Therefore, a simple way to profit from a stock market crash would be to hold an inverse ETF that gains value when the S&amp;P 500 collapses. ProShares offers an ETF that serves this exact purpose. It&#8217;s a fund called the ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:SH), and it seeks to move inversely to the daily performance of the S&amp;P 500. What&#8217;s good about moving inversely to the S&amp;P 500 is that it&#8217;s usually a slower-moving index than the NASDAQ 100. Therefore, the ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF should carry less risk than some other inverse ETFs. Remember, the S&amp;P 500 comprises a broad range of stocks from multiple market sectors. Some S&amp;P 500 component stocks include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), Abbvie (NYSE:ABBV), Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), and Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM). Thus, you&#8217;re actually achieving what I call &#8220;inverse diversification&#8221; with the SH ETF. Even with the somewhat de-risking effect of &#8220;inverse diversification,&#8221; the ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF could gain value quickly if there&#8217;s a stock market crash. Be aware, though, that the SH ETF won&#8217;t necessarily move up at the exact same pace that the S&amp;P 500 goes down. That&#8217;s because the ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF inversely tracks the S&amp;P 500 throughout the day but then resets and rebalances the next day. As ProShares explains, &#8220;For any holding period other than a day, your return may be higher or lower than the Daily Target [i.e., the S&amp;P 500]. These differences may be significant.&#8221; To put it another way, you&#8217;ll get faithful inverse S&amp;P 500 tracking for a day with the SH ETF. However, the longer you hold the fund, the more the results can vary from what you might expect. Consequently, while the ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF would probably make you money during a market crash, it&#8217;s not meant to be held for too long. ProShares Short QQQ (PSQ) If you&#8217;re willing to accept more risk, consider that the NASDAQ 100 mostly covers only one market sector (technology) and only includes around 100 stocks (as opposed to around 500 stocks in the more diversified S&amp;P 500). So, an ETF that inversely tracks the NASDAQ 100 is somewhat riskier but could yield greater rewards in the event of a market crash. To that end, you might consider the ProShares Short QQQ ETF (NYSEARCA:PSQ). This fund inversely corresponds to the daily performance of the NASDAQ 100 index. Bear in mind that the NASDAQ 100 is mainly focused on technology sector stocks, such as Apple, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). You won&#8217;t get as much &#8220;inverse diversification&#8221; with the ProShares Short QQQ ETF as you would get with the ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF, but you could potentially achieve greater returns during a market crash with the PSQ ETF. Much like with the ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF, the ProShares Short QQQ ETF is subject to unexpected results if you hold the fund for longer than a day. Hence, I&#8217;ll send out a similar warning: even if the stock market is collapsing, don&#8217;t hold the PSQ ETF for too long because the risks will probably increase over time. Direxion Daily S&amp;P 500 Bear 3X Shares ETF (SPXS) My third entry for the best inverse ETFs to profit in a market crash is the Direxion Daily S&amp;P 500 Bear 3X Shares ETF (NYSEARCA:SPXS). This, like the SH ETF, may be somewhat de-risked because it inversely tracks the S&amp;P 500 and has &#8220;inverse diversification.&#8221; However, the SPXS ETF is still the riskiest fund on this list. What makes the Direxion Daily S&amp;P 500 Bear 3X Shares ETF so high-risk and potentially high-reward is that the fund is inverse and triple-leveraged. This means that the SPXS ETF, on a daily basis, moves three times as fast as the S&amp;P 500, but in the opposite direction. In theory, you might assume that the Direxion Daily S&amp;P 500 Bear 3X Shares ETF would go up 60% if the S&amp;P 500 goes down 20%. Again, however, there&#8217;s no assurance of faithful index tracking beyond one day. Hence, you could get highly unexpected results if you hold the Direxion Daily S&amp;P 500 Bear 3X Shares ETF for a long time. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s probably too risky to hold the SPXS ETF for more than a couple of weeks, even during a stock market crash. Besides, if the stock market suddenly rallies, the Direxion Daily S&amp;P 500 Bear 3X Shares ETF could make a triple-magnified move to the downside. The point is that the SPXS ETF is for nimble, sniper-like traders who can get into and out of a position quickly. If you prefer to take on less risk, consider the non-leveraged ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF or ProShares Short QQQ ETF.The post 3 Best Inverse ETFs to Profit in a Market Crash appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",

    "text": "Risk tolerance is a very subjective topic. It is a necessary qualifying component of the KYC (Know Your Customer) protocols for financial professionals, and is implemented to establish levels of investment risk that a new customer is comfortable taking. While the ideal investment delivers big capital appreciation and AAA principal safety, the maxim “no guts no glory” applies also to investing, where the largest returns are generally the ones that are the riskiest ventures. Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) are a popular vehicle for diversified investments, as they can be bought and sold online with ease and are usually subject to lower fees than mutual funds. ETFs come in a wide range of configurations, and are generally passively managed and designed to mimic the performance of designated market indexes. Key Points Dividend growth, in the majority of cases, is a stock indicator of a company’s business success, since dividend growth usually is commensurate with profit growth. The Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund ETF is a popular ETF platform for investors to avail themselves of blue chip companies with a steady track record for both dividend increases and price appreciation growth. Deployment of a dividend reinvestment protocol can substantially boost overall ROI for investments in an ETF such as Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund ETF.

Each advisor has been carefully vetted to analyze your needs and advise actions to best achieve your portfolio goals with your best interests in mind. Don’t waste another minute – get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) For those investors who have found the S&amp;P 500 Index too volatile for their liking, there is another index that offers steady growth, albeit at a slower pace, combined with a strong income component and lower volatility. The S&amp;P U.S. Dividend Growers Index is one such benchmark. Containing Dividend Kings (50 or more consecutive years of increased dividends) and Dividend Aristocrats (25 or more years in a row of increased dividends), this index contains Fortune 500 companies whose businesses are historically profitable enough that they can afford to continue higher dividend payouts year after year. The Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund ETF (NYSE: VIG) is a popular ETF with a portfolio reflecting this exact index. Founded in 2006, the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund ETF strives for a mix of capital appreciation and income from dividend growth companies, i.e. those with a history of dividend increases accompanying growth. Its yield is 1.87% and it has a 0.05% expense ratio. The dividend increases have to be consistent for a minimum of 10 years to warrant inclusion. Surprisingly, the top 25% companies with the highest yields are excluded from the 330+ stocks on the VIG roster. VIG has a Morningstar gold ETF ranking. It had $101.79 billion assets under management (AUM) as of the time of this writing. A look at VIG’s top 10 holdings shows how its criteria differ from S&amp;P 500 Index ETFs, which are usually led by Magnificent 7 stocks, based on market cap size: Broadcom Microsoft Apple Eli Lilly JP Morgan Chase Visa, Inc. Exxon Mobil MasterCard Costco Wholesale Walmart The VIG Dividend Difference As the calculator demonstrates, a $15,000 investment in VIG back in January, 2020 would be worth $25,833.91 today, at the time of this writing, which equates to a 72.23% ROI. The total return would be $10,833.91. The annualized return equates to 10.62%. This calculation also includes compounding through reinvested dividends. The reinvested dividend value is $2,425.58. The actual cash dividends paid out from the initial 119.67 shares equates to $1,849.45. If the dividends are not reinvested, the total return would be $8,408.33. Therefore, reinvesting the dividends enabled an additional return differential of $2,425.58 over the 5 year span. The Dividend Reinvestment Advantage For Safer Returns Dividend stocks with annual payout growth can boost capital appreciation through compounding, or provide extra income in the case of emergencies. As the charts demonstrate, reinvesting dividends contributed a 22% boost to ROI, while overall capital appreciation growth still averaged over 10% annually. Dividend Reinvestment Programs (DRIP) can automatically implement purchases of additional shares without additional fees or order entries, if one is so inclined. In the case of an ETF such as VIG, investors with weaker stomachs for volatility can sleep more easily, knowing that their portfolios are still growing albeit without the roller coaster ride delivered by Nvidia, for example. Another plus to VIG is that since it contains both current and potential future Dividend King and Dividend Aristocrat stocks, the dividend amounts will continue to grow with each passing year. This will, in turn, increase the amount of additional shares that can be obtained under a DRIP agreement. This is a classic compounding model for health building that can work for the benefit of many investors. On the contingency side, the investor can always cancel the DRIP agreement if there is an emergency need for the dividend income pending, since it can always be renewed at a later date after the crisis has passed.

    "site": "https://247wallst.com",
    "text": "Key Points QQQI, JEPQ, SPYI, and MSTY offer eye-catching yields for ambitious passive income investors. You can try all four of these high-yield ETFs for diversified exposure to a wide range of stocks. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) In recent years, ultra-high-yield exchange traded funds (ETFs) have opened the door to new possibilities for aggressive income harvesters. If you pick your ETFs carefully, you can practically turn your portfolio into a passive income machine. Using high-yield ETFs to generate steady income is a smart strategy, but it takes time and research to build a reliable income machine. So, to save you some of the trouble, I&#8217;ve hand-picked these four fantastic funds with big yields. Furthermore, if you give these four ETFs a try, you can cover different market sectors to diversify your portfolio. NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF (QQQI) If you&#8217;re on the hunt for tech-sector exposure, big yield, and frequent payouts, look no further. Truly, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF (NASDAQ:QQQI) is an ambitious income investor&#8217;s dream fund. First and foremost, the QQQI ETF offers a huge distribution yield (i.e., the annualized cash payout to your portfolio) of 13.92%. This positions the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF among the most generous high-yield funds available today. Plus, there&#8217;s another reason why the QQQI ETF is a dividend achiever. Specifically, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF pays its cash distributions on a monthly basis instead of making you wait three months for the next payout. Granted, you&#8217;ll have to pay an expense ratio, which is the annualized management fee that&#8217;s automatically deducted from the fund&#8217;s share price. When it comes to the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF, the expense ratio is 0.68%, which is slightly high but not outrageous. Just as importantly, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF invests in components of the technology-heavy NASDAQ 100 index. With roughly 100 holdings, the QQQI ETF includes well-established tech winners like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). In other words, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF isn&#8217;t only a passive income powerhouse with a sizable yield. It&#8217;s also an easy way to diversify your portfolio across dozens of tech-market standouts, and this can add an extra layer of safety. JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPQ) In some ways, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:JEPQ) is similar to the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF. Yet, with the JEPQ ETF you&#8217;ll get the peace of mind that comes with prestigious management from financial giant JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). Like the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF focuses on the NASDAQ 100. JEPQ has 108 stocks in its holdings, and the fund is strongly weighted toward large-cap technology stocks (Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and so on). Also, just like the QQQI ETF, the JEPQ ETF pays out its distributions on a monthly basis. However, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF has a rolling 12-month dividend yield of 11.01%, which isn&#8217;t quite as high as the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF&#8217;s gigantic 13.92% distribution yield. On the other hand, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF brings you active management from the one and only JPMorgan Chase. That&#8217;s a safety feature to consider, and the fund&#8217;s expense ratio is only 0.35%. Therefore, you might consider leveraging the expertise of a legendary asset manager with the comparatively low-fee JEPQ ETF. NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF (SPYI) Mind you, I didn&#8217;t turn my portfolio into a passive income machine by only investing in NASDAQ 100 based funds. Indeed, I diversified my holdings even further with a very broad-based fund known as the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF (BATS:SPYI). Like QQQI and JEPQ, SPYI pays out its distributions each and every month. Yet, unlike those other two funds, the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF is based on the S&amp;P 500 rather than the NASDAQ 100. With around 500 stocks in its holdings, the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF is more diversified than QQQI and JEPQ. You&#8217;ll get exposure to tech names like Apple and NVIDIA with the SPYI ETF, but you&#8217;ll also participate in the growth of non-technology-sector businesses like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). For active management and the enhanced safety that comes with wide portfolio breadth, the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF charges an expense ratio of 0.68%. However, the fund&#8217;s hefty 12.11% annual distribution rate more than makes up for the management fees, so SPYI is a great choice for monthly income seekers. YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF (MSTY) Finally, after focusing on safety and diversification with the first three ETFs, now we can ramp up the risk-and-reward profile with a fourth fund. I&#8217;m referring to an aggressive but fascinating fund known as the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:MSTY). You won&#8217;t get much diversification with the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF. Instead, you&#8217;ll get an annual expense ratio of 0.99% and an eye-watering distribution rate of 143.11%. The fund achieves this through actively trading U.S. Treasury bonds and options on Microstrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) stock. As you may be aware, Microstrategy stock is volatile and involves a great deal of risk. You&#8217;ll get sizable monthly distributions with MSTY, but a downturn in MSTR stock could be problematic for your portfolio. Because this fund is very risky, my passive income machine only includes a few shares of the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF. For a more favorable safety-and-yield mix, consider taking a larger position in SPYI, a smaller stake in QQQI and JEPQ, and a tiny position in MSTY.The post These 4 Dividend ETFs (QQQI, JEPQ, SPYI, MSTY) Are Passive Income Machines appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",

    "text": "Key Points A &#8220;more is better&#8221; approach can help you diversify your portfolio while generating passive income. Five fascinating funds will tempt income seekers with potent yields and strong growth prospects. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Stock picking is fine, but exchange traded funds (ETFs) can enable immediate diversification without sacrificing growth and income opportunities. By selecting multiple funds instead of just one, you can achieve an extra measure of safety while also turning your portfolio into a veritable income-generating machine. The idea is to pick out ETFs with notable distribution yields (i.e., annualized cash payment percentages), but also to focus on a wide variety of funds with share-price growth potential. Now, let&#8217;s drill down on five fabulous ETFs so you can start accumulating shares for your income-machine portfolio today. NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF (QQQI) The name of the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF (NASDAQ:QQQI) might lead you to assume that this fund only offers a hefty yield. There&#8217;s more to the story, though, as the QQQI ETF also enables investors to participate in strong technology-focused growth opportunities. Based on the NASDAQ 100 stock index with approximately 100 holdings, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF includes many large-cap tech names you&#8217;ll surely recognize. Some examples are NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). There&#8217;s no denying that technology giants like Apple and NVIDIA are robust revenue generators. Consequently, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF share price could grow substantially over the long term. At the same time, many investors flock to the QQQI ETF for its eye-catching 13.92% distribution yield. Granted, the fund subtracts an annualized management fee (also known as the expense ratio) of 0.68% from the share price. Still, even after the expense ratio is taken out, investors can look forward to outstanding annual income with the QQQI ETF. Along with that, you&#8217;ll get to participate in the growth prospects of terrific tech titans when you hold the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF. JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPQ) There&#8217;s another passive income machine that&#8217;s similar to QQQI, but it&#8217;s not identical. Brought to you by famous financier JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:JEPQ) squeezes extra income from a range of high-confidence technology leaders. Much like the QQQI ETF, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF focuses on the NASDAQ 100 and includes around 100 stocks (108, to be exact). From Microsoft to Apple, Amazon, and many more, you&#8217;ll find plenty of high-growth tech names in JEPQ. There&#8217;s a trade-off with the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF when compared to the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF. On the negative side, JEPQ has a rolling 12-month dividend yield of 11.01%, which isn’t as impressive as QQQI&#8217;s 13.92% distribution yield. On the positive side, however, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF has an annualized expense ratio of 0.35%. This is lower than the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF&#8217;s 0.68% annual management fee. Perhaps most importantly, you&#8217;ll have the reassurance that comes with well-established fund management by JPMorgan Chase. Thus, for an interesting alternative to the QQQI ETF, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF is absolutely worth considering. Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) Maybe you&#8217;re seeking a passive income machine that&#8217;s not as technology-heavy as QQQI and JEPQ. In that case, you&#8217;ll want to check out the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHD). This fund includes has 103 stocks in its portfolio, but SCHD doesn&#8217;t track the NASDAQ 100 index. Instead, the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index. Take a look at the fund’s top 10 holdings and you’ll find some technology firms, such as Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN). Yet, you&#8217;ll also see names from other sectors, including Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and Conoco Phillips (NYSE:COP). Moreover, the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF offers a trailing 12-month distribution yield of 3.72% with an annual expense ratio of just 0.06%. The ultra-low management fees allow investors to grow their accounts steadily with the SCHD ETF. Two More Picks for Low Volatility To cap off this list of passive income machine picks, I&#8217;ve got two relatively low-risk funds to show you. First, there&#8217;s an ETF that concentrates on dividend-growing businesses instead of gigantic yield. The Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF (NYSEARCA:DIVO) features a 4.81% annual distribution rate but also a 0.56% expense ratio, so the income opportunities are good but not jaw-dropping. On the other hand, DIVO tends to be low-volatility as it holds a diverse array of safe names, such as Home Depot, Visa (NYSE:V), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), Microsoft, and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). The Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF emphasizes &#8220;high-quality large cap companies with a history of dividend and earnings growth.&#8221; This approach will typically reduce share-price volatility, so investors can sleep well at night while collecting passive income with DIVO. In a similar vein, the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF (BATS:SPYI) is de-risked because it holds well-known large-cap stocks in multiple sectors. Indeed, SPYI might be the least risky fund on this list as it includes approximately 500 stocks in its holdings. Because the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF generates income from the S&amp;P 500 index, it is a widely diversified fund. So, there&#8217;s a safety factor built into the SPYI ETF. In addition, the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF is an enticing passive income machine with a 12.11% annual distribution rate. The fund&#8217;s 0.68% annual expense ratio isn&#8217;t super-low, but the fees may be justified as SPYI brings high yield and instant diversification to the table. All in all, I like DIVO and SPYI for reduced volatility, SCHD for low management fees, and QQQI and JEPQ for technology-sector exposure.The post These 5 ETFs (QQQI, JEPQ, SCHD, DIVO, SPYI) Are Passive Income Machines appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",

Wall Street Bullish on This Big Tech Stock 9:57 am by Gerelyn Terzo Wall Street analysts have turned increasingly bullish on Amazon stock. Here&#8217;s a roundup of the most recent analyst moves: Earlier this week, BofA reiterated a Buy rating on AMZN and raised its price target from $230 to $248. The analysts highlighted Amazon’s advancements in robotics and AI, noting these could add approximately 2 percentage points to retail margins, supporting further upside. JPMorgan maintained an Overweight rating and increased its price target from $225 to $240. The firm emphasized Amazon’s leadership in e-commerce and Amazon Web Services (AWS), along with margin tailwinds and a strong free cash flow (FCF) ramp, fueling a bullish long-term outlook. Barclays reiterated an Overweight rating with a price target of $240, noting that delays in Amazon’s Project Kuiper (satellite internet initiative) are expected and priced into the stock. They expressed confidence in Amazon’s 2025 launch cadence and cost guidance for the project. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets remain fickle, but today there is reason to be optimistic. Discussions have reemerged between the White House and Beijing, according to Chinese media reports. This has revived the &#8216;risk-on&#8217; trade and sent major stock market indices higher across the board. In a last-ditch effort, officials from both sides are trying to salvage trade talks that had previously stalled. Sectors of the economy are mixed today, with no clear conviction in either direction. Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) has been capturing attention lately, most recently for announcing a $10 billion bet on AI-powered data centers in North Carolina. The stock is up 1.7% today. Additionally, the markets are keeping an eye on the broader S&amp;P 500 index, which will announce changes to its member lineup on Friday. Bank of America has offered its two cents, suggesting that AppLovin (Nasdaq: APP) and Carvana (NYSE: CVNA) could muscle their way into the index. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 60.49 (+0.14%) Nasdaq Composite: 72.99 (+0.38%) S&amp;P 500: Up 16.85 (+0.28%) Market Movers In a bullish move for Big Tech, analyst firm Daiwa has reiterated its &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating on Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) stock, lifting the price target to $165 per share, reflecting upside potential of 17%. Separately, Bank of America analysts reemphasized NVDA stock as one of their top picks with a $180 price objective, saying it&#8217;s in the best spot to capture the benefits of the &#8220;AI tide.&#8221; Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) is losing close to 5% today after Elon Musk turned his attention to the U.S. tax bill. Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) will release its quarterly results after the closing bell today. The stock is trading slightly lower this morning. Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE: PG), a Dow component, is down 1.4% after revealing massive layoffs to the tune of 7,000 jobs amid a wider corporate restructuring.

The markets remain unpredictable, and today is no exception. After starting out of the gate higher on trade talk hopes, stocks have since erased those gains. According to Chinese state media, talks have resumed between the White House and Beijing. In a final push, officials from both nations are attempting to rescue stalled trade negotiations. This appeared to have reignited the &#8220;risk-on&#8221; sentiment, but the markets have since taken a nosedive. Economic sectors are showing mixed signals today, lacking a decisive direction.

Separately, Bank of America analysts reiterated NVDA stock as a top selection with a $180 price objective, stating it&#8217;s ideally positioned to ride the &#8220;AI tide.&#8221; Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) is down nearly 5% today after Elon Musk commented on the U.S. tax bill. Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) is set to release its quarterly earnings after the market closes today. The stock is trading marginally lower this morning.

    "text": "Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Rubrik the Rare Winner Tonight 5:04 pm by Joel South Tonight&#8217;s most anticipated earnings have generally been dreary. Lululemon is down 22%, DocuSign down 16%, and Broadcom is down 4%. So, perhaps its not surprising that after initial gains of 6%, shares of Rubrick are now flat after-hours as of 5:05 p.m. ET. The company still has its earnings call, but after a furious rally in stocks across the past two months, expectations for earnings have clearly risen. Shares Surge on Strong Earnings 4:34 pm by Joel South Shares of RBRK soared in after-hours trading after reporting strong Q1 results. The stock is up 6.02% since the close. Rubrik kicked off its FY 2026 with impressive Q1 results, exceeding all guided metrics and showcasing strong growth across key areas. The cyber resilience company reported a 49% year-over-year revenue increase to $278.5 million and a 38% rise in subscription annual recurring revenue (ARR) to $1.18 billion. The company now has 2,381 customers generating over $100K in subscription ARR, up 28% from the prior year. CEO Bipul Sinha credited the results to focused innovation and execution, while CFO Kiran Choudary highlighted ongoing progress toward profitability. Non-GAAP gross margin improved to 80.5%, and free cash flow turned positive at $33.3 million. Rubrik also announced major partnerships with Google Cloud, Deloitte, NTT Data and Rackspace to expand its data protection and AI security offerings. Looking ahead, Rubrik projects Q2 revenue between $281 million and $283 million and expects full-year revenue to reach up to $1.19 billion. Risks 3:32 pm 1. Channel Saturation and GTM Efficiency PressureRubrik is scaling fast, but sales and marketing spend remains high. If CAC payback extends or sales cycles elongate — especially in regulated verticals — investors may question whether the growth is too expensive. High cash burn without operating leverage risks a rerating, even if ARR expands. 2. Competitive Intensity and Pricing RiskRubrik competes with Veeam, Cohesity, and emerging vendors — many with lower-cost backup offerings. While Rubrik has positioned itself as a premium, AI-native cyber recovery platform, pricing pressure could emerge in mid-market deals or renewals. Any sign of discounting or ASP compression would undercut gross margin confidence. 3. Reliance on Cloud PartnershipsRubrik’s Microsoft and AWS integrations are strengths — but also dependencies. If those partners pivot product strategy, shift co-selling alignment, or prioritize their own tools, Rubrik’s funnel could be disrupted. Partner fatigue or shifting incentives are execution risks not fully priced in. 4. IPO Transition and Reporting ScrutinyAs a newly public company, Rubrik must now meet the rigor of quarterly financial scrutiny. Any inconsistency in disclosure, slippage in RPO, or misalignment between growth and margin could trigger outsized stock reactions. Execution discipline — not just topline growth — will define Rubrik’s post-IPO multiple. Keys to Watch 3:31 pm 1. ARR Growth Trajectory and Large Deal MixWith ~$784M in ARR entering Q1, the Street expects Rubrik to exit FY25 on a ~$1B ARR run-rate. Key to this is continued growth in $1M+ ARR customers and large enterprise wins. Investors will be looking for sequential adds in that cohort, as well as commentary on deal cycles and retention. 2. Microsoft Partnership ActivationRubrik’s GTM alignment with Microsoft — particularly around Azure and Office 365 data protection — is seen as a key differentiator. This quarter, investors want evidence that joint field activity is translating to pipeline conversion, particularly in mid-market and public sector verticals. Deal attribution commentary will be closely parsed. 3. Gross Margin Stability and Product ExpansionLast reported gross margin was 78%, among the highest in SaaS. If this holds or improves, it supports the long-term model of Rubrik as a profitable security platform. Management may offer commentary on adoption of new SKUs — including sensitive data classification and policy automation tools — which could lift ASP and reduce churn. 4. RPO Conversion and Billing PatternsRubrik’s RPO grew 55% YoY last reported, and Q1 is expected to show how much of that is converting to near-term revenue. Investors will track deferred revenue build and renewal velocity to assess whether the business is front-loaded or recurring. Clean billings execution would reinforce ARR confidence. Consensus Estimates 3:30 pm Q1 FY2025 Street Estimates: Revenue: $187.2M (+38% YoY) Adjusted EPS: –$0.33 Gross Margin: ~78% Adj. EBITDA: –$32.4M ARR (prior disclosed): $784M Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO): $811M Growth Metrics to Watch: $1M+ ARR Customers: 117 last reported (+66% YoY) Net Revenue Retention: ~120% Multi-product adoption rate: &gt;50% The Street expects Rubrik to sustain strong revenue momentum into Q2, with guide implications pointing to $200M+ quarterly run-rate before year-end. Analysts are looking for updates to customer count, upsell trends, and vertical-specific traction, particularly in public sector, healthcare, and regulated industries. Cash burn will remain elevated — EBITDA losses are expected near $30M+ — but the focus is on narrowing those losses quarter over quarter while maintaining high ARR expansion and multi-product attach rates. Any progress toward FCF breakeven or improved CAC payback would be viewed as a sign of operational maturity. Rubrik enters its first earnings release as a public company with significant expectations baked into its valuation and narrative. The cybersecurity and data resilience platform is positioned as a high-growth, cloud-native alternative to legacy backup and recovery vendors — and the Street is watching closely to see whether that pitch holds up under public scrutiny. Consensus expects $187.2M in revenue (+38% YoY) and an adjusted EPS loss of –$0.33, sharply improved from –$1.58 YoY. The quarter will test Rubrik’s ability to maintain hypergrowth while narrowing losses and will serve as the first checkpoint for public market investors to evaluate execution quality, GTM leverage, and forward ARR visibility. Management previously disclosed ARR of $784M and 55% YoY growth in RPO. This quarter is expected to show continued traction in large enterprise deals — especially those tied to Microsoft cloud workloads. A key test will be whether customers adopting Rubrik Security Cloud are scaling usage and adding modules such as threat detection, compliance auditing, and ransomware response automation. Given Rubrik’s premium valuation and compressed FCF profile, execution on both growth and efficiency must be crisp. Investors will seek signals that sales productivity is improving, gross margins remain near 78%, and that runway remains long even as growth decelerates modestly from IPO-era acceleration.

    "text": "Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Conference Call is Starting Now 5:07 pm by Joel South Broadcom&#8217;s conference call is starting now. You can listen in here if you&#8217;d like. The stock is currently down 3.4%. However, it&#8217;s worth noting that almost every major stock reporting tonight is seeing red after-hours. Lululemon is down 22%, DocuSign is down 16%, and Rubrik jumped 6% after its earnings were released. However, its shares are now flat. Translation: After a furious two-month stock market rally, investors expectations for what companies should be delivering has risen. If any material news impacts Broadcom&#8217;s share price during its conference call we&#8217;ll post an update. One Standout Figure from Broadcom&#039;s Earnings 4:41 pm by Eric Bleeker One figure to pay attention to is that Broadcom is guiding to AI revenue next quarter of $5.1 billion, that&#8217;s above Wall Street&#8217;s expectations of $4.8 billion. Keep in mind that Broadcom&#8217;s stock has moved significantly in recent quarters based on conference call commentary, so where it&#8217;s trading right now (-2.5%) could be very different than where it opens tomorrow if the company&#8217;s CEO gives some especially bullish comments about future AI demand. It&#039;s a Beat and Raise for Broadcom - So Why Aren&#039;t Shares Moving? 4:37 pm by Joel South Broadcom issued a beat and raise for tonight&#8217;s earnings, not only surpassing last quarter&#8217;s expectations from Wall Street, but also topping guidance. So why aren&#8217;t the share moving north after-hours? Simply put, Broadcom has rallied a remarkable 78% since April 4th, so plenty of optimism was built in headed into these earnings. A slight beat and guide for the coming quarter above consensus is generally expected when stocks have rallied as furiously as Broadcom has in recent months. Make no mistake, Broadcom&#8217;s quarter was solid and its guidance for next quarter points to continuing momentum. However, the results are also not far enough above consensus to move the needle much after Broadcom&#8217;s recent run. Broadcom Shares are Rebounding 4:29 pm by Joel South Broadcom shares are rebounding, now roughly flat after initially dropping several percent after the company&#8217;s earnings release. Shares Slide Despite Record Q2 Results on Surging AI Demand 4:26 pm by Joel South Broadcom posted strong Q2 results, with revenue climbing 20% year-over-year to a record $15 billion, fueled by rapid growth in AI semiconductor demand and contributions from VMware. The company reported GAAP net income of $5 billion and non-GAAP net income of $7.8 billion. Adjusted EBITDA rose 35% to $10.0 billion, representing 67% of revenue. AI revenue reached $4.4 billion in Q2, up 46% from the previous year, and is projected to grow further to $5.1 billion in Q3. CEO Hock Tan noted continued investment from hyperscale partners and 10 straight quarters of AI revenue growth. Broadcom also generated $6.4 billion in free cash flow, returning $7 billion to shareholders via dividends and share buybacks. The company expects Q3 revenue of approximately $15.8 billion, up 21% year-over-year, and maintains strong profitability guidance. Despite this, shares slipped in after-hour trading 28.6% from the close. Execution Risks 3:33 pm by Joel South Despite strong momentum, Broadcom’s Q2 setup is not without potential downside risks. The most immediate is hyperscaler AI capex cyclicality. While demand remains strong, cloud buildouts can be lumpy, and any signal of Q3 digestion or budget reallocation — especially in networking — could imply slower sequential growth, even if the long-term trajectory remains intact. On the software side, customer churn within VMware remains a meaningful risk. Broadcom’s go-to-market changes — including consolidation of SKUs and tighter bundling — could alienate long-time customers, especially in segments like EUC (End-User Computing) that are being divested or deemphasized. If bookings slow or renewal rates dip below plan, the market may question whether VMware revenue is truly durable. Another issue is regulatory scrutiny and deal pipeline constraints. Broadcom has long relied on M&amp;A to build scale and pricing power. But with global regulators now increasingly aggressive, further transformative acquisitions could face long timelines or outright rejection, limiting long-term inorganic growth potential. Finally, valuation has expanded significantly. The stock trades at ~25x forward EPS — toward the high end of its historical range. That leaves limited room for error on the Q2 results or full-year guide. If margins contract, or if guidance remains unchanged despite tailwinds, the bar may prove too high. Keys to Watch 3:32 pm by Joel South 1. GenAI Ethernet Momentum and ASP Trends:The durability of Broadcom’s AI networking tailwind is the single most important question heading into this release. Investors want to know if demand from hyperscalers is accelerating, stabilizing, or softening — and whether AVGO is gaining share vs. InfiniBand-based alternatives like Nvidia’s Mellanox stack. A beat in networking and bullish comments on demand visibility into 2H FY24 would reinforce Broadcom’s role as a backbone infrastructure supplier for AI training and inference clusters. 2. VMware Margins, Churn, and Booking Signals:While headline growth will be boosted by VMware consolidation, investors care more about how profitable those dollars are. If VMware segment operating margin exceeds 60% or gross margin trends toward the high-70s, the software synergy thesis gains credibility. Watch closely for commentary on customer renewals, Net Revenue Retention (NRR), and any soft patches in product overlap areas. 3. Guidance Lift and Fiscal Discipline:Management has guided conservatively over the past year, often beating internally restrained expectations. If Broadcom raises its full-year revenue outlook to $51B or above and holds EBITDA margin at 60%, it would confirm confidence in both software execution and sustained AI spend. That could justify further multiple expansion in the mid-20x EPS range. Core Results &amp; Segment Highlights 3:31 pm by Joel South Q2 FY2024 Street Estimates: Revenue: $12.04B Adjusted EPS: $10.84 YoY Revenue Growth: +37.6% Adj. Gross Margin (guide): ~75% Adj. EBITDA Margin (guide): 60% FY24 (Implied): Full-Year Revenue Guide (prior): $50B AI Infrastructure Run-Rate (last disclosed): $1B/quarter VMware Contribution Estimate (Q2): ~$2.3B Legacy Semiconductor Core (ex-VMware): ~$9.7B Broadcom has beaten Street EPS estimates in each of the last 12 quarters. Last quarter, it reported EPS of $10.99 on $11.96B in revenue, exceeding guidance on both lines and attributing the strength primarily to AI-related Ethernet demand and an unexpectedly smooth start to VMware integration. This quarter, analysts are expecting flat-to-up sequential trends in networking, mid-single-digit growth in broadband, and mid-teens growth in wireless — all consistent with seasonal patterns. Software is expected to rise sharply YoY due to VMware, but investors will differentiate between organic Broadcom software and new VMware revenue. Most expect VMware to contribute &gt;$2B per quarter with 70–75% gross margin and 55–60% EBITDA margin — if Broadcom delivers higher, that would confirm synergy realization is ahead of pace. Notably, guidance will carry more weight than the headline numbers. Street models are anticipating an update to full-year revenue closer to $51B and potential EBITDA upside if VMware cost actions flow through earlier than planned. Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) enters its Q2 FY2024 earnings release as one of the most closely watched semiconductor and infrastructure software plays, sitting squarely at the intersection of two defining technology narratives: hyperscale AI infrastructure deployment and large-scale software consolidation. Expectations are high across the board, and the stock has reflected that enthusiasm — surging over 30% in the past month to all-time highs, with investors pricing in both generative AI upside and a smooth VMware integration path. Analysts are modeling $12.04B in revenue (+37.6% YoY) and $10.84 in adjusted EPS, with roughly $2.3B expected from VMware in its first full quarter post-acquisition. The remainder of the growth is expected to come from AI-enabling components — especially Broadcom’s switch ASICs, custom silicon, and Ethernet fabric interconnects, which are widely deployed by hyperscale customers like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. The company previously disclosed that GenAI-related sales were running at a $1B quarterly pace — and any update on that figure will be a core focus. Broadcom’s results will serve as a high-stakes litmus test for enterprise AI infrastructure demand, especially given recent mixed signals from peers. Nvidia has flagged broad-based hyperscaler spend, while Marvell noted pushouts. Broadcom’s exposure is deeper in networking, and the expectation is for that segment to grow over 50% YoY, barring any cloud digestion pause. Just as important is the VMware narrative. Management previously guided to 60% EBITDA margins on a combined basis and expressed confidence that early cost synergies would materialize faster than expected. But as VMware customer contracts turn over, the Street wants proof that Broadcom can retain revenue while simplifying the product portfolio. Any sign of subscription churn or integration friction could undercut the broader software platform thesis.

    "text": "At what age would you buy dividend stocks if you could go back in time? The Dividends subreddit was bustling after one investor asked if people regretted buying dividend stocks too early or too late in their journey. For instance, some people may regret buying dividend stocks in their 20s because they saw growth stocks outperform them for more than a decade. On the other hand, other investors may wish they got into dividend stocks in their 40s instead of waiting for their 60s due to market volatility and steep losses from unprofitable investments. Dividend investors shared their thoughts and some advice for people who are considering dividend stocks. Key Points Should you buy dividend stocks in your 20s? Redditors shared their thoughts. Dividend growth stocks make more sense for younger investors, but high-yield stocks become a priority as people get older and approach retirement. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Buy Stocks For The Long Run One of the top comments came from a Walmart (NYSE:WMT) investor who bought shares at $6 apiece and held on to them. The investor now has 1,110 shares and receives an annual dividend that is close to 16% of the initial investment. That&#8217;s the advantage of buying dividend growth stocks. These corporations pay dividends but still have plenty of growth prospects left. Even at its current level of success, Walmart still has growth opportunities. Online advertising, e-commerce, and retail locations are some of the company&#8217;s growth levers. Buying dividend stocks doesn&#8217;t mean you have to be stuck with mature, high-yield companies. For instance, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) has a dividend yield above 1% and has crushed the stock market with a 685% gain over the past five years. Why Wait To Invest? Multiple dividend investors asked why people would wait to invest. Some people said they wished they could invest when they were born, while others wished they invested in their early 20s. People weren&#8217;t expressing regret about entering stocks in their 20s and 30s. Waiting to invest doesn&#8217;t make much sense if you want to become wealthy. The longer you let your money sit in the stock market, the more time you have to compound your returns. Waiting to invest causes your money to lose value due to inflation. A high-yield savings account is better than nothing, but it can&#8217;t appreciate like dividend stocks. You only get the cash flow from a bank account, while dividend stocks can double in value over the course of 5-10 years. Transition To High-Yield Dividend Stocks When You Need Steady Income A few dividend investors said that it makes sense to diversify into high-yield stocks when they need additional income. Many investors focused on dividend growth stocks or index funds that tracked major indices like the S&amp;P 500 when they were younger. Then, they gradually sold off some of those holdings and shifted into funds with lower risk and higher yields. Every person has a different financial situation and long-term goals. If you don&#8217;t need to sell your assets within the next decade and don&#8217;t need dividend income, it may make more sense to focus on growth-oriented opportunities. However, your plans may look different if you want to sell your stocks in 1-3 years to buy a house. Then, it may be better to take a cautious approach and focus on funds that have high yields and steady growth instead of riskier funds that aim to produce 10%+ annualized returns. If you&#8217;re just getting started, you can diversify your portfolio with dividend stocks and growth-oriented stocks. Reinvesting dividends ensures that your dividend income grows over time and can eventually cover your living expenses. Monitoring dividend stocks can help you build a robust portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance.

    "text": "Key Points The NASDAQ-100 is a volatile index that offers considerable long term upside amidst its intraday turbulence. Use of financial derivatives for both risk mitigation and for potentially larger leveraged gains has become routine in the financial world, especially for QQQI and JEPQ. To qualify as a “Dividend King”, a stock must have a track record of 50 or more consecutive years of dividend increases due to the underlying issuing company’s intrinsic growth. ETF “dividend kings” are metaphorical, but may reference a head to head comparison. Are you ahead or behind on your retirement goals? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute – get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Seven of the top largest S&amp;P 500 stocks by market cap are tech industry companies that have been dubbed “The Magnificent 7” due to their remarkable tandem bull run over the past several years. These stocks are:: Apple, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Microsoft, Meta Platforms (Facebook), Nvidia, and Tesla. In order to give better focus on the tech and other higher growth sectors, which tend to be listed on NASDAQ, the NASDAQ-100 index was created to track the top 100 NASDAQ listed companies that are not in the financial sector, as the tech emphasis also purports to emphasize innovation and new products instead of financial companies, which ostensibly do not. The launch of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) that track the NASDAQ-100 index was a foregone conclusion, and several of them already vie for investor dollars on a daily basis. Two that have exhibited sizable growth but have been able to augment their gains in the form of dividends, are: The NEOS Nasdaq-100 High Income ETF (NASDAQ: QQQI), and the JP Morgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ: JEPQ). Ironically, both indexes generate their high yields through strategic innovations that rival those in the tech sector, in terms of their potential to deliver performance enhancements for their assigned tasks. How QQQI and JEPQ Compare &#8211; An Overview Both QQQI and JEPQ track the NASDAQ 1oo ETF, which is very volatile, due to its heavy weighting in the technology sector. Both ETFs are still relatively young. QQQI only launched in January, 2024 and JEPQ began in May, 2022. The following details are based on market price at the time of this writing: Category QQQI JEPQ Yield 14.55% 11.28% Net Assets $1.76 billion $26.27 billion Average Daily Volume 970,269 shares 7.29 million shares Expense Ratio 0.68% 0.35% Beta 0.00 0.83 52-week range 41.17-54.47 44.31-58.54 1-year return 14.37% 7.69% 1-year trailing return 15.24% 8.49% 3-year return n/a 14.40% Largest Hedge Fund Holder Second Half Financial Ptnrs Fisher Asset Mgmt. Sector Weighting #1 Technology &#8211; 52.41% Technology &#8211; 51.41% Sector Weighting #2 Communication Svc &#8211; 16.09% Communication Svc &#8211; 15.90% Sector Weighting #3 Consumer Cyclical &#8211; 12.85% Consumer Cyclical &#8211; 14.60% JEPQ Top 5 Holdings Symbol/Exchange Company Percentage MSFT Microsoft Corp. 7.49% NVDA Nvidia Corp 7.35% AAPL Apple, Inc. 6.47% AMZN Amazon 4.92% GOOG Alphabet Class C 3.99% QQQI Top 5 Holdings Symbol/Exchange Company Percentage MSFT Microsoft Corp. 8.61% NVDA Nvidia Corp 8.30% AAPL Apple, Inc. 7.59% AMZN Amazon 4.87% AVGO Broadcom 4.74% Strategic Differences Although they both utilize covered call options for creating dividends, JEPQ&#8217;s use of ELNs is more conservative than QQQI&#8217;s direct trading of out of the money calls in addition to its portfolio covered call writing. Both JEPQ and QQQI utilize option strategies to artificially create dividends for their shareholders. However there are both mechanical and risk/reward differences in their respective approaches. JEPQ uses Equity Linked Notes (ELNs), which are synthetic financial products created by financial institutions, and are linked to a particular index or stock. ELNs usually have a call option attached to a principal protection component, and can be likened to a short-term zero-coupon bond with a maturity of no longer than a few months. The returns on the ELN are linked to the underlying index or stock. Additionally, most, if not all ELNs are purchased directly from the issuer and held to maturity. There is no secondary market for ELNs. JEPQ manager Hamilton Reiner staggers one-month calls into multiple weekly buckets, then diversifies the expiration dates and strike prices. However, Reiner conducts this strategy with purchases of ELNs that give the JEPQ exposure to the profits on those call options, without the risk of any of the top tech stock holdings being subject to calls if the market takes off and the calls go in-the-money. Conversely, QQQI also utilizes a covered call strategy, in addition to out of the money call purchases to augment upside gains. QQQI writes their covered calls directly against the NASDAQ-100 index up to 100% of the equity value of total QQQI holdings. The fund then uses a portion of their covered call premium income to purchase out of the money call options. This give it the following result scenarios: If the market ends relatively flat, QQQI has kept the premium income minus the cost of the out of the money options. If the market jumps up, the underwritten covered call is already hedged against stocks, but QQQI can take profit on the out of the money call that ostensibly would be in the money due to the jump. Overall Analysis and The King of the Hill In This Competition For 1 year&#8217;s yield comparison, QQQI wins the &#8220;King of the Hill&#8221; contest against JEPQ, but has 49 years to go of upping the yield ante annually before being able to claim a &#8220;Dividend King&#8221; title. Selling covered calls is considered a viable strategy to mitigate volatility and take advantage of market volatility, which usually means increased delta and subsequently larger premiums. However, there is a reason why there is a sizable enough market on the buy side &#8211; there are enough people who think the option will increase in value. However, selling calls can limit interim upside, especially if the goal is for the option to expire worthless so the same underlying securities can cover another call writing opportunity next month. President Thomas Jefferson was once quoted, “ With risk comes great reward.” QQQI’s superior yield is a testament to the reward from being more aggressive and taking on more risk than JEPQ. However, with only slightly over 1 years’ worth of trading history and returns from which to judge, QQQI may be the dividend “king of the hill” only for the moment. Whether a consistent track record can be built or not on the QQQI strategy model, which needs to be actively managed by their presumably disciplined managers, remains to be seen. Since both companies’ dividends are artificially created through trading against market volatility, as opposed to intrinsic enhanced value through a business, the ability for JEPQ and QQQI rests solely on skill and knowledge of its managers. If they can first reach Dividend Aristocrat status (25 or more years of consecutive, annual dividend increases), then perhaps a hypothetical Dividend King discussion (50 consecutive years or more of dividend increases) can be had.
